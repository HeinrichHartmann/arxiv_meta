Our methodology is dictated by our purpose of obtaining purely\nphotometric, minimal-scatter estimators of V_rot applicable to large galaxy\nsamples from imaging surveys. To achieve this goal, we have constructed a\nsample of 189 disk galaxies at redshifts z<0.1 with long-slit H-alpha\nspectroscopy from Pizagno et al. (2007) and new observations.

Our simple tight-binding model, that includes the SOC\nof the $2p$ orbitals of F and effective parameters based on maximally localized\nWannier functions, is able to account for the effect.

These SFGs were targeted for spectroscopy based on their\nphotometric redshifts. The VUDS spectra are used to measure the UV spectral\nslopes ($\\beta$) as well as Ly$\\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW). On average, the\nspectroscopically measured $\\beta$ (-1.36$\\pm$0.02), is comparable to the\nphotometrically measured $\\beta$ (-1.32$\\pm$0.02), and has smaller measurement\nuncertainties. The positive correlation of $\\beta$ with the Spectral Energy\nDistribution (SED)-based measurement of dust extinction, E$_{\\rm s}$(B-V),\nemphasizes the importance of $\\beta$ as an alternative dust indicator at high\nredshifts.

It has been shown\nrecently that a low-mass classical bulge (ClB) in a barred galaxy can acquire\nrotation from absorbing a significant fraction of the angular momentum emitted\nby the bar. Our aim here is to investigate whether bars can spin up also more\nmassive ClBs during the secular evolution of the bar, and to study the\nkinematics and dynamics of these ClBs. We use a set of self-consistent N-body\nsimulations to study the interaction of ClBs with a bar that forms\nself-consistently in the disk. We use orbital spectral analysis to investigate\nthe angular momentum gain by the classical bulge stars. We show that the ClBs\ngain, on average, about 2 - 6% of the disk's initial angular momentum within\nthe bar region. Most of this angular momentum gain occurs via low-order\nresonances, particularly 5:2 resonant orbits. A density wake forms in the ClB\nwhich corotates and aligns with the bar at the end of the evolution. The\nspin-up process creates a characteristic linear rotation profile and mild\ntangential anisotropy in the ClB. The induced rotation is small in the centre\nbut significant beyond $\\sim2$ bulge half mass radii, where it leads to\nmass-weighted $V/\\sigma \\sim 0.2$, and reaches a local $V_{max}/\\sigma_{in}\n\\sim 0.5$ at around the scale of the bar. The resulting $V/\\sigma$ is tightly\ncorrelated with the ratio of the bulge size to the bar size. In all models, a\nbox/peanut bulge forms suggesting that composite bulges may be common.\nBar-bulge resonant interaction in barred galaxies can provide some spin up of\nmassive ClBs, but the process appears to be less efficient than for low-mass\nClBs. Further angular momentum transfer due to nuclear bars or gas inflow would\nbe required to explain the observed rotation if it is not primordial.\n","Comment: 11 Pages, 14 figures; accepted for publication by A & A"]}]

In the\nframework of star-quake model, based on~\\cite{Baym1971}, the glitch-sizes (the\nrelative increases of spin-frequencies during glitches) $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$\ndepend on the released energies during glitches, with less released energies\ncorresponding to smaller glitch sizes. On the other hand, as one of dark matter\ncandidates, our Galaxy might be filled with the so called strange nuggets (SNs)\nwhich are the relics from the early Universe. In this case the collisions\nbetween pulsars and SNs is inevitable, and these collisions would lead to\nglitches when enough elastic energy has been accumulated during the spin-down\nprocess. The SNs-triggered glitches could release less energy, because the\naccumulated elastic energy would be less than that in the scenario of glitches\nwithout SNs. Therefore, if a pulsar is hit frequently by SNs, it would tend to\nhave more small size glitches, whose values of $\\Delta \\Omega/\\Omega$ are\nsmaller than that in standard star-quake model (with larger amounts of released\nenergy). Based on the assumption that in our Galaxy the distribution of SNs is\nsimilar to that of dark matter, as well as on the glitch data in ATNF Pulsar\nCatalogue and Jodrell Bank glitch table, we find that in our Galaxy the\nincidences of small size glitches exhibit tendencies consistent with the\ncollision rates of pulsars and strange nuggets. Further test of this scenario\nis expected by detecting more small glitches (e.g., by the Square Kilometre\nArray).\n","Comment: 11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table. Accepted by RAA"]}]

We combine a hydrodynamic simulation that includes nuclear\nburning of the disruption of a $0.6 M_\\odot$ C/O WD with a Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer calculation to synthesize the properties of a representative\ntransient. The transient's emission emerges in the optical, with lightcurves\nand spectra reminiscent of type I SNe. The properties are strongly\nviewing-angle dependent, and key spectral signatures are $\\approx 10,000$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Doppler shifts due to the orbital motion of the unbound ejecta.\nDisruptions of He WDs likely produce large quantities of intermediate-mass\nelements, offering a possible production mechanism for Ca-rich transients.\nAccompanying multiwavelength transients are fueled by accretion and arise from\nthe nascent accretion disk and relativistic jet. If MBHs of moderate mass exist\nwith number densities similar to those of supermassive MBHs, both high energy\nwide-field monitors and upcoming optical surveys should detect tens to hundreds\nof WD tidal disruptions per year. The current best strategy for their detection\nmay therefore be deep optical follow up of high-energy transients of\nunusually-long duration. The detection rate or the non-detection of these\ntransients by current and upcoming surveys can thus be used to place meaningful\nconstraints on the extrapolation of the MBH mass function to moderate masses.\n","Comment: Revised following peer review; ApJ accepted"]}]

They found a near-exact cancellation\nbetween three- and four-mode interactions and concluded that while the tide in\nbinary neutron stars can be p-g unstable, the growth rates are not fast enough\nto impact the gravitational wave signal. Their analysis assumes that the linear\ntide is incompressible, which is true of the static linear tide (the m=0\nharmonic) but not the non-static linear tide (m=+/- 2). Here we account for the\ncompressibility of the non-static linear tide and find that the three- and\nfour-mode interactions no longer cancel. As a result, we find that the\ninstability can rapidly drive modes to significant energies (there is time for\nseveral dozen e-foldings of growth before the binary merges). We also show that\nlinear damping interferes with the cancellation and may further enhance the p-g\ngrowth rates. The early onset of the instability (at gravitational wave\nfrequencies near 50 Hz), the rapid growth rates, and the large number of\nunstable modes (> 10^3), suggest that the instability could impact the phase\nevolution of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars. Assessing its\nimpact will require an understanding of how the instability saturates and is\nleft to future work.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 14 figures, matches version published in ApJ"]}]

The central\nproblem is a quadratic optimization problem with an l0-norm penalty. Exactly\nenforcing the l0-norm penalty is computationally intractable for larger scale\nproblems, so dif- ferent sparsity-inducing penalty functions that approximate\nthe l0-norm have been introduced. In this paper, we show that viewing the\nproblem from a convex relaxation perspective offers new insights. In\nparticular, we show that a popular sparsity-inducing concave penalty function\nknown as the Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP), and the reverse Huber penalty\nderived in a recent work by Pilanci, Wainwright and Ghaoui, can both be derived\nas special cases of a lifted convex relaxation called the perspective\nrelaxation. The optimal perspective relaxation is a related minimax problem\nthat balances the overall convexity and tightness of approximation to the l0\nnorm. We show it can be solved by a semidefinite relaxation. Moreover, a\nprobabilistic interpretation of the semidefinite relaxation reveals connections\nwith the boolean quadric polytope in combinatorial optimization. Finally by\nreformulating the l0-norm pe- nalized problem as a two-level problem, with the\ninner level being a Max-Cut problem, our proposed semidefinite relaxation can\nbe realized by replacing the inner level problem with its semidefinite\nrelaxation studied by Goemans and Williamson. This interpretation suggests\nusing the Goemans-Williamson rounding procedure to find approximate solutions\nto the l0-norm penalized problem.

These\nobservations will be spread among ugrizy bandpasses, providing photometric\ncolors and allowing sparse lightcurve inversion to determine rotation periods,\nspin axes, and shape information.\n  These catalogs will be created using automated detection software, the LSST\nMoving Object Processing System (MOPS), that will take advantage of the\ncarefully characterized LSST optical system, cosmetically clean camera, and\nrecent improvements in difference imaging. Tests with the prototype MOPS\nsoftware indicate that linking detections (and thus discovery) will be possible\nat LSST depths with our working model for the survey strategy, but evaluation\nof MOPS and improvements in the survey strategy will continue.

However, both planets are at close enough separations to have\nundergone significant evaporation in the past. We constrain the core-mass, core\ncomposition, initial envelope-mass, and initial cooling-time of each planet\nusing evaporation models conditioned on their present-day masses and radii, as\ninferred from Kepler photometry and transit timing analysis. The inner planet\nis consistent with being an evaporatively stripped core, while the outer planet\nhas retained some of its initial envelope due to its higher core-mass.\nTherefore, both planets could have had a similar formation pathway, with the\ninner planet having an initial envelope-mass fraction of $\\lesssim 10\\%$ and\ncore-mass of $\\sim4.4$ M$_\\oplus$, while the outer had an initial envelope-mass\nfraction of order 15-30\\% and core-mass $\\sim7.3$ M$_\\oplus$. Finally, our\nresults indicate that the outer planet had a long ($\\gtrsim30$ Myr) initial\ncooling-time, much longer than would naively be predicted from simple timescale\narguments. The long initial cooling-time could be evidence for a dramatic early\ncooling episode such as the recently proposed \"boil-off\" process.\n","Comment: Accepted version in ApJL, 6 pages, 3 figures"]}]

This is of\nspecial importance for the interpretation of Type I X-ray bursts, which are\npowered by the thermonuclear burning of matter accreted onto the neutron star.\nBecause part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst\nflux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star\nand reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance,\nmass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star equation of state.\nPrevious studies made predictions of the anisotropy factor for the total burst\nflux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. Recently, detailed observations of\ntwo exceptionally long bursts (so-called superbursts) allowed for the first\ntime for the direct and the reflected burst flux to each be measured, as\nopposed to just their sum. The ratio of the reflected and direct flux (the\nreflection fraction) was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk\ncan account for.

We present CO(1-0) and (2-1) observations, further\nsupplemented with additional CO measurements and multiwavelength ancillary data\nfrom the literature. We find the CO luminosity to be correlated with the\nstellar and HI masses, SFR tracers, the size of the starburst and its\nmetallicity. BCDs appear offset from the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) law, showing\nextremely low ($\\lesssim$0.1 Gyr) H2 and H2+HI depletion timescales. The\ndeparture from the SK law is smaller when considering H2+HI rather than H2\nonly, and is larger for BCDs with lower metallicity and higher specific SFR.\nThus, the molecular fraction and H2 depletion timescale of BCDs is found to be\nstrongly correlated with metallicity. Using this and assuming that the\nempirical correlation found between the specific SFR and galaxy-averaged H2\ndepletion timescale of more metal-rich galaxies extends to lower masses, we\nderive a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H2 conversion factor $\\alpha_{CO, Z}\n\\propto (Z/Z_{\\odot})^{-y}$, with $y=1.5(\\pm 0.3)$ in qualitative agreement\nwith previous determinations, dust-based measurements, and recent model\npredictions.

The calcium II\ntriplet (CaT) index has recently become a popular metal abundance indicator\nthanks to its sensitivity to GC metallicity. Here we revisit and assess the\nreliability of CaT as a metallicity indicator using our new stellar population\nsynthesis simulations based on empirical, high-resolution fluxes. The model\nshows that the CaT strength of old ($>$ 10 Gyr) GCs is proportional to ${\\rm\n[Fe/H]}$ below $-0.5$. In the modest metal-rich regime, however, CaT does not\nincrease anymore with ${\\rm [Fe/H]}$ due to the little contribution from\ncoolest red giant stars to the CaT absorption. The nonlinear nature of the\ncolor--$CaT$ relation is confirmed by the observations of GCs in nearby\nearly-type galaxies. This indicates that the CaT should be used carefully when\nderiving metallicities of metal-rich stellar populations. Our results offer an\nexplanation for the observed sharp difference between the color and $CaT$\ndistributions of GCs in the same galaxies. We take this as an analogy to the\nview that metallicity--color and metallicity--Lick index nonlinearity of GCs is\nprimarily responsible for their observed \"bimodal\" distributions of colors and\nabsorption indices.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Mass distribution models can then be directly fitted to asymmetric\nline-of-sight velocity fields.

A cuspy inner density profile of\ndark matter is found in M99, in the usual case where luminous and dark matter\nshare the same center. The impact of the velocity nonuniformity is to make the\ninner profile less steep, although the density remains cuspy. On another hand,\na model where the halo is core dominated and shifted by 2.2-2.5 kpc from the\nluminous mass center is more appropriate to explain most of the kinematical\nlopsidedness evidenced in the velocity field of M99.

The WA in NGC 5548 is composed of 6 distinct\nionization phases outflowing in 4 kinematic regimes in the form of a stratified\nwind with several layers intersected by our line of sight. If the changes in\nthe WA are solely due to ionization or recombination processes in response to\nvariations in the ionizing flux among the different observations, we are able\nto estimate lower limits on the density of the WA, finding that the farthest\ncomponents are less dense and have a lower ionization. These limits are used to\nput stringent upper limits on the distance of the WA components from the\ncentral ionizing source, with the lowest ionization phases <50, <20, and <5 pc,\nrespectively, while the intermediately ionized components lie at <3.6 and <2.2\npc from the center, respectively. The highest ionization component is located\nat ~0.6 pc or closer to the AGN central engine. The mass outflow rate summed\nover all WA components is ~0.3 Msun/yr, about six times the nominal accretion\nrate of the source. The total kinetic luminosity injected into the ISM is a\nsmall fraction (~0.03%) of the bolometric luminosity of the source.

We test this\nhypothesis using detailed disk models, including a sophisticated, new disk\nionization treatment with a low cosmic ray ionization rate, and find that disk\nchemistry leads to higher deuterium enrichment in organics compared to water,\nhelped especially by fractionation via the precursors CH$_2$D$^+$/CH$_3^+$.

We find that the phase lag between two broad energy bands\nsystematically increases for $5$ - $10$ QPO cycles, after which the QPO becomes\ndecoherent, the phase lag resets and the pattern repeats. This shows that the\nband with the higher QPO frequency is running away from the other band on short\ntimescales, providing strong evidence that the energy dependence of the QPO\nfrequency is intrinsic.

In this context, a natural question\nthat arises is how efficient are social media users at selecting their\ninformation sources.\n  In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify users'\nefficiency at selecting information sources. Our framework is based on the\nassumption that the goal of users is to acquire a set of unique pieces of\ninformation. To quantify user's efficiency, we ask if the user could have\nacquired the same pieces of information from another set of sources more\nefficiently. We define three different notions of efficiency -- link, in-flow,\nand delay -- corresponding to the number of sources the user follows, the\namount of (redundant) information she acquires and the delay with which she\nreceives the information. Our definitions of efficiency are general and\napplicable to any social media system with an underlying information network,\nin which every user follows others to receive the information they produce.\n  In our experiments, we measure the efficiency of Twitter users at acquiring\ndifferent types of information. We find that Twitter users exhibit sub-optimal\nefficiency across the three notions of efficiency, although they tend to be\nmore efficient at acquiring non-popular than popular pieces of information. We\nthen show that this lack of efficiency is a consequence of the triadic closure\nmechanism by which users typically discover and follow other users in social\nmedia.

In animal studies acoustic trauma can lead to behavioral signs of\nST, in human studies ST patients without increased hearing thresholds were\nfound to suffer from so called hidden HL. Additionally, ST is correlated with\npathologically increased spontaneous firing rates and neuronal hyperactivity\n(NH) along the auditory pathway. Homeostatic plasticity (HP) has been proposed\nas a compensation mechanism leading to the development of NH, arguing that\nafter HL initially decreased mean firing rates of neurons are subsequently\nrestored by increased spontaneous rates. However all HP models fundamentally\nlack explanatory power since the function of keeping mean firing rate constant\nremains elusive as does the benefit this might have in terms of information\nprocessing. Furthermore the neural circuitry being able to perform the\ncomparison of preferred with actual mean firing rate remains unclear.

The increased amount of internal noise is the\ncorrelate of the NH, which finally leads to the development of ST, due to\nneuronal plasticity along the auditory pathway.
