Firstly, we derive its structural properties by\nconstructing a stellar surface density map of the central 1000\" using\nextinction corrected star counts from VISTA, WFC3/IR and VLT/NACO data. We can\ndescribe the profile with a two-component model. The inner, slightly flattened\n(q=0.80+/-0.04) component is the nuclear cluster, while the outer component\ncorresponds to the stellar component of the circumnuclear zone. We measure for\nthe nuclear cluster a half-light radius of 178+/-51\"~7+/-2 pc and a luminosity\nof M_Ks=-16.0+/-0.5. Secondly, we enlarge the range over which detailed\ndynamics are available from 1 pc to 4 pc. We obtain more than 10000 individual\nproper motions from NACO data, and more than 2500 radial velocities from\nVLT/SINFONI data.

Related theoretical works disagree on whether or not\nstrong-coupling superconductivity is required to explain such effects, and\nwhether a critical interaction strength exists. In this work, we consider\nvarious versions of the model problem of pairing of electrons in the presence\nof an incipient band, within a simple multiband weak-coupling BCS\napproximation. We categorize the problem into two cases: case(I) where\nsuperconductivity arises from the \"incipient band pairing\" alone, and case(II)\nwhere it is induced on an incipient band by pairing due to Fermi-surface based\ninteractions. Negative conclusions regarding the importance of incipient bands\nhave been drawn so far largely based on case(I), but we show explicitly that\nmodels under case(II) are qualitatively different, and can explain the\nnon-exponential suppression of Tc, as well as robust large gaps on an incipient\nband. In the latter situation, large gaps on the incipient band do not require\na critical interaction strength. We also model the interplay between phonon and\nspin fluctuation driven superconductivity and describe the bootstrap of\nelectron-phonon superconductivity by spin fluctuations coupling the incipient\nand the regular bands. Finally, we discuss the effect of the dimensionality of\nthe incipient band on our results.

Steady solutions of the dynamical system\nwhich governs the evolution of the helical modes are determined, and a\nstability analysis of these solutions is carried out. The interpretation of the\nanalysis is that unstable solutions lead to energy transfer between the\ninteracting modes while stable solutions do not. From this, a dependence of\npossible interscale energy and helicity transfers on the helicities of the\ninteracting modes is derived. As expected from the inverse cascade of magnetic\nhelicity in 3D MHD turbulence, mode interactions with like helicities lead to\ntransfer of energy and magnetic helicity to smaller wavenumbers. However, some\ninteractions of modes with unlike helicities also contribute to an inverse\nenergy transfer. As such, an inverse energy cascade for nonhelical magnetic\nfields is shown to be possible. Furthermore, it is found that high values of\nthe cross-helicity may have an asymmetric effect on forward and reverse\ntransfer of energy, where forward transfer is more quenched in regions of high\ncross-helicity than reverse transfer.

The main advantage of using such constrained micromorphic model is\nthat the kinematical and traction boundary conditions that can be imposed on\nthe boundary of the considered body take a natural and unique meaning.\n  The discrete model is set up by opportunely interconnecting Euler-Bernoulli\nbeams with different bending stiffnesses in the two directions by means of\nrotational and translational elastic springs. The main advantage of such\ndiscrete model is that the slipping of the tows is described in a rather\nrealistic way. Suitable numerical simulations are presented for both the\ncontinuum and the discrete models and a comparison between the simulations and\nthe experimental results is made showing a definitely good agreement.\n"]}]

Recently, through the use of fluorescently-tagged\nlipids, it has become possible to make direct, quantitative comparisons between\nexperiments and models. These comparisons have revealed two important\ndiscrepancies between simulations and experiments: the spatial distribution of\nthe surfactant layer, and the timescale over which spreading occurs. In this\npaper, we present numerical simulations that demonstrate the impact of the\nparticular choice of the equation of state (EoS) relating the surfactant\nconcentration to the surface tension. Previous choices of the model EoS have\nbeen an ad-hoc decreasing function. Here, we instead propose an\nempirically-motivated equation of state; this provides a route to resolving\nsome discrepancies and raises new issues to be pursued in future experiments.\nIn addition, we test the influence of the choice of initial conditions and\nvalues for the non-dimensional groups. We demonstrate that the choice of EoS\nimproves the agreement in surfactant distribution morphology between\nsimulations and experiments, and impacts the dynamics of the simulations. The\nrelevant feature of the EoS, the gradient, has distinct regions for empirically\nmotivated choices, which suggests that future work will need to consider more\nthan one timescale. We observe that the non-dimensional number controlling the\nrelative importance of gravitational vs. capillary forces has a larger impact\non the dynamics than the other non-dimensional groups.

By\nrestriction, this construction contains the construction of invariants for\nclassical links from classical Yokonuma--Hecke algebras. In general, the\nobtained invariants form an infinite family of 3-variables polynomials. As a\nconsequence of the construction via the isomorphism, we reduce the number of\ninvariants to study, given the number of connected components of a link.

This article builds\non the structure developed in Paper I in order to rigorously express the\npolarimetric SC image in terms of the field impinging on the wavefront sensor\n(WFS), thereby providing a direct connection between the measurements made in\nboth subsystems. This formulation allows the SC image to be written as a\nfunction of the WFS measurements, including the following unknown quantities\nwhich can, in principle, be estimated via statistical inference: the non-common\npath aberration (NCPA), WFS gain errors, aberrations downstream of the\nbeamsplitter, and the planetary image. It is demonstrated that WFS bias error\nis mathematically equivalent to NCPA. Thus, with the ability to treat WFS bias\nand gains, the method should not be overly sensitive to WFS calibration\nproblems. Importantly, this formulation includes stochastic processes that\nrepresent noisy measurement of the SC image, noisy WFS measurements, and\nhigh-frequency components of the wavefront to which the WFS is insensitive. It\nis shown that wavefront error due to noise in the WFS measurements has a\nconvenient semi-analytical representation in terms of the WFS measurement\noperator's singular functions. Further, the first and second order statistics\nof these processes are specified, thereby setting the stage for the application\nof statistical inference methods to be describe in later papers in this series.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

Characterizing the cooperative beamforming with fronthaul capacity and\nqueue stability constraints is critical for multimedia applications to\nimproving energy efficiency (EE) in H-CRANs. An energy-efficient optimization\nobjective function with individual fronthaul capacity and inter-tier\ninterference constraints is presented in this paper for queue-aware multimedia\nH-CRANs. To solve this non-convex objective function, a stochastic optimization\nproblem is reformulated by introducing the general Lyapunov optimization\nframework. Under the Lyapunov framework, this optimization problem is\nequivalent to an optimal network-wide cooperative beamformer design algorithm\nwith instantaneous power, average power and inter-tier interference\nconstraints, which can be regarded as the weighted sum EE maximization problem\nand solved by a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach. The\nmathematical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that a tradeoff\nbetween EE and queuing delay can be achieved, and this tradeoff strictly\ndepends on the fronthaul constraint.\n"]}]

One problem of Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing\n(NHST), the backbone of A/B testing methodology, is that experimenters are not\nallowed to continuously monitor the result and make decision in real time. Many\npeople see this restriction as a setback against the trend in the technology\ntoward real time data analytics. Recently, Bayesian Hypothesis Testing, which\nintuitively is more suitable for real time decision making, attracted growing\ninterest as an alternative to NHST. While corrections of NHST for the\ncontinuous monitoring setting are well established in the existing literature\nand known in A/B testing community, the debate over the issue of whether\ncontinuous monitoring is a proper practice in Bayesian testing exists among\nboth academic researchers and general practitioners. In this paper, we formally\nprove the validity of Bayesian testing with continuous monitoring when proper\nstopping rules are used, and illustrate the theoretical results with concrete\nsimulation illustrations. We point out common bad practices where stopping\nrules are not proper and also compare our methodology to NHST corrections.\nGeneral guidelines for researchers and practitioners are also provided.\n"]}]

Due to limited bandwidth available\nat both top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches and tenants in different\nservice classes need differentiated services, network bandwidth must be\napportioned among different intra- and inter-rack data flows for different\nservice classes in line with their traffic statistics. We formulate this\nproblem as weighted queuing and employ a class of probabilistic request\nscheduling policies to derive a closed-form upper-bound of service latency for\nerasure-coded storage with arbitrary file access patterns and service time\ndistributions. The result enables us to propose a joint weighted latency (over\ndifferent service classes) optimization over three entangled \"control knobs\":\nthe bandwidth allocation at top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches for\ndifferent service classes, dynamic scheduling of file requests, and the\nplacement of encoded file chunks (i.e., data locality). The joint optimization\nis shown to be a mixed-integer problem. We develop an iterative algorithm which\ndecouples and solves the joint optimization as 3 sub-problems, which are either\nconvex or solvable via bipartite matching in polynomial time. The proposed\nalgorithm is prototyped in an open-source, distributed file system, {\\em\nTahoe}, and evaluated on a cloud testbed with 16 separate physical hosts in an\nOpenstack cluster using 48-port Cisco Catalyst switches.

First, we\npropose robust kernel covariance operator (robust kernel CO) and robust kernel\ncrosscovariance operator (robust kernel CCO) based on a generalized loss\nfunction instead of the quadratic loss function. Second, we propose influence\nfunction of classical kernel canonical correlation analysis (classical kernel\nCCA).

Finally, we propose a\nmethod based on robust kernel CO and robust kernel CCO, called robust kernel\nCCA, which is designed for contaminated data and less sensitive to noise than\nclassical kernel CCA. The principles we describe also apply to many kernel\nmethods which must deal with the issue of kernel CO or kernel CCO.
