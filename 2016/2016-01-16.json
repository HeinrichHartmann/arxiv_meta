In order to solve\npartial differential equations on such domains, a range of numerical methods\nwas developed, e.g. the Immersed Boundary method, Unfitted Finite Element or\nUnfitted discontinuous Galerkin methods, eXtended or Generalised Finite Element\nmethods, just to name a few. Many of these methods involve integration over\ncut-cells or their boundaries, as they are described by sub-domains of the\noriginal level-set mesh. We present a new algorithm to geometrically evaluate\nthe integrals over domains described by a first-order, conforming level-set\nfunction. The integration is based on a polyhedral reconstruction of the\nimplicit geometry, following the concepts of the Marching Cubes algorithm. The\nalgorithm preserves various topological properties of the implicit geometry in\nits polyhedral reconstruction, making it suitable for Finite Element\ncomputations. Numerical experiments show second order accuracy of the\nintegration. An implementation of the algorithm is available as free software,\nwhich allows for an easy incorporation into other projects. The software is in\nproductive use within the DUNE framework.\n"]}]
