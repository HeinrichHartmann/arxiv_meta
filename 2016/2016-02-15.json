As long as there exists a capillary bridge in the system, the magnitude\nof the excess total critical Casimir force is almost constant, with its\ndirection depending on $L$.

One can also study the\nreverse problem of expressing the vertices of a given graph as distinct sets in\nsuch a way that adjacency coincides with intersection of the corresponding\nsets. The sets are usually required to conform to some template, depending on\nthe problem, to be either a finite set, or some geometric set like intervals,\ncircles, discs, cubes etc. The problem of representing a graph as an\nintersection graph of sets was first introduced by Erdos and they looked at\nminimising the underlying universal set necessary to represent any given graph.\nIn that paper it was shown that the problem is NP complete.

When taken across\nthe spectrum of all graphs the two problems are evidently identical. Our\nmotivation to look at disjointness instead of intersection is that several well\nknown graphs like the Petersen graph and Knesser graphs are expressed in the\nlatter method, and the complements of these families are not well studied.

Binary and ternary mixtures were prepared from monodisperse PS with\nweight average molecular weights $5 < M_\\textrm{w} < 490$ kg/mol. Flow dynamics\nand rim morphology of dewetting holes were captured using optical and atomic\nforce microscopy. Slip properties are assessed in the framework of hydrodynamic\nmodels describing the rim height profile of dewetting holes. We show that short\nchains with $M_\\textrm{w}$ below the polymer critical molecular weight for\nentanglements, $M_\\textrm{c}$, can play an important role in slip of highly\nentangled polymers. Among mixtures of the same $M_\\textrm{w}$, those containing\nchains with $M<M_\\textrm{c}$ exhibit larger slip lengths as the number average\nmolecular weight, $M_\\textrm{n}$, decreases. The slip enhancement effect is\nonly applicable when chains with $M<M_\\textrm{c}$ are mixed with highly\nentangled chains such that the content of the long chain component,\n$\\phi_\\textrm{L}$, is dominant ($\\phi_\\textrm{L}<0.5$). These results suggest\nthat short chains affect slip of highly entangled polymers on non-wetting\nsurfaces due to the physical or chemical disparities of end groups, and any\nassociated dynamical effect their presence may have, as compared to the\nbackbone units. The enhanced slip in this regard is attributed to the impact of\nchain end groups or short chain enrichment on the effective interfacial\nfriction coefficient. Accordingly, for entangled PS, a higher concentration of\nend groups or short chains at the interface results in a lower effective\nfriction coefficient which consequently enhances the slip length.\n"]}]

A relevant further step was achieved in 2005 when the possibility was\nadvanced that they could reflect an entire infinite algebra based on\ncombinations of the self-dual relations $q \\to 2-q$ ({\\it additive duality})\nand $q \\to 1/q$ ({\\it multiplicative duality}). The entire algebra collapses\ninto the single fixed point $q=1$, corresponding to the Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy\nand statistical mechanics. For $q \\ne 1$, an infinite set of indices $q$\nappears, corresponding in principle to an infinite number of physical\nproperties of a given complex system describable in terms of the so called\n$q$-statistics. The basic idea that is put forward is that, for a given\nuniversality class of systems, a small number (typically one or two) of\nindependent $q$ indices exist, the infinite others being obtained from these\nfew ones by simply using the relations of the algebra. The $q$-triplets appear\nto constitute a few central elements of the algebra. During the last decade, an\nimpressive amount of $q$-triplets have been exhibited in analytical,\ncomputational, experimental and observational results in natural, artificial\nand social systems. Some of them do satisfy the available algebra constructed\nsolely with the additive and multiplicative dualities, but some others seem to\nviolate it. In the present work we generalize those two dualities with the hope\nthat a wider set of systems can be handled within. The basis of the\ngeneralization is given by the {\\it selfdual} relation $q \\to q_a(q) \\equiv\n\\frac{(a+2) -aq}{a-(a-2)q} \\,\\, (a \\in {\\cal R})$. We verify that $q_a(1)=1$,\nand that $q_2(q)=2-q$ and $q_0(q)=1/q$. To physically motivate this\ngeneralization, we briefly review illustrative applications of $q$-statistics,\nin order to exhibit possible candidates where the present generalized algebras\ncould be useful.\n","Comment: 10 pages, including 2 Tables and 1 Figure.

We present a generalized greedy\npursuit framework, allowing us to efficiently solve structured matrix\nfactorization problems, where the factors are allowed to be from arbitrary sets\nof structured vectors. Such structure may include sparsity, non-negativeness,\norder, or a combination thereof. The algorithm approximates a given matrix by a\nlinear combination of few rank-1 matrices, each factorized into an outer\nproduct of two vector atoms of the desired structure. For the non-convex\nsubproblems of obtaining good rank-1 structured matrix atoms, we employ and\nanalyze a general atomic power method. In addition to the above applications,\nwe prove linear convergence for generalized pursuit variants in Hilbert spaces\n- for the task of approximation over the linear span of arbitrary dictionaries\n- which generalizes OMP and is useful beyond matrix problems.
