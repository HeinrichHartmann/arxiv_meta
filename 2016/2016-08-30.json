Quantifying the effects of 'linked selection' on levels of genetic\ndiversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null\nmodel in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of\nnatural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers\nparameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection\nand selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations\nand genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a\nneutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and\nrecombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples\nusing composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of\ndistinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach\nyields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To\nillustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing\ndata from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity\nlevels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction\nof beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They\nallow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of\nselection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive\nsweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a\nsubstantial effect of linked selection from non-classic sweeps. More generally,\nwe demonstrate that linked selection has had a larger effect in reducing\ndiversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than\npreviously appreciated.\n"]}]

In this paper, we show, for a class of price processes which are\nnot necessarily semimartingales, the existence of an optimal trading strategy\nfor utility maximisation under transaction costs by establishing the existence\nof a so-called shadow price. This is a semimartingale price process, taking\nvalues in the bid ask spread, such that frictionless trading for that price\nprocess leads to the same optimal strategy and utility as the original problem\nunder transaction costs. Our results combine arguments from convex duality with\nthe stickiness condition introduced by P. Guasoni. They apply in particular to\nexponential utility and geometric fractional Brownian motion. In this case, the\nshadow price is an Ito process. As a consequence we obtain a rather surprising\nresult on the pathwise behaviour of fractional Brownian motion: the\ntrajectories may touch an Ito process in a one-sided manner without reflection.\n","Comment: To appear in Annals of Applied Probability.

The idea is to mix the\nvortex's internal gauge flux with an external flux using off-diagonal kinetic\nmixing. Such `dark' vortices could play a phenomenological role in models with\nboth cosmic strings and a dark gauge sector. When coupled to gravity they also\nprovide explicit ultra-violet completions for codimension-two brane-localized\nflux, which arises in extra-dimensional models when the same flux that\nstabilizes extra-dimensional size is also localized on space-filling branes\nsituated around the extra dimensions. We derive simple formulae for observables\nsuch as defect angle, tension, localized flux and on-vortex curvature when\ncoupled to gravity, and show how all of these are insensitive to much of the\nmicroscopic details of the solutions, and are instead largely dictated by\nlow-energy quantities. We derive the required effective description in terms of\na world-sheet brane action, and derive the matching conditions for its\ncouplings. We consider the case where the dimensions transverse to the bulk\ncompactify, and determine how the on- and off-vortex curvatures and other bulk\nfeatures depend on the vortex properties. We find that the brane-localized flux\ndoes not gravitate, but just renormalizes the tension in a magnetic-field\nindependent way. The existence of an explicit UV completion puts the effective\ndescription of these models on a more precise footing, verifying that\nbrane-localized flux can be consistent with sensible UV physics and resolving\nsome apparent paradoxes that can arise with a naive (but commonly used)\ndelta-function treatment of the brane's localization within the bulk.\n","Comment: 36 pages + appendices, 7 figures"]}]

Motivation, methodology\n  and first results from SALT"],"description":["  The black holes (BH) in merging BH-BH binaries are likely progeny of binary O\nstars. Their properties, including their spins, will be strongly influenced by\nthe evolution of their progenitor O stars. The remarkable observation that many\nsingle O stars spin very rapidly can be explained if they accreted angular\nmomentum from a mass-transferring, O-type or Wolf-Rayet companion before that\nstar blew up as a supernova. To test this prediction, we have measured the spin\nrates of eight O stars in Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O binaries, increasing the total\nsample size of such O stars' measured spins from two to ten. Polarimetric and\nother determinations of these systems' sin i allow us to determine an average\nequatorial rotation velocity from HeI (HeII) lines of $v_e$ = 348 (173) km/s\nfor these O stars, with individual star's $v_e$ from HeI (HeII) lines ranging\nfrom 482 (237) to 290 (91) km/s. We argue that the $\\sim$ 100\\% difference\nbetween HeI and HeII speeds is due to gravity darkening. Super-synchronous\nspins, now observed in all 10 O stars in WR + O binaries where it has been\nmeasured, are strong observational evidence that Roche lobe overflow mass\ntransfer from a WR progenitor companion has played a critical role in the\nevolution of WR+OB binaries. While theory predicts that this mass transfer\nrapidly spins-up the O-type mass gainer to a nearly break-up rotational\nvelocity $v_e \\sim 530 $ km/s, the observed average $v_e$ of the O-type stars\nin our sample is 65\\% that speed. This demonstrates that, even over the\nrelatively short WR-phase timescale, tidal and/or other effects causing\nrotational spin-down must be efficient. A challenge to tidal synchronization\ntheory is that the two longest-period binaries in our sample (with periods of\n29.7 and 78.5 days) unexpectedly display super-synchronous rotation.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

We present a preliminary analysis of the neutrino signal\npredicted by CITE and compare it to the neutrino burst of SN1987A. For strong\nCCSNe, as SN1987A, CITE predicts a proto-neutron star (PNS) accretion phase,\naccompanied by the corresponding neutrino luminosity, that can last a few\nseconds and that is cut-off abruptly by black hole (BH) formation. The neutrino\nluminosity can later be revived by accretion disc emission after a dead time of\nfew to a few ten seconds. In contrast, the neutrino mechanism for CCSNe\npredicts a shorter PNS accretion phase, followed by a slowly declining PNS\ncooling luminosity. We repeat statistical analyses used in the literature to\ninterpret the neutrino mechanism, and apply them to CITE. The first 1-2 sec of\nthe neutrino burst are equally compatible with CITE and with the neutrino\nmechanism. However, the data hints to a luminosity drop at t=2-3 sec, in some\ntension with the neutrino mechanism while being naturally attributed to BH\nformation in CITE. The occurrence of neutrino events at 5 sec in SN1987A\nsuggests that the accretion disc formed by that time. We perform 2D numerical\nsimulations, showing that CITE may be able to accommodate this disc formation\ntime while reproducing the ejected $^{56}$Ni mass and ejecta kinetic energy\nwithin factors 2-3 of observations. We estimate the disc neutrino luminosity\nand show that it can roughly match the data. This suggests that direct BH\nformation is compatible with the neutrino burst of SN1987A.

Intriguingly, our simulations show that the conformation Rsn-2\nadopts at an interface is an arrested state along the denaturation pathway.\nMore generally, our computational model should prove a useful, and\ncomputationally efficient, tool in studying the dynamics and energetics of\nprotein-interface interactions.\n","Comment: 8 figures"]}]

The latter has however some\ndrawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of\nBell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find\nthe experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation\nsuffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the\nBell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct\ninformation-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical\ncommunication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of\nmany instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per\ninstance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a\nconvex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number\nof measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental\nsetup.

We investigated a biophysical\nmodel of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription\nfactor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by\nbinding energy (-{\\Delta}G) and TF dosage. Transcription and gene expression\nproceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids, individuals may be\nheterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or at the TF's own\npromoter, which determines allele-specific dosage. We find that when the TF's\ncoding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for occupancy at the cis\nsites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion to the difference in\nbinding strength. When the TF's own promoter is heterozygous, the TF produced\nat the higher dosage is also dominant. Cis-site heterozygotes have additive\nexpression and therefore codominant phenotypes. Binding dominance propagates to\naffect the expression of downstream loci and it is sensitive in both magnitude\nand direction to genetic background, but its detectability often attenuates.\nWhile binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular level, it is difficult\nto detect in the phenotype under some biophysical conditions, more so when TF\ndosage is high and allele-specific binding affinities are similar.

The model of this problem begins with a medium\nconsisting of a calorically perfect gas with a prescribed energy release per\nunit mass. The energy release is collected into sheet-like sources that are now\nembedded in an inert gas that fills the spaces between them. The release of\nenergy in the first sheet results in a planar blast wave that propagates to the\nnext source, which is triggered after a prescribed delay, generating a new\nblast, and so forth. The resulting wave dynamics as the front passes through\nhundreds of such sources is computationally simulated by numerically solving\nthe governing one-dimensional Euler equations in the lab-fixed reference frame.\nThe average wave speed for each simulation is measured once the wave\npropagation has reached a quasi-periodic solution. Velocities in excess of the\nCJ speed are found as the sources are made increasingly discrete, with the\ndeviation above CJ being as great as $15\\%$. The total energy release, delay\ntime, and whether the sources remain lab-fixed or are convected with the flow\ndo not have a significant influence on the deviation of the average wave speed\naway from CJ. Such continuous waves can also be shown to have a time-averaged\nstructure consistent with the classical ZND structure of a detonation. In the\nlimit of highly discrete sources, temporal averaging of the wave structure\nshows that the effective sonic surface does not correspond to an equilibrium\nstate. The average state of the flow leaving the wave in this case does\neventually reach the equilibrium Hugoniot, but only after the effective sonic\nsurface has been crossed. Thus, the super-CJ waves observed in the limit of\nhighly discretized sources can be understood as weak detonations due to the\nnon-equilibrium state at the effective sonic surface.\n"]}]

This paper attempts to reconcile some apparently\ndifferent views emerged after the 2008 crisis regarding the nature and the\nrelevance of contagion in financial networks. We develop a common framework\nencompassing several network contagion models and show that, regardless of the\nshock distribution and the network topology, precise ordering relationships on\nthe level of aggregate systemic losses hold among models. We argue that the\nextent of contagion crucially depends on the amount of information that each\nmodel assumes to be available to market players. Under no uncertainty about the\nnetwork structure and values of external assets, the well-known Eisenberg and\nNoe (2001) model applies, which delivers the lowest level of contagion. This is\ndue to a property of loss conservation: aggregate losses after contagion are\nequal to the losses incurred by those institutions initially hit by a shock.\nThis property implies that many contagion analyses rule out by construction any\nloss amplification, treating de facto an interconnected system as a single\naggregate entity, where losses are simply mutualised. Under higher levels of\nuncertainty, as captured for instance by the DebtRank model, losses become\nnon-conservative and get compounded through the network. This has important\npolicy implications: by reducing the levels of uncertainty in times of distress\n(e.g. by obtaining specific data on the network) policymakers would be able to\nmove towards more conservative scenarios. Empirically, we compare the magnitude\nof contagion across models on a sample of the largest European banks during the\nyears 2006-2016.

The set of all locations of maximal rectangles is denoted\nby $\\mathcal{L}.$ We first explain how to determine all the $|\\mathcal{L}|$\nmaximal locations with their fingerprints in expected time $O(nm^2\\sigma)$\nusing a Monte Carlo algorithm (with polynomially small probability of error) or\nwithin deterministic $O(nm^2\\sigma\\log(\\frac{|\\mathcal{L}|}{nm^2}+2))$ time. We\nthen show how to build a data structure which occupies $O(nm\\log\nn+\\mathcal{|L|})$ space such that a query which asks for all the maximal\nlocations with a given fingerprint $f$ can be answered in time $O(|f|+\\log\\log\nn+k)$, where $k$ is the number of maximal locations with fingerprint $f$. If\nthe query asks only for the presence of the fingerprint, then the space usage\nbecomes $O(nm\\log n+|{\\cal F}|)$ while the query time becomes $O(|f|+\\log\\log\nn)$. We eventually consider the special case of squared regions (squares).\n","Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Sensing is usually cheaper than leasing, but the amount of\navailable spectrum obtained by sensing is uncertain due to the primary users'\nactivities in the licensed band.

The naive estimates for four of five time delay lenses\nshow surprising agreement with each other and with local measurements of H_0;\nthe complicated Q 0957+561 system is the only outlier. The agreement suggests\nthat it is reasonable to use simple isothermal lens models to infer H_0,\nalthough it is still important to check this conclusion by examining detailed\nmodels and by measuring more lensing time delays.\n","Comment: 16 pages with 2 embedded figures; submitted to ApJ"]}]

The brightest discrete X-ray source in the ROAST HRI\nobservations is invariably found to be positionally coincident with the optical\ngalactic nucleus, and in most cases its flux dominates the X-ray emission from\nthe central region of the galaxy. All seven galaxies have X-ray spectra\nconsistent with a two-component, soft thermal plus hard power-law, spectral\nform. If we exclude the two galaxies with relatively hard X-ray spectra, NGC\n3628 and NGC 4594, for which there is supporting evidence for a LLAGN (or\nalternatively in the case of NGC 3628 a dominant ultra-luminous X-ray binary),\nthen the remaining galaxies show surprisingly similar X-ray spectral\nproperties. Specifically the flux ratio F_x(0.5-1)/F_x(2-5), which measures the\nrelative strengths of the thermal and non-thermal emission components, shows\nlittle scatter about a mean of 0.66, a value very similar to that measured in\nthe classic starburst galaxy NGC 253. Since there is no obvious reason why the\nluminosity of the hard power-law continuum emanating from a putative LLAGN\nshould be very closely correlated with the thermal emission of the surrounding\nregion, this suggests that that the broad-band (0.5-5 keV) X-ray emission from\nthese LINER 2 galaxies may originate in a common set of processes probably\nassociated with the starburst phenomenon. Conversely, it appears that in many,\nperhaps the majority, of LINER 2 galaxies, the nuclear X-ray luminosity does\nnot derive directly from the presence of a LLAGN.\n","Comment: 10 pages (including 1 figure and 5 tables), 1 separate figure.

We\npresently examine the potential acceleration mechanisms in the magnetic\nreconnection site and find that first-order Fermi acceleration cannot provide\nsufficient efficiency (due to synchrotron losses). This leaves the one-shot\nacceleration via an induced electric field within the reconnection region as\nthe only viable process for UHECR acceleration. We formulate the constraints on\nboth the magnetic field topology and strength in order to accelerate the\nparticles and allow them to freely escape from the system.

We\npresent here new spectroscopy which shows that all four stars now exhibit\nstrong H-alpha emission, narrow CaII emission and a spectral type which is\nconsistent at all wavelengths.\n  We propose a scheme to understand these changes whereby the composite spectra\nof these stars can be explained by a period of active accretion onto the\ncentral, young star. In this scheme the composite spectrum consists of a\ncontribution from the stellar photosphere and a contribution from a hot,\noptically thick, accretion component. The optically thick nature of the\naccretion flow explains the weakness of the H-alpha emission during this phase.\nWithin this scheme, the change to a single spectral type at all wavelengths and\nemergence of strong H-alpha emission are consistent with the accretion columns\nbecoming optically thin, as the accretion rate drops. There is a strong analogy\nhere with the dwarf novae class of interacting binaries, which show similar\nbehaviour during the decline from outbursts of high mass-transfer rate.\n  The most important consequence of this interpretation is that these objects\nbring into question the association of Weak-Line T Tauri stars (WTTs) with\nnon-accreting or discless objects.

(2) High Order Balmer absorption\nlines of HI (HOBLs), on the other hand, are detected in 40% of LLAGN.\n  These features, which are strongest in 100 Myr--1 Gyr intermediate age\nstellar populations, are accompanied by diluted metal absorption lines and\nbluer colors than other objects in the sample.

We use realistic simulations with observed LFs to\ninvestigate the amplitude of the bias. We also compare our results to the\nglobal LFs derived from Hubble Deep Field-North and -South (HDF) surveys.

The effect is larger when the reference\nfilter in which the global LF is measured, is far from the rest-frame filter in\nwhich galaxies are selected. The fact that LF estimators are differently\naffected by this bias implies that the bias is minimal when the different LF\nestimators give measurements consistent with one another at the faint-end. For\ninstance, we show that the estimators are discrepant in the same way both in\nthe simulated and HDF LFs. This suggests that the HDF LFs are affected by the\npresently studied bias.

These\nflips substantially alter the dynamics of grain and limit the applicability of\nearlier theories that did not account for them. We also briefly review basic\nphysical processes involved in the alignment of grain angular momentum in\nrespect to interstellar magnetic field. We claim that the bulk of existing\nobservational data is consistent with the radiative torque alignment mechanism.\nIn particular, we show that large grains that are known to exist in the cores\nof molecular clouds may be aligned by the attenuated external interstellar\nradiation field.\n","Comment: 12 pages, Invited Review, Astrophysical Polarimetry 2004, Hawaii,\n  March 15-19, 2004"]}]

This technique is applied to\nstudy the geometry of nonradial pulsations in a prototype magnetic oscillating\n(roAp) star HR 3831. Our velocity map directly demonstrates an alignment of\npulsations with the axis of the global magnetic field and reveals a significant\nmagnetically induced distortion of pulsations. This observation constitutes a\nlong-sought solution of the problem of the pulsation geometry of roAp stars and\nenables very stringent tests of the recent theories of stellar magneto-acoustic\noscillations.\n","Comment: accepted by ApJ Letters"]}]

The radial velocities were derived from Keck/HIRES\nobservations. The model properly treats the orbital dynamics of the system, and\nthus yields robust and physically self-consistent solutions. Our set of system\nparameters agrees with previously published results though with improved\naccuracy. For example, applying robust limits on the stellar mass of\n0.93-1.20Msun, we find 1.26 < Rplanet < 1.42 Rjup and 0.59 < Mplanet < 0.70\nMjup. We can reduce the uncertainty on these estimates by including a stellar\nmass-radius relation constraint, yielding Rplanet = 1.35 +/- 0.07 Rjup and\nMplanet = 0.66 +/- 0.04 Mjup. Our results verify that the planetary radius is\n10-20% larger than predicted by planet evolution models, confirming the need\nfor an additional mechanism to slow the evolutionary contraction of the planet.\nA revised ephemeris is derived, T0=2452854.82545 + 3.52474554E (HJD), which now\ncontains an uncertainty in the period of 0.016s and should facilitate future\nsearches for planetary satellites and other bodies in the HD 209458 system.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 5 figures.

Here we present new\nintermediate-dispersion spectroscopy of this source which, combined with values\nreported in the literature, provides an orbital period of 3.90603+/-0.00017 d,\na mass function f(M)=0.0053+/-0.0009 M_sun, and an eccentricity e=0.35+/-0.04.\nAtmosphere model fitting to the spectrum of the optical companion, together\nwith our new distance estimate of d=2.5+/-0.1 kpc, yields R_opt=9.3+0.7-0.6\nR_sun, log (L_opt/L_sun)=5.26+/-0.06, and M_opt=22.9+3.4-2.9 M_sun. These,\ncombined with our dynamical solution and the assumption of\npseudo-synchronization, yield an inclination i=24.9+/-2.8 degree and a compact\nobject mass M_X=3.7+1.3-1.0 M_sun. This is above neutron star masses for most\nof the standard equations of state and, therefore, we propose that the compact\nobject in LS 5039 is a black hole. We finally discuss about the implications of\nour orbital solution and new parameters of the binary system on the CNO\nproducts, the accretion/ejection energetic balance, the SN explosion scenario,\nand the behaviour of the TeV emission with the new orbital period.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures.

It is particularly difficult to\nachieve a sub-arcsecond PSF on stacked images, where precise astrometry plays a\nkey role. Current astrometric standards are insufficient to achieve the science\ngoals of these facilities. We thus propose the establishing of a few selected\ndeep (V=25) astrometric standards (DAS).

The\ncolor distributions of individual GC systems are consistent with continuous\ntrends across galaxy luminosity, color, and stellar mass. On average, almost\nall galaxies possess a component of metal-poor GCs, with the average fraction\nof metal-rich GCs ranging from 15 to 60%. The colors of both subpopulations\ncorrelate with host galaxy luminosity and color, with the red GCs having a\nsteeper slope. To convert color to metallicity, we also introduce a preliminary\n(g-z)-[Fe/H] relation calibrated to Galactic, M49 and M87 GCs. This relation is\nnonlinear with a steeper slope for [Fe/H] < -0.8. As a result, the\nmetallicities of the metal-poor and metal-rich GCs vary similarly with respect\nto galaxy luminosity and stellar mass, with relations of [Fe/H]_MP ~ L^0.16 ~\nM_star^0.17 and [Fe/H]_MR ~ L^0.26 ~ M_star^0.22, respectively. Although these\nrelations are shallower than the mass-metallicity relation predicted by wind\nmodels and observed for dwarf galaxies, they are very similar to the\nmass-metallicity relation for star forming galaxies in the same mass range. The\noffset between the two GC populations varies slowly (~ M_star^0.05) and is\napproximately 1 dex across three orders of magnitude in mass, suggesting a\nnearly universal amount of enrichment between the formation of the two\npopulations of GCs. We also find that although the metal-rich GCs show a larger\ndispersion in color, it is the *metal-poor GCs* that have an equal or larger\ndispersion in metallicity. Like the color-magnitude relation, these relations\nderived from globular clusters present stringent constraints on the formation\nand evolution of early-type galaxies.

We report here data for the\ncluster of low-mass YSOs in the Serpens molecular core and for the single\nobject RNO~15-FIR. Towards Serpens SMM1, the most luminous sub-mm source of the\nSerpens cluster, the water maser emission comes from two small (< 5 AU in size)\nclusters of features separated by ~25 AU, having line of sight velocities\nstrongly red-shifted (by more than 10 km/s) with respect to the LSR velocity of\nthe molecular cloud. The two maser clusters are oriented on the sky along a\ndirection that is approximately perpendicular to the axis of the radio\ncontinuum jet observed with the VLA towards SMM1. The spatial and velocity\ndistribution of the maser features lead us to favor the interpretation that the\nmaser emission is excited by interaction of the receding lobe of the jet with\ndense gas in the accretion disk surrounding the YSO in SMM1. Towards\nRNO~15-FIR, the few detected maser features have both positions and (absolute)\nvelocities aligned along a direction that is parallel to the axis of the\nmolecular outflow observed on much larger angular scales. In this case the\nmaser emission likely emerges from dense, shocked molecular clumps displaced\nalong the axis of the jet emerging from the YSO. The protostar in Serpens SMM1\nis more massive than the one in RNO~15-FIR. We discuss the case where a high\nmass ejection rate can generate jets sufficiently powerful to sweep away from\ntheir course the densest portions of circumstellar gas.

Two main features\ncharacterize GAW with respect to all the existing and presently planned\nground-based Cherenkov telescopes. The first difference concerns the optics\nsystem: GAW uses a Fresnel refractive lens (2.13 m diameter) as light collector\ninstead of classical reflective mirror. The second main difference is the\ndetection working mode used: the detector at the focal surface operates in\nsingle photoelectron counting mode instead of the usual charge integration one.\nThe GAW array is planned to be located at the Calar Alto Observatory site,\nSpain, 2150 m a.s.l. During its first phase, only 6x6 degrees of the focal\nplane detector will be implemented; moving it along the field of view, the\nsensitivity of the telescopes will be tested observing the Crab Nebula with\non-axis and off-axis pointing up to 20 deg and with energy threshold of 300 GeV\nand energy peak of 700 GeV. As path-finder, GAW will also monitor the Very High\nEnergy activity of some flaring Blazars as well as will follow-up GLAST\ndetections at high energies. In a second phase, the focal plane will be\nenlarged to cover a field of view of 24 deg (full); pointing along different\nNorth-South directions, GAW would reach a survey of 360x60 degrees region of\nthe sky.

This wide wavelength coverage allows us to obtain\nreliable bolometric magnitudes. The properties of our sample are discussed with\nemphasis on about 70 stars with astrometric distances.

As for the dense phase of the ISM\nassociated with the star forming regions, the molecular clouds, we strongly\ndecrease the abundance of PAHs as compared to that in the cirrus, basing on the\nobservational evidences of the lack or weakness of PAH bands close to the newly\nformed stars, possibly due to the destruction of the molecules in strong UV\nfields. The robustness of the model is checked by fitting near infrared to\nradio broad band spectra and the corresponding detailed MIR spectra of a large\nsample of galaxies (Lu et al. 2003), at once. With this model, we have analyzed\nthe larger sample of actively star forming galaxies by Dale et al. (2000). We\nshow that the observed trends of galaxies in the ISO-IRAS-Radio color-color\nplots can be interpreted in terms of different evolutionary phases of star\nformation activity, and the consequent different dominance in the spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of the diffuse or dense phase of the ISM.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

As\npreviously found for 4U 1636-536, we show that the quality factor of the lower\nkilo-Hz increases with frequency up to a maximum frequency around 800 Hz,\nbeyond which an abrupt drop of its coherence is observed down to a limiting\nfrequency where the QPO disappears completely.

In this paper we address two issues: Are there processes of\ncollisionless collapse that can lead to equilibria of the exceptional type?\nWhat is the intrinsic structural property that is responsible for the sometimes\nnoted exceptional stability behavior? To clarify these issues, we have\nperformed a series of simulations of collisionless collapse that start from\nhomogeneous, highly symmetrized, cold initial conditions and, because of such\nspecial conditions, are characterized by very little mixing. For these runs,\nthe end-states can be associated with large values of the global pressure\nanisotropy parameter up to 2K_r/K_T \\approx 2.75. The highly anisotropic\nequilibrium states thus constructed show no significant traces of radial\nanisotropy in their central region, with a very sharp transition to a radially\nanisotropic envelope occurring well inside the half-mass radius (around 0.2\nr_M). To check whether the existence of such almost perfectly isotropic\n\"nucleus\" might be responsible for the apparent suppression of the radial orbit\ninstability, we could not resort to equilibrium models with the above\ncharacteristics and with analytically available distribution function; instead,\nwe studied and confirmed the stability of configurations with those\ncharacteristics by initializing N-body approximate equilibria (with given\ndensity and pressure anisotropy profiles) with the help of the Jeans equations.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical\n  Journal"]}]

Outbursts in systems of this type occur when\nthe accretion rate exceeds the upper limit of the steady burning range.\nTherefore, in order to realize the transition from a quiescent to an active\nstate it is necessary to find a mechanism able to sufficiently increase the\naccretion rate on a time scale typical to the duration of outburst development.\n  Our calculations have confirmed the transition mechanism from quiescence to\noutburst in classic symbiotic systems suggested earlier on the basis of 2D\ncalculations (Bisikalo et al, 2002). The analysis of our results have shown\nthat for wind velocity of 20 km/s an accretion disc forms in the system. The\naccretion rate for the solution with the disc is ~22.5-25% of the mass loss\nrate of the donor, that is, ~4.5-5*10^(-8)Msun/yr for Z And. This value is in\nagreement with the steady burning range for white dwarf masses typically\naccepted for this system. When the wind velocity increases from 20 to 30 km/s\nthe accretion disc is destroyed and the matter of the disc falls onto the\naccretor's surface. This process is followed by an approximately twofold\naccretion rate jump. The resulting accretion rate growth is sufficient for\npassing the upper limit of the steady burning range, thereby bringing the\nsystem into an active state. The time during which the accretion rate is above\nthe steady burning value is in a very good agreement with observations.\n  The analysis of the results presented here allows us to conclude that small\nvariations in the donor's wind velocity can lead to the transition from the\ndisc accretion to the wind accretion and, as a consequence, to the transition\nfrom quiescent to active state in classic symbiotic stars.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 7 figures"]}]

In order to populate the 0.3-1 kpc size range (large CSOs) and also\nin order to find more flat-spectrum MSOs, we have built a sample of 157 radio\nsources with a_{1.40}^{4.85}<0.5 that were resolved with the VLA-A 8.4 GHz. As\nfirst results, we have 'rediscovered' nine of the known CSO/MSOs while\nidentifying two new ~14 kpc MSOs and two candidate CSO/MSOs (which only lack\nredshifts for final classification). We were able to reject 61 of the remaining\n144 objects from literature information alone. In the series of papers that\nstarts with this one we plan to classify the remaining 83 CSO/MSO candidates\n(thanks to radio and optical observations) as well as characterize the physical\nproperties of the (likely) many 0.3-15 kpc flat-spectrum CSO/MSOs to be found.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables (note that Table 2, in landscape\n  format, has a separate file); accepted by MNRAS"]}]

The fraction of gas in\nmolecular form increases with increasing FIR luminosity but does not show any\nobvious trend with other galaxy properties. (2) the $H2$ surface density (s.d.)\nis better correlated with the cold dust s.d. than the HI s.d., but the\ncorrelation of HI with dust is not negligible. Globally in these galaxies the\ncold dust emission is associated with both the molecular and atomic phases. (3)\nthe FIR surface brightness increases as the third power of the S60um/S100um\nratio, it shows a tight correlation with both the H$_2$ and dust surface\ndensities and a weaker one with the HI surface density: a large part of the\nfar-infrared emission of these galaxies originates in the molecular medium. (4)\nthe gas-to-dust ratio ranges between 100 and 1000 and its average value is 230,\nclose to the Galactic value. There is indeed a clear trend: this ratio\ndecreases as the FIR surface density increases, a result which can be explained\nin the framework of an enhancement of metallicity in galaxy discs having a\nhigher star formation rate.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 tables, uuencode tar compress file including 6 figures"]}]

To isolate the various physical\naffects included in the new rotation plus diffusion models we also constructed\nsolar models to test the significance of diffusion and of overshoot by\nthemselves. In previous studies, models that include helium diffusion during\nsolar evolution were found to improve the predicted p-mode frequencies for some\nmodes and worsen the agreement for others (Guenther \\ea 1993). Here we verify\nthis result for both the Bahcall and Loeb (1990) formulation of diffusion and\nthe Proffitt and Michaud (1991) formulation of diffusion.

In the thin overshoot layer (taken here to be $0.1\\,\nH_p$), we have compared the effect of overmixing in a radiative layer versus\nconvective (adiabatic) penetration. Neither radiative overmixing nor adiabatic\npenetration has any significant effect on the $p$-modes, probably in part\nbecause the overshoot layer is constrained to be thin.

As the orbit of a satellite decays through\ndynamical friction, the primary disk develops large-amplitude spirals in\nresponse to its tidal forcing. While these features arise in both the stars and\nthe gas in the disk, the non--axisymmetric structures in the gas differ\nslightly from those in the stars. In particular, as a consequence of the\nformation of strong shocks in the gas and the effects of radiative cooling, the\ngas response tends to lead the stellar response, enabling the stars to strongly\ntorque the gas. These torques deprive the gas of its angular momentum, forcing\na significant fraction of it into the inner regions of the disk. The radial\ninflows induced by these mergers accumulate large quantities of interstellar\ngas in the nuclear regions of the host disks. In some cases, nearly half of all\nthe gas initially distributed throughout the disk winds up in a dense ``cloud''\nseveral hundred parsecs in extent. The models reported here do not include star\nformation and, so, we cannot determine the ultimate fate of the gas.\nNevertheless, given the high densities in the nuclear gas, it is plausible to\nidentify these concentrations of dense gas in the remnants with those\naccompanying intense starbursts in some active galaxies. Therefore, the\ncalculations here provide a framework for interpreting the origin of nuclear\nactivity in otherwise quiescent disk galaxies. To the extent that galaxy\nformation is a chaotic process in which large structures are built up by the\naccretion of smaller fragments, our models may also be relevant to starbursts\nand the onset of nuclear activity in proto--galaxies at high redshifts.\n","Comment: 28 pages of LaTeX, using the AASTEX macros.

Firstly, black holes are generally\n``seen'' only in binaries, by the accretion of matter from a companion star.\nHigh mass black holes are capable of accreting more matter than low-mass black\nholes, so there is a selection effect favoring them. This, in itself, would not\nbe sufficient to show why low-mass black holes have not been seen, since\nneutron stars (of nearly the same mass) are seen in abundance.\n  Secondly, and this is our main point, the primary star in a binary ---the\nfirst star to evolve--- loses its hydrogen envelope by transfer of matter to\nthe secondary and loss into space, and the resulting ``naked'' helium star\nevolves differently than a helium core, which is at least initially covered by\nthe hydrogen envelope in a massive main-sequence star.

The symmetric X-ray\nemission from A2626 suggests a relaxed, single-component system; however, 159\nredshifts reveals a complex, three component cluster at cz~17,500km/s. One\ncomponents is a typical X-ray bright cluster, a second has a cluster-like\ngalaxy population with lower central galaxy and gas density, and the third is a\nbackground structure with field galaxy composition. A comparison of the\nmagnitude distributions within the two subclusters suggests that A2626 is a\nmerger in progress. Virial masses and a composite luminosity function for a\nregion with projected radius r=1.5h^{-1}Mpc yield a mass to light ratio\nM/L_R~610h. Analysis of the X-ray emission from the primary component yields a\ngas mass fraction of 2.2h^{-3/2}% and a baryon fraction of 3.4%. A radial\ninfall model implies that the virial mass may be an underestimate. In A2440,\ndeep CCD $R$ band photometry indicates a striking correspondence between the\ngalaxy and gas distributions. The galaxy distribution has three main\ncomponents, each associated with a giant elliptical galaxy. The two larger\npeaks in the galaxy distribution coincide with the primary peaks in the X-ray\nemission, and the third is associated with a significant X-ray surface\nbrightness enhancement. We use this galaxy-gas correspondence and 48 redshifts\nto argue that the subclusters are bound within a single system, and that the\ntwo primary components are beginning to merge.

They enter through one side of the\ndisk, proceed horizontally a distance $ l $ in the disk, and then leave through\nthe other side. We find that the lines of force are stretched rotation of the\ngalactic disk, which amplifies the toroidal component of the field and\nincreases$l $. When the magnetic field is strong enough, it produces ambipolar\nvelocities that try to lift the line out of the galactic disk but in opposite\ndirections ondifferent parts of the line. The result is, instead of the line\nbeing expelled from the disk, its horizontal length $l $ is shortened, both in\nthe radial, and in the toroidal direction. This leads to a reduction of the\nrate of horizontal stretching, and, finally, a reduction in the magnetic field\nstrength. After a sufficient time, the magnetic field at all points goes\nthrough this stretching and reduction, and the field strength approaches a\nuniversal function of time. This function is slowly decreasing, and only\ndepends on the ambipolar propertiesof the interstellar medium.

We compare these results to those recently\nobtained on other BHCs, and conclude that this ``intermediate state'' behavior\nis a common characteristic of BHCs, that occurs at $\\dot M$ levels intermediate\nbetween the high and the low state. We argue that this result can be used to\nresolve the long-standing issue of the dependence of the power spectral break\nfrequency in the low state on mass accretion rate, and strengthens the idea\nthat low-state noise and very-high state noise may have a common origin. We\nbriefly discuss a possible interpretation for the changes in break frequency in\nthe low state and between low state and intermediate state.\n","Comment: To appear in ApJ.

(2) The flux in the HeI continuum is increased due to\nnon-LTE effects.

(3) The flux\nin the Lyman continuum is also modified due to line blanketing and the presence\nof a stellar winds, although to a lesser degree than the spectrum at higher\nenergies.

Due to the increased flux in the HeI continuum the hardness ratio\nof the HeI to H continuum is increased by 1.6 to 2.5 depending on spectral type\nand luminosity class.

The usual\nstatistical methods, that are based on the assumption of homogeneity, are\ntherefore inconsistent for all the length scales probed until now. A new, more\ngeneral, conceptual framework is necessary to identify the real physical\nproperties of these structures. In the range of self-similarity theories should\nshift from \"amplitudes\" to \"exponents\". The new analysis shows that all the\navailable data are consistent with each other and show fractal correlations\n(with dimension $D \\simeq 2$) up to the deepest scales probed until now ($1000\nh^{-1}Mpc$) and even more as indicated from the new interpretation of the\nnumber counts. The distribution of luminous matter in the universe is therefore\nfractal and not homogeneous. The evidence for this being very strong up to $150\nh^{-1}Mpc$ due to the statistical roboustness of the data and progressively\nweaker (statistically) at larger distances due to the limited data. These facts\nlead to fascinating conceptual implications about our knowledge of the universe\nand to a new scenario for the theoretical challenge in this field.\n","Comment: 26 pages, latex including 7 figures (Revised version: shorter\n  abstract).

In general, the MBGs have lower far-infrared\nluminosities ($L_{IR} < 10^{11} L_{\\odot}$) and are nearer (z < 0.05) than the\nluminous IRAS galaxies.\n  The distribution of the morphologies of the MBGs indicates a high number of\nearly-type spirals (Sb and earlier). Nearly half of these galaxies also possess\na bar. In our sample, the fraction of galaxies with bars depends on the\nmorphology and increases towards the late-type spirals. However, if we consider\nonly isolated galaxies, the late-type spirals show a clear tendency to be\nbarred. Signs of a recent interaction with neighbor galaxies are obvious only\nin 24% of our candidates. Although this number is only a lower limit, it is\nnevertheless sufficiently low to suggest that in a majority of massive galaxies\nthe burst of star formation do not depends solely on dynamical processes.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 Latex tables and 6 Postscript figures, uses aasms4.sty,\n  accepted for publication in the Astronomical journal"]}]

In the first range of scale, below $100 \\div 200 \\hmp$, the\nstatistical quality of the data is rather good, and we find that galaxy\ndistribution has fractal properties with $D \\approx2$.\n  At larger distances the statistical robustness of the present data is weaker,\nbut, we show that there is evidence for a continuation of the fractal behavior,\nwithout any tendency towards homogenization.\n","Comment: 22 pages, latex, 5 postscirpt figures, sub,itted to New Astronomy,\n  also available at http://www.phys.uniroma1.it/DOCS/PIL/pil.html"]}]

The main properties of the X-ray\nemission can all be explained as being due to shock-heating driven as the\nsuperwind encounters a massive ionized cloud in the halo of M82. This encounter\ndrives a slow shock into the cloud, which contributes to the excitation of the\nobserved H-alpha emission. At the same time, a fast bow-shock develops in the\nsuperwind just upstream of the cloud, and this produces the observed X-ray\nemission.

At variance with\nprevious claims we find that these stars experience thermal instability (the so\ncalled thermal pulses). The critical quantity which controls the onset of a\nthermally pulsing phase is the amount of CNO in the envelope during the AGB.\nFor these stars the central He burning starts in the blue side of the HR\ndiagram and the 1^{st} dredge up does not take place. Then the envelope\nmaintains its initial composition up to the beginning of the AGB phase.\nHowever, during the early AGB the 2^{nd} dredge-up occurs and fresh He and CNO\nelements are engulfed in the convective envelope. We find that in stars with\nM.ge.6Mo the resulting amount of ^{12}C is large enough to sustain a normal CNO\nburning within the H shell and consequently the star enters the usual thermal\npulse phase. In the 5Mo model, owing to the lower ^{12}C enhancement in the\nenvelope after the 2^{nd} dredge-up, the He burning shell suffers weak thermal\ninstabilities. 9 of these thermal oscillation are needed before the He burning\nluminosity reaches 3x10^5 Lo and a first convective shell develops in between\nthe two burning shells.
