This problem of identification of\na small set of active subspaces among a huge collection of subspaces from a\nsingle (noisy) observation in the ambient space is termed subspace unmixing.\nThis paper formally poses the subspace unmixing problem under the parsimonious\nsubspace-sum (PS3) model, discusses connections of the PS3 model to problems in\nwireless communications, hyperspectral imaging, high-dimensional statistics and\ncompressed sensing, and proposes a low-complexity algorithm, termed marginal\nsubspace detection (MSD), for subspace unmixing.

When the training dataset consists of private information, it\nis natural to use a differentially private ERM algorithm, and this problem has\nbeen the subject of a long line of work started with Chaudhuri and Monteleoni\n2008. A private ERM algorithm outputs an approximate minimizer of the loss\nfunction and its error can be measured as the difference from the optimal value\nof the loss function. When the constraint set is arbitrary, the required error\nbounds are fairly well understood \\cite{BassilyST14}. In this work, we show\nthat the geometric properties of the constraint set can be used to derive\nsignificantly better results. Specifically, we show that a differentially\nprivate version of Mirror Descent leads to error bounds of the form\n$\\tilde{O}(G_{\\mathcal{C}}/n)$ for a lipschitz loss function, improving on the\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{p}/n)$ bounds in Bassily, Smith and Thakurta 2014.

We verify this prediction by determining the lattices\nof electric and magnetic charges in all relevant examples. We also calculate\ncertain BPS-saturated couplings and verify that they are invariant under the\nFricke S-duality. For CHL models that are not self-dual, the strong coupling\nlimit is dual to type IIA compactified on T^6/Z_N, for some Z_N-symmetry\npreserving half of the spacetime supersymmetries.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 3 figures; v3: some minor mistakes corrected"]}]

We quantify the level of concordance between the\nCFHTLenS and Planck datasets by employing two distinct data concordance tests,\ngrounded in Bayesian evidence and information theory. We find that the two data\nconcordance tests largely agree with one another, and that the level of\nconcordance between the CFHTLenS and Planck datasets is sensitive to the exact\ndetails of the systematic uncertainties included in our analysis, ranging from\ndecisive discordance to substantial concordance as the treatment of the\nsystematic uncertainties becomes more conservative. The least conservative\nscenario is the one most favored by the cosmic shear data, but it is also the\none that shows the greatest degree of discordance with Planck.

In this paper, we introduce MCMC\nalgorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way to\ncompensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework is\nbased on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows to express the BP error\nas a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is\ncomputationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing up\nall 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise\nbinary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically.\nMotivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme\nfor the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Our\nmain idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing in\nother (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme to\nsample 2-regular loops.

In the first regime the strain rate quickly\nattains a value prescribed by the fluid's underlying homogeneous constitutive\ncurve, at the given stress. In this first regime, no appreciable necking\narises. A second regime then ensues in which the homogeneous flow destabilises\nto form a neck. This necking instability can occur via two distinct modes. The\nfirst mode is relatively gentle and arises in any regime where the slope of the\nconstitutive curve is positive. It has a rate of necking per accumulated strain\nunit set by the inverse of the slope of the constitutive curve.

Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a\ndistinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.\nWe demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural\noutcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical\nsignificance, but that the quiescent population requires additional\nastrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution\nbased on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local\ngalaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the\nevolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the\ndepletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The\nquiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas\nhas fallen below a threshold for disk stability. The evolution of galaxies\nbeyond the quiescent state to gas exhaustion requires another process, probably\nwind-driven mass loss. The SSFR distribution of the quiescent and passive\nimplies that the timescale of this process must be greater than a few Gyrs but\nless than a few tens of Gyrs. The environmental dependence of the galaxy\npopulations is consistent with recent theory suggesting that cold gas inflows\ninto galaxies are truncated at earlier times in denser environments.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 21 figures, submitted to ApJ Figure 3 replaced with correct\n  file"]}]

We investigate\nthe rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo\nsimulations under the hypothesis of disk locking and stellar angular momentum\nconservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0.01\nMo to 0.4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial\nperiod distributions with and without disk locking. An object is considered to\nbe diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results.\nModels with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the\nobservations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a\ncorrelation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking\nhypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results.\nThe angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for\nstars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less\nmassive than 0.2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases\nwith decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the\navailable observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in\nthe low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is\ndifferent from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.\n","Comment: 14 pages, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

In general, it is hard to design a tracking\nmodel suitable for all object categories, e.g., a rigid tracker for a car is\nnot suitable for a deformable gymnast. Category-based trackers usually achieve\nsuperior tracking performance for the objects of that specific category, but\nhave difficulties being generalised. Therefore, we propose a novel unified\nrobust tracking framework which explicitly encodes both generic features and\ncategory-based features. The tracker consists of a shared convolutional network\n(NetS), which feeds into two parallel networks, NetC for classification and\nNetT for tracking. NetS is pre-trained on ImageNet to serve as a generic\nfeature extractor across the different object categories for NetC and NetT.\nNetC utilises those features within fully connected layers to classify the\nobject category. NetT has multiple branches, corresponding to multiple\ncategories, to distinguish the tracked object from the background. Since each\nbranch in NetT is trained by the videos of a specific category or groups of\nsimilar categories, NetT encodes category-based features for tracking. During\nonline tracking, NetC and NetT jointly determine the target regions with the\nright category and foreground labels for target estimation. To improve the\nrobustness and precision, NetC and NetT inter-supervise each other and trigger\nnetwork adaptation when their outputs are ambiguous for the same image regions\n(i.e., when the category label contradicts the foreground/background\nclassification).

A combination FI-N-FI sandwiched\nbetween two superconductors can be used to create and analyze such\nspin-polarized quasiparticles through their nonequilibrium accumulation in the\nmiddle metallic (N) layer. We report spin-polarized quasiparticle regulation in\na double spin-filter tunnel junction in the configuration NbN-GdN1-Ti-GdN2-NbN.\nThe middle Ti layer provides magnetic decoupling between two ferromagnetic GdN\nand a place for nonequilibrium quasiparticle accumulation. The two GdN(1,2)\nlayers were deposited under different conditions to introduce coercive\ncontrast. The quasiparticle tunneling spectra has been measured at different\ntemperatures to understand the tunneling mechanism in these double spin-filter\njunctions. The conductance spectra were found to be comparable to an asymmetric\nSINI'S-type tunnel junction. A hysteretic R-H loop with higher resistance for\nthe antiparallel configuration compared to parallel state was observed\nasserting the spin-polarized nature of quasiparticles. The hysteresis in the\nR-H loop was found to disappear for sub-gap bias current.

This formulation captures many situations in which\nit is unrealistic to assume a global view, and also exposes interesting\nphenomena in the original problem.\n  Specifically, we say an allocation is locally envy-free if no agent envies a\nneighbor's allocation and locally proportional if each agent values her own\nallocation as much as the average value of her neighbor's allocations, with the\nformer implying the latter. While global envy-freeness implies local\nenvy-freeness, global proportionality does not imply local proportionality, or\nvice versa. A general result is that for any two distinct graphs on the same\nset of nodes and an allocation, there exists a set of valuation functions such\nthat the allocation is locally proportional on one but not the other.\n  We fully characterize the set of graphs for which an oblivious single-cutter\nprotocol-- a protocol that uses a single agent to cut the cake into pieces\n--admits a bounded protocol with $O(n^2)$ query complexity for locally\nenvy-free allocations in the Robertson-Webb model.

However, most face datasets accessible for training and\nverification are only collected in the VIS (visible light) spectrum. It remains\na challenging problem to match NIR to VIS face images due to the different\nlight spectrum. Recently, breakthroughs have been made for VIS face recognition\nby applying deep learning on a huge amount of labeled VIS face samples. The\nsame deep learning approach cannot be simply applied to NIR face recognition\nfor two main reasons: First, much limited NIR face images are available for\ntraining compared to the VIS spectrum. Second, face galleries to be matched are\nmostly available only in the VIS spectrum. In this paper, we propose an\napproach to extend the deep learning breakthrough for VIS face recognition to\nthe NIR spectrum, without retraining the underlying deep models that see only\nVIS faces. Our approach consists of two core components, cross-spectral\nhallucination and low-rank embedding, to optimize respectively input and output\nof a VIS deep model for cross-spectral face recognition. Cross-spectral\nhallucination produces VIS faces from NIR images through a deep learning\napproach. Low-rank embedding restores a low-rank structure for faces deep\nfeatures across both NIR and VIS spectrum. We observe that it is often equally\neffective to perform hallucination to input NIR images or low-rank embedding to\noutput deep features for a VIS deep model for cross-spectral recognition. When\nhallucination and low-rank embedding are deployed together, we observe\nsignificant further improvement; we obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the\nCASIA NIR-VIS v2.0 benchmark, without the need at all to re-train the\nrecognition system.\n"]}]

Then most existing models\nusually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-based\noperation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector.\nHowever, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutually\nindependent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-step\ndimension independently may destroy the structure of the feature\nrepresentation.

The problem can be\neasily solved in time $O^*(2^k)$, making it fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)\nwith respect to $k$. While the fastest known algorithm takes only time\n$O^*(1.2738^k)$, much stronger improvements have been obtained by studying\nparameters that are smaller than $k$. Apart from treewidth-related results, the\narguably best algorithm for Vertex Cover runs in time $O^*(2.3146^p)$, where\n$p=k-LP(G)$ is only the excess of the solution size $k$ over the best\nfractional vertex cover (Lokshtanov et al.\\ TALG 2014). Since $p\\leq k$ but $k$\ncannot be bounded in terms of $p$ alone, this strictly increases the range of\ntractable instances.\n  Recently, Garg and Philip (SODA 2016) greatly contributed to understanding\nthe parameterized complexity of the Vertex Cover problem. They prove that\n$2LP(G)-MM(G)$ is a lower bound for the vertex cover size of $G$, where $MM(G)$\nis the size of a largest matching of $G$, and proceed to study parameter\n$\\ell=k-(2LP(G)-MM(G))$. They give an algorithm of running time $O^*(3^\\ell)$,\nproving that Vertex Cover is FPT in $\\ell$. It can be easily observed that\n$\\ell\\leq p$ whereas $p$ cannot be bounded in terms of $\\ell$ alone. We\ncomplement the work of Garg and Philip by proving that Vertex Cover admits a\nrandomized polynomial kernelization in terms of $\\ell$, i.e., an efficient\npreprocessing to size polynomial in $\\ell$.

Except the active neutrinos, the appearance of\nsingly charged Higgs bosons and dark matters does not affect significantly the\nphysical spectrum of all particles in the original model. We indicate this\npoint by investigating the Higgs sector in both cases before and after singly\ncharged scalars are added into it.

Assuming the same\ngalaxy cluster parameter priors and adding a prior on the Hubble constant we\ncan achieve tight constraints on the CPL parametrization of the dark energy\nequation of state parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$ with just 100 clusters:\n$\\sigma_{w_0} = 0.10$ and $\\sigma_{w_a} = 0.93$. Dropping the assumption of\nflatness and assuming $w=-1$ we also attain competitive constraints on the\nmatter and dark energy density parameters: $\\sigma_{\\Omega_M} = 0.072$ and\n$\\sigma_{\\Omega_{\\Lambda}} = 0.114$ for 100 clusters uniformly distributed\nbetween $ 0 \\leq z \\leq 0.6$. We also discuss various observational strategies\nfor tightening constraints in both the near and far future.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures, submitted to PRD.

We define the notion of a sparse reduction that\npreserves graph sparsity, and we present several such reductions for graph\nproblems in the $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ class.

We show that if the Strong Exponential Time\nHypothesis (SETH) holds, then several problems in the $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ class,\nincluding certain problems that are also in the sub-cubic equivalence class\ncannot have `sub-$mn$' time algorithms, i.e., algorithms that run in\n$O(m^{\\alpha} \\cdot n^{2-\\alpha -\\epsilon})$ time, for constants $\\alpha \\geq\n0$, $\\epsilon > 0$. In particular, this result means that under SETH, the\nsub-cubic equivalence class is split into at least two classes when sparsity is\ntaken into account, with triangle finding problems having faster algorithms\nthan Eccentricities or Betweenness Centrality. This hardness result for the\n$\\tilde{O}(mn)$ class is also surprising because a similar hardness result for\nthe sub-cubic class is considered unlikely since this would falsify NSETH\n(Nondeterministic SETH).\n"]}]
