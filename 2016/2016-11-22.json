This problem of identification of\na small set of active subspaces among a huge collection of subspaces from a\nsingle (noisy) observation in the ambient space is termed subspace unmixing.\nThis paper formally poses the subspace unmixing problem under the parsimonious\nsubspace-sum (PS3) model, discusses connections of the PS3 model to problems in\nwireless communications, hyperspectral imaging, high-dimensional statistics and\ncompressed sensing, and proposes a low-complexity algorithm, termed marginal\nsubspace detection (MSD), for subspace unmixing.

When the training dataset consists of private information, it\nis natural to use a differentially private ERM algorithm, and this problem has\nbeen the subject of a long line of work started with Chaudhuri and Monteleoni\n2008. A private ERM algorithm outputs an approximate minimizer of the loss\nfunction and its error can be measured as the difference from the optimal value\nof the loss function. When the constraint set is arbitrary, the required error\nbounds are fairly well understood \\cite{BassilyST14}. In this work, we show\nthat the geometric properties of the constraint set can be used to derive\nsignificantly better results. Specifically, we show that a differentially\nprivate version of Mirror Descent leads to error bounds of the form\n$\\tilde{O}(G_{\\mathcal{C}}/n)$ for a lipschitz loss function, improving on the\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{p}/n)$ bounds in Bassily, Smith and Thakurta 2014.

We verify this prediction by determining the lattices\nof electric and magnetic charges in all relevant examples. We also calculate\ncertain BPS-saturated couplings and verify that they are invariant under the\nFricke S-duality. For CHL models that are not self-dual, the strong coupling\nlimit is dual to type IIA compactified on T^6/Z_N, for some Z_N-symmetry\npreserving half of the spacetime supersymmetries.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 3 figures; v3: some minor mistakes corrected"]}]

We quantify the level of concordance between the\nCFHTLenS and Planck datasets by employing two distinct data concordance tests,\ngrounded in Bayesian evidence and information theory. We find that the two data\nconcordance tests largely agree with one another, and that the level of\nconcordance between the CFHTLenS and Planck datasets is sensitive to the exact\ndetails of the systematic uncertainties included in our analysis, ranging from\ndecisive discordance to substantial concordance as the treatment of the\nsystematic uncertainties becomes more conservative. The least conservative\nscenario is the one most favored by the cosmic shear data, but it is also the\none that shows the greatest degree of discordance with Planck.

In this paper, we introduce MCMC\nalgorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way to\ncompensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework is\nbased on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows to express the BP error\nas a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is\ncomputationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing up\nall 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise\nbinary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically.\nMotivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme\nfor the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Our\nmain idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing in\nother (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme to\nsample 2-regular loops.

In the first regime the strain rate quickly\nattains a value prescribed by the fluid's underlying homogeneous constitutive\ncurve, at the given stress. In this first regime, no appreciable necking\narises. A second regime then ensues in which the homogeneous flow destabilises\nto form a neck. This necking instability can occur via two distinct modes. The\nfirst mode is relatively gentle and arises in any regime where the slope of the\nconstitutive curve is positive. It has a rate of necking per accumulated strain\nunit set by the inverse of the slope of the constitutive curve.

While the private uncertainty source refers to uncertain\nthermal energy demand of individual buildings, the common uncertainty source\ndescribes the uncertain common resource pool (ATES) between neighbors.

Several lines of evidence suggest that these quiescent galaxies form a\ndistinct population rather than a low star formation tail of the main sequence.\nWe demonstrate that a tight main sequence, evolving with epoch, is a natural\noutcome of most histories of star formation and has little astrophysical\nsignificance, but that the quiescent population requires additional\nastrophysics to explain its properties. Using a simple model for disk evolution\nbased on the observed dependence of star formation on gas content in local\ngalaxies, and assuming simple histories of cold gas inflow, we show that the\nevolution of galaxies away from the main sequence can be attributed to the\ndepletion of gas due to star formation after a cutoff in gas inflow. The\nquiescent population is composed of galaxies in which the density of disk gas\nhas fallen below a threshold for disk stability. The evolution of galaxies\nbeyond the quiescent state to gas exhaustion requires another process, probably\nwind-driven mass loss. The SSFR distribution of the quiescent and passive\nimplies that the timescale of this process must be greater than a few Gyrs but\nless than a few tens of Gyrs. The environmental dependence of the galaxy\npopulations is consistent with recent theory suggesting that cold gas inflows\ninto galaxies are truncated at earlier times in denser environments.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 21 figures, submitted to ApJ Figure 3 replaced with correct\n  file"]}]

Very low-mass (VLM) stars and brown dwarfs (BDs) present a different\nrotational behaviour from their solar mass counter-parts. Aims. We investigate\nthe rotational evolution of young VLM stars and BDs using Monte Carlo\nsimulations under the hypothesis of disk locking and stellar angular momentum\nconservation. Methods. We built a set of objects with masses ranging from 0.01\nMo to 0.4 Mo and considered models with single- and double- peaked initial\nperiod distributions with and without disk locking. An object is considered to\nbe diskless when its mass accretion rate is below a given threshold. Results.\nModels with initial single-peaked period distributions reproduce the\nobservations well given that BDs rotate faster than VLM stars. We observe a\ncorrelation between rotational period and mass when we relax the disk locking\nhypothesis, but with a shallower slope compared to some observational results.\nThe angular momentum evolution of diskless stars is flatter than it is for\nstars with a disk which occurs because the moment of inertia of objects less\nmassive than 0.2 Mo remains pratically constant for a time scale that increases\nwith decreasing stellar mass. Conclusions. Comparing our results with the\navailable observational data we see that disk locking is not as important in\nthe low-mass regime and that the rotational behaviour of VLM stars and BDs is\ndifferent from what is seen in their solar mass counterparts.\n","Comment: 14 pages, accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

In general, it is hard to design a tracking\nmodel suitable for all object categories, e.g., a rigid tracker for a car is\nnot suitable for a deformable gymnast. Category-based trackers usually achieve\nsuperior tracking performance for the objects of that specific category, but\nhave difficulties being generalised. Therefore, we propose a novel unified\nrobust tracking framework which explicitly encodes both generic features and\ncategory-based features. The tracker consists of a shared convolutional network\n(NetS), which feeds into two parallel networks, NetC for classification and\nNetT for tracking. NetS is pre-trained on ImageNet to serve as a generic\nfeature extractor across the different object categories for NetC and NetT.\nNetC utilises those features within fully connected layers to classify the\nobject category. NetT has multiple branches, corresponding to multiple\ncategories, to distinguish the tracked object from the background. Since each\nbranch in NetT is trained by the videos of a specific category or groups of\nsimilar categories, NetT encodes category-based features for tracking. During\nonline tracking, NetC and NetT jointly determine the target regions with the\nright category and foreground labels for target estimation. To improve the\nrobustness and precision, NetC and NetT inter-supervise each other and trigger\nnetwork adaptation when their outputs are ambiguous for the same image regions\n(i.e., when the category label contradicts the foreground/background\nclassification).

With silicon nanobrick arrays of spatially varying\norientations sitting on both side of a transparent substrate, this ultrathin\nzoom metalens can be designed to focus an incident circular polarized beam with\nspin-dependent FOVs without varying the focal plane, which is important for\npractical applications. The proposed dual FOV zoom metalens, with the\nadvantages such as ultracompactness, flexibility and replicability, can find\napplications in fields which require ultracompact zoom imaging and beam\nfocusing.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

But, on the other hand,\nthe inherent redundancy existing in distributed storage systems can be used to\nimprove the performance of those schemes through parallelism.\n  This paper designs a scheme combining distributed storage of the content in\nmultiple servers and an efficient coded caching algorithm for delivery to the\nusers. This scheme is shown to reduce the peak transmission rate below that of\nstate-of-the-art algorithms.\n","Comment: submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

However, most face datasets accessible for training and\nverification are only collected in the VIS (visible light) spectrum. It remains\na challenging problem to match NIR to VIS face images due to the different\nlight spectrum. Recently, breakthroughs have been made for VIS face recognition\nby applying deep learning on a huge amount of labeled VIS face samples. The\nsame deep learning approach cannot be simply applied to NIR face recognition\nfor two main reasons: First, much limited NIR face images are available for\ntraining compared to the VIS spectrum. Second, face galleries to be matched are\nmostly available only in the VIS spectrum. In this paper, we propose an\napproach to extend the deep learning breakthrough for VIS face recognition to\nthe NIR spectrum, without retraining the underlying deep models that see only\nVIS faces. Our approach consists of two core components, cross-spectral\nhallucination and low-rank embedding, to optimize respectively input and output\nof a VIS deep model for cross-spectral face recognition. Cross-spectral\nhallucination produces VIS faces from NIR images through a deep learning\napproach. Low-rank embedding restores a low-rank structure for faces deep\nfeatures across both NIR and VIS spectrum. We observe that it is often equally\neffective to perform hallucination to input NIR images or low-rank embedding to\noutput deep features for a VIS deep model for cross-spectral recognition. When\nhallucination and low-rank embedding are deployed together, we observe\nsignificant further improvement; we obtain state-of-the-art accuracy on the\nCASIA NIR-VIS v2.0 benchmark, without the need at all to re-train the\nrecognition system.\n"]}]

Then most existing models\nusually utilize one-dimensional (1D) max pooling operation or attention-based\noperation only on the time-step dimension to obtain a fixed-length vector.\nHowever, the features on the feature vector dimension are not mutually\nindependent, and simply applying 1D pooling operation over the time-step\ndimension independently may destroy the structure of the feature\nrepresentation.

Since\nthe execution is performed in hardware, FPGA gives much higher performance and\nlower energy consumption compared to most microprocessor-based systems.\nHowever, the room to improve FPGA performance still exists, e.g. when it is\nused by multiple users. In multi-user approaches, FPGA resources are shared\nbetween several users. Therefore, one must be able to interrupt a running\ncircuit at any given time and continue the task at will.

The ability to extract and restore the context is\nknown as context-switch.In the previous work [1], an automatic checkpoint\nselection method is proposed for circuit generation targeting reconfigurable\nsystems. The method relies on static analysis of the finite state machine of a\ncircuit to select the checkpoint states.

We show that active neutrinos can\nget Majorana masses from radiative corrections, after adding only new singly\ncharged Higgs bosons. The mechanism for generating neutrino masses is the same\nas that shown in Zee models. This also gives a hint to solve the dark matter\nproblem based on similar ways discussed recently in many radiative neutrino\nmass models with dark matter. Except the active neutrinos, the appearance of\nsingly charged Higgs bosons and dark matters does not affect significantly the\nphysical spectrum of all particles in the original model. We indicate this\npoint by investigating the Higgs sector in both cases before and after singly\ncharged scalars are added into it. Many interesting properties of physical\nHiggs bosons, that were not shown previously, are explored. In particular, the\nmass matrices of charged and CP-odd Higgs fields are proportional to a\ncoefficient of triple Higgs coupling $\\mu$. The mass eigenstates and\neigenvalues in the CP-even Higgs sector are also presented. All couplings of\nthe SM-like Higgs boson to normal fermions and gauge bosons are different from\nthe SM prediction's a factor $c_h$ that must satisfy the recent global fit of\nexperimental data, namely $0.995<|c_h|<1$.

This diagnostic will be used on WEST for W transport studies and\nwill be equipped with two new GEM based poloidal cameras allowing 2D\ntomographic reconstructions with spectral resolution in energy bands. Thus once\nGEM response to plasma emissivity is characterized thanks to synthetic\ndiagnostic, it offers new possibilities to disentangle the different SXR\ncontributions in harsh fusion environments like e.g. WEST or ITER with respect\nto conventional semiconductor diodes working in current mode. Emitted SXR\nspectrum from the plasma is modelled thanks to ADAS database from given WEST\nscenario. The synthetic diagnostic includes Lines of Sight (LoS) etendues of\nthe two cameras as well as probability of photoabsorption through filters,\nphotoionization in the detection gas mixture (Ar-CO2), and transport of\nelectron avalanches in the gas through GEM foils as computed with Magboltz.\nLocal SXR emissivity is then retrieved from tomographic inversion using a\nMinimum Fisher Information (MFI) algorithm.\n","Comment: in 43rd European Physical Society Conference on Plasma Physics, Jul\n  2016, Leuven, Belgium"]}]

We investigate the fine-grained complexity of these\nproblems on sparse graphs, and our main results are the following:\n  1. Reductions and Algorithms. We define the notion of a sparse reduction that\npreserves graph sparsity, and we present several such reductions for graph\nproblems in the $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ class.

We develop new techniques\nin order to preserve sparsity in our reductions, many of which are nontrivial\nand intricate. Some of our reductions also lead to improved algorithms for\nvarious problems on finding simple cycles in undirected graphs.\n  2. Conditional Hardness. We show that if the Strong Exponential Time\nHypothesis (SETH) holds, then several problems in the $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ class,\nincluding certain problems that are also in the sub-cubic equivalence class\ncannot have `sub-$mn$' time algorithms, i.e., algorithms that run in\n$O(m^{\\alpha} \\cdot n^{2-\\alpha -\\epsilon})$ time, for constants $\\alpha \\geq\n0$, $\\epsilon > 0$. In particular, this result means that under SETH, the\nsub-cubic equivalence class is split into at least two classes when sparsity is\ntaken into account, with triangle finding problems having faster algorithms\nthan Eccentricities or Betweenness Centrality. This hardness result for the\n$\\tilde{O}(mn)$ class is also surprising because a similar hardness result for\nthe sub-cubic class is considered unlikely since this would falsify NSETH\n(Nondeterministic SETH).\n"]}]
