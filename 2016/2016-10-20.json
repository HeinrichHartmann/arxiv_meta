Recent experimental and theoretical studies suggest that\nquantum coherence and entanglement may play a role in this excitation energy\ntransfer (EET). We examine whether bipartite quantum nonlocality, a property\nthat expresses a stronger-than-entanglement form of correlation, exists between\ndifferent pairs of chromophores in the FMO complex when modeling the EET by the\nhierarchically coupled equations of motion method. We compare the results for\nnonlocality with the amount of bipartite entanglement in the system. In\nparticular, we analyze in what way these correlation properties are affected by\ndifferent initial conditions. It is found that bipartite nonlocality only\nexists when the initial conditions are chosen in an unphysiological manner and\nprobably is absent when considering the EET in the FMO complex in its natural\nhabitat. It is also seen that nonlocality and entanglement behave quite\ndifferently in this system. In particular, for localized initial states,\nnonlocality only exists on a very short time scale and then drops to zero in an\nabrupt manner. As already known from previous studies, quantum entanglement\nbetween chromophore pairs on the other hand is oscillating and exponentially\ndecaying and follow thereby a pattern more similar to the chromophore\npopulation dynamics. The abrupt disappearance of nonlocality in the presence of\nnonvanishing entanglement is a phenomenon we call nonlocality sudden death; a\nstriking manifestation of the difference between these two types of\ncorrelations in quantum systems.\n","Comment: Revised version; journal reference added"]}]

Using a quadruple\nquantum dot formed in a Si/SiGe heterostructure, we show the first\ndemonstration of coherent two-axis control of a double quantum dot charge qubit\nin undoped Si/SiGe, performing Larmor and Ramsey oscillation measurements. We\nextract the strength of the capacitive coupling between double quantum dots by\nmeasuring the detuning energy shift ($\\approx$ 75 $\\mu$eV) of one double dot\ndepending on the excess charge configuration of the other double dot. We\nfurther demonstrate that the strong capacitive coupling allows fast conditional\nLandau-Zener-Stuckelberg interferences with conditonal $\\pi$ phase flip time\nabout 80 ps, showing promising pathways toward multi-qubit entanglement control\nin semiconductor quantum dots.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures including supplementary information"]}]

In the present paper a new approach to estimate the number of\ndimensions will be introduced and compared via simulation to the traditional\ntechniques pointed above. The approach proposed in the current paper is called\nexploratory graph analysis (EGA), since it is based on the graphical lasso with\nthe regularization parameter specified using EBIC. The number of dimensions is\nverified using the walktrap, a random walk algorithm used to identify\ncommunities in networks. In total, 32,000 data sets were simulated to fit known\nfactor structures, with the data sets varying across different criteria: number\nof factors (2 and 4), number of items (5 and 10), sample size (100, 500, 1000\nand 5000) and correlation between factors (orthogonal, .20, .50 and .70),\nresulting in 64 different conditions.

This paper investigates the density of\ncodes in the complex Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds equipped with their\ncommonly used chordal distance. The choice of distance enforces the treatment\nof the manifolds as subspaces of Euclidean hyperspheres. In this geometry, the\ndensest packings are not necessarily equivalent to the maximum-minimum-distance\ncodes. Computing a code's density follows from computing i) the normalized\nvolume of a metric ball and ii) the kissing radius, the radius of the largest\nballs one can pack around the codewords without overlapping. First, the\nnormalized volume of a metric ball is evaluated by asymptotic approximations.\nFor a small ball, its volume can be well-approximated by the volume of a\nlocally-equivalent tangential ball. In order to properly normalize this\napproximation, the precise volumes of the manifolds induced by their spherical\nembedding are computed. For larger balls, a hyperspherical cap approximation is\nused, which is justified by a volume comparison theorem showing that the\nnormalized volume of a ball in the Stiefel or Grassmann manifold is\nasymptotically equal to the normalized volume of a ball in its embedding sphere\nas the dimension grows to infinity. Then, bounds on the kissing radius are\nderived alongside corresponding bounds on the density. Unlike for spherical\ncodes or for codes in flat spaces, the kissing radius of a Grassmann or Stiefel\ncode cannot be exactly determined from its minimum distance. It is nonetheless\npossible to derive bounds on density as functions of the minimum distance.\nStiefel and Grassmann codes have larger density than their image spherical\ncodes when dimensions tend to infinity. The bounds on density lead to\nrefinements of the standard Hamming bounds for Stiefel and Grassmann codes.\n","Comment: Update of the first version in which the unconventional notation\n  N(mean,standard_deviation) for normal distributions was used.

Dynamical maps on representative planes\nare constructed numerically, in order to characterize the phase-space structure\nand identify the precise location of resonances. The study is complemented by\nthe construction of dynamical power spectra, which provide the identification\nof fundamental oscillatory patterns in the stellar motion.\n  Results: Our approach allows a precise description of the resonance chains in\nthe whole phase space, giving a broader view of the dynamics of the system when\ncompared to the classical epicyclic approach, even for objects in retrograde\nmotion. The analysis of the solar neighbourhood shows that, depending on the\ncurrent azimuthal phase of the Sun with respect to the spiral arms, a star with\nsolar kinematic parameters may evolve either inside the stable co-rotation\nresonance or in a chaotic zone.\n  Conclusions: Our approach contributes to quantifying the domains of resonant\norbits and the degree of chaos in the whole Galactic phase-space structure. It\nmay serve as a starting point to apply these techniques to the investigation of\nclumps in the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, such as kinematic moving\ngroups.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 15 figures.

This\npaper provides a theoretical justification for the use of anonymized data.\nSpecifically, we show that a support vector classifier trained on anatomized\ndata satisfying l-diversity should be expected to do as well as on the original\ndata. Anatomy preserves all data values, but introduces uncertainty in the\nmapping between identifying and sensitive values, thus satisfying l-diversity.\nThe theoretical effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated using\nseveral publicly available datasets, showing that we outperform the state of\nthe art for support vector classification using training data protected by\nk-anonymity, and are comparable to learning on the original data.\n","Comment: Technical Report"]}]

Currently, the\ncommonly applied method is by visual inspection, which is very time-consuming\nand it is easy to overlook some noisy bands. In this study, we find an inherent\nconnection between target detection algorithms and the corrupted band removal.\nAs an example, for the matched filter (MF), which is the most widely used\ntarget detection method for hyperspectral data, we present an automatic\nMF-based algorithm for bad band identification. The MF detector is a filter\nvector, and the resulting filter output is the sum of all bands weighted by the\nMF coefficients. Therefore, we can identify bad bands only by using the MF\nfilter vector itself, the absolute value of whose entry accounts for the\nimportance of each band for the target detection. For a specific target of\ninterest, the bands with small MF weights correspond to the noisy or bad ones.\nBased on this fact, we develop an automatic bad band preremoval algorithm by\nutilizing the average absolute value of MF weights for multiple targets within\na scene. Experiments with three well known hyperspectral datasets show that our\nmethod can always identify the water absorption and other low signal-to-noise\n(SNR) bands that are usually chosen as bad bands manually.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In streaky wall flows it is remarkable that\nthere exist both dynamical mechanism exciting transverse waves and an energy\nchannel of exchange between flow field and transverse wave field.

Thus,\nthere exists a sustaining mechanism, which implies that the streaky structure\nof wall-bounded turbulence is a dissipative structure.\n  The predictions are consistent with characteristic features of wall\nturbulence found in experimental studies, with respect to three points in\nparticular. 1.

Our research is motivated by deceased donor kidney transplants, from\nwhich recipients would experience graft failure, death with functioning graft\n(DWFG), or graft survival. The occurrence of DWFG precludes graft failure from\nhappening and therefore is a competing risk. Data within a transplant center\nmay be correlated due to a latent center effect, such as varying patient\npopulations, surgical techniques, and patient management. The proportional\nsubdistribution hazard (PSH) model has been frequently used in the regression\nanalysis of competing risks data. Two of its extensions, the stratified and the\nmarginal PSH models, can be applied to multi-center data to account for the\ncenter effect. In this paper, we propose penalization strategies for the two\nmodels, primarily to select important variables and estimate their effects\nwhereas correlations within centers serve as a nuisance. Simulations\ndemonstrate good performance and computational efficiency for the proposed\nmethods. It is further assessed using an analysis of data from the United\nNetwork of Organ Sharing.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

The greatest variability in tolerance was observed at moderate\nsalt stress (200 mM of NaCl) and the decrease in germination appeared to be\nmore accentuated in A. cyanophylla and A. cyclops.

We apply these models to analyse the flow volume and the whole\nstreamflow curve during a given period by using precipitations curves. The\nfunctional model is shown to lead to encouraging results. The potential of\nfunctional linear models to detect special features that would have been hard\nto see otherwise is pointed out. The functional model is also compared to the\nartificial neural network approach and the advantages and disadvantages of both\nmodels are discussed. Finally, future research directions involving the\nfunctional model in hydrology are presented.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 12 figures"]}]

A new fast method is presented for computation of the\nprobabilities for these distributions. We calculate the count probabilities by\nrepeatedly convolving the discretized distribution, and then correct them using\nRichardson extrapolation. When just one probability is required, a second\nalgorithm is described, an adaptation of De Pril's method, in which the\ncomputation time does not depend on the ordinality, so that even high-order\nprobabilities can be rapidly found. Any survival distribution can be used to\nmodel the inter-arrival times, which gives a rich class of models with great\nflexibility for modelling both underdispersed and overdispersed data. This work\ncould pave the way for the routine use of these distributions as an additional\ntool for modelling event count data.
