VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 bind vascular\nendothelial growth factors (VEGFs), inducing receptor dimerisation and\nactivation, characterised by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in their\ncytoplasmic domain. Although experimental evidence suggests that RTK signalling\noccurs both on the plasma membrane and intra-cellularly, and reveals the role\nof endocytosis in RTK signal transduction, we still lack knowledge of VEGFR\nphosphorylation-site use and of the spatiotemporal regulation of VEGFR\nsignalling. In this paper, we introduce four stochastic mathematical models to\nstudy the binding kinetics of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A to\nVEGFR1 and VEGFR2, and phosphorylation. The formation of phosphorylated dimers\non the cell surface is a two-step process: diffusive transport and binding.

Our results indicate that the presence of VEGFR1 does not\nonly affect the timescale to reach a given signalling threshold, but it also\naffects the maximum attainable threshold.

Today, wireless sensor network (WSN) has become a key\ntechnology for different types of smart environment. Nodes localization in WSN\nhas arisen as a very challenging problem in the research community. Most of the\napplications for WSN are not useful without a priory known nodes positions.\nAdding GPS receivers to each node is an expensive solution and inapplicable for\nindoor environments. In this paper, we implemented and evaluated an algorithm\nbased on multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique for three-dimensional (3D)\nnodes localization in WSN using improved heuristic method for distance\ncalculation. Using extensive simulations we investigated our approach regarding\nvarious network parameters. We compared the results from the simulations with\nother approaches for 3D-WSN localization and showed that our approach\noutperforms other techniques in terms of accuracy.\n"]}]
