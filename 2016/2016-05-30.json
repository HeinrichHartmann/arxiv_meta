The FRET rate is controlled by the mirror up to distances\ncomparable to the donor-acceptor distance, that is, the few-nanometer range.\nFor vanishing distance, we find a complete inhibition or a four-fold\nenhancement, depending on dipole orientation. For mirror distances on the\nwavelength scale, where the well-known `Drexhage' modification of the\nspontaneous-emission rate occurs, the FRET rate is constant. Hence there is no\ncorrelation between the Foerster (or total) energy transfer rate and the LDOS.\nAt any distance to the mirror, the total energy transfer between a\nclosely-spaced donor and acceptor is dominated by Foerster transfer, i.e., by\nthe static dipole-dipole interaction that yields the characteristic\ninverse-sixth-power donor-acceptor distance dependence in homogeneous media.\nGeneralizing to arbitrary inhomogeneous media with weak dispersion and weak\nabsorption in the frequency overlap range of donor and acceptor, we derive two\nmain theoretical results. Firstly, the spatially dependent Foerster energy\ntransfer rate does not depend on frequency, hence not on the LDOS. Secondly the\nFRET rate is expressed as a frequency integral of the imaginary part of the\nGreen function. This leads to an approximate FRET rate in terms of the LDOS\nintegrated over a huge bandwidth from zero frequency to about 10 times the\ndonor emission frequency, corresponding to the vacuum-ultraviolet. Even then,\nthe broadband LDOS hardly contributes to the energy transfer rates. We discuss\npractical consequences including quantum information processing.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures"]}]

For this reason, its\npotential impact on our society has been compared to that of chemical alloying.\nAlthough significant progress has been made in the last years on strained\nnanomaterials, strain fields (which are of tensorial nature, with six\nindependent components) are still mostly used in a \"scalar\" and/or static\nfashion. Here we present a new class of strain actuators which allow the three\ncomponents of the in-plane stress tensor in a nanomembrane to be independently\nand reversibly controlled. The actuators are based on monolithic piezoelectric\nsubstrates, which are micro-machined via femtosecond-laser processing. Their\nfunctionality is demonstrated by \"programming\" arbitrary stress states in a\nsemiconductor layer, whose light emission is used as a local and sensitive\nstrain gauge. The results shown in this work open a new route to investigate\nand make use of strain effects in materials and devices.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The hyperparameters of this hierarchical model, instead of\nconsidered fixed, are to be substituted with data-dependent values in such a\nway that the point risk of the empirical Bayes estimator is small. Our method\nchooses the hyperparameters by minimizing an unbiased risk estimate and is\nshown to be asymptotically optimal for the estimation problem defined above.\nThe usual empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) is shown to be\nsubstantially different from the proposed method in the unbalanced case and\ntherefore performs sub-optimally. Our estimator is implemented through a\ncomputationally tractable algorithm that is scalable to work under large\ndesigns. The case of missing cell observations is treated as well.

These methods are able\nto manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply\nrequiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup in\nhigh-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize\nthese densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that output\nthe correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two\nmain ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an\nexpectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a\nsmooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms\nthat have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in three\ndifferent setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, we\nshow that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn's\nalgorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) when\ncomparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discrete\nreformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient\ndescent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem\nby discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, we\npropose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS). This is currently the only known method to solve this problem, apart\nfrom computing OT on finite samples. We backup these claims on a set of\ndiscrete, semi-discrete and continuous benchmark problems.\n"]}]

However,\nthey are limited in the sense that they cannot discriminate among component\nmodels effectively. In this paper, we propose stacking with auxiliary features\nthat learns to fuse relevant information from multiple systems to improve\nperformance. Auxiliary features enable the stacker to rely on systems that not\njust agree on an output but also the provenance of the output. We demonstrate\nour approach on three very different and difficult problems -- the Cold Start\nSlot Filling, the Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking and the ImageNet\nobject detection tasks.

The SZE signature is measured using matched-filtered maps of\nthe 2500 deg$^2$ SPT-SZ survey at the positions of the DES clusters, and the\ndegeneracy between SZE observable and matched-filter size is broken by adopting\nas priors SZE and optical mass-observable relations that are either calibrated\nusing SPT selected clusters or through the Arnaud et al.

We measure the SPT signal to noise $\\zeta$-$\\lambda$, relation and\ntwo integrated Compton-$y$ $Y_\\textrm{500}$-$\\lambda$ relations for the\nDES-selected clusters and compare these to model expectations accounting for\nthe SZE-optical center offset distribution. For clusters with $\\lambda > 80$,\nthe two SPT calibrated scaling relations are consistent with the measurements,\nwhile for the A10-calibrated relation the measured SZE signal is smaller by a\nfactor of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ compared to the prediction.

We quantify the required\ncorrections to achieve consistency, showing that there is a richness dependent\nbias that can be explained by some combination of contamination of the\nobservables and biases in the estimated masses.
