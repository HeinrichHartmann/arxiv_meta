The\nreconstruction of the bias relation from PDFs is performed through a novel\nmethod that accounts for Poisson noise, redshift distortions, inhomogeneous sky\ncoverage and other selection effects. With this procedure we constrain galaxy\nbias and its deviations from linearity down to scales as small as 4 Mpc/h and\nout to z=1.1. We detect small (~3%) but significant deviations from linear\nbias. The mean biasing function is close to linear in regions above the mean\ndensity. The mean slope of the biasing relation is a proxy to the linear bias\nparameter. It increases both with luminosity, in agreement with results of\nprevious analyses, and with redshift. However, we detect a strong bias\nevolution only for z>0.9 in agreement with some, but not all, previous studies.\nWe also detected a significant increase of the bias with the scale, from 4 to 8\nMpc/h, now seen for the first time out to z=1. The amplitude of nonlinearity\ndepends on redshift, luminosity and on scales but no clear trend is detected.\nThanks to the large cosmic volume probed by VIPERS we find that the mismatch\nbetween the previous estimates of bias at z~1 from zCOSMOS and VVDS-Deep galaxy\nsamples is fully accounted for by cosmic variance.

Using the perturbative approach we obtain an analytical\nexpression for the inverse localization length (ILL) derived for the case of\nrandomly fluctuating geometric and energetic parameters. In the first case,\nwhen the barrier (well) width fluctuates around its mean value, the\ncorresponding equation for the ILL reveals the presence of the Fabry-Perot\nresonances, at which the localization length diverges. These resonances are\nexact, i.e., are stored in any degree of disorder. It has been found that the\nlocalization properties manifest stronger for the particles with energies lying\nin the non-resonant bands where our approach is extremely sensitive to the\ndegree of disorder. For the case of weakly fluctuating both barrier and well\nwidths we analytically obtain ILL taking correlations into account. The main\neffect of the correlations, which lead to an increase (or decrease) in the\nlocalization length, was revealed near the double resonance arising at\ncoincidence of two Fabry-Perot resonances associated with barrier and well\nwidths. The random fluctuations of the potential strength also lead to the\ndelocalization resonances. However, they exist only in a weak-disorder\napproximation.

In spontaneous fission, half-lives are the main observables\nand quantum tunnelling the essential concept, while in induced fission the\nfocus is on fragment properties and explicitly time-dependent approaches are\nneeded. The cornerstone of the current microscopic theory of fission is the\nenergy density functional formalism. Its basic tenets, including tools such as\nthe HFB theory, effective two-body effective nuclear potentials,\nfinite-temperature extensions and beyond mean-field corrections, are presented\nsuccinctly. The EDF approach is often combined with the hypothesis that the\ntime-scale of the large amplitude collective motion driving the system to\nfission is slow compared to typical time-scales of nucleons inside the nucleus.\nIn practice, this hypothesis of adiabaticity is implemented by introducing (a\nfew) collective variables and mapping out the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation\ninto a collective Schr\\\"odinger-like equation for the nuclear wave-packet.\nScission configurations indicate where the split occurs. This collective\nSchr\\\"odinger equation depends on an inertia tensor that includes the response\nof the system to small changes in the collective variables and also plays a\nspecial role in the determination of spontaneous fission half-lives. A\ntrademark of the microscopic theory of fission is the tremendous amount of\ncomputing needed for practical applications.

The role of excitation and abundances\nwere studied in this context. Spatial distributions of the 12CO and 13CO\nemission show significant differences. 12CO traces the large-scale molecular\ngas reservoir, associated with a dust lane that harbors infalling gas. 13CO\nemission is - for the first time - detected in the large-scale dust lane. Its\nemission peaks between dust lane and circumnuclear molecular ring. A\n12CO-to-13CO1-0 intensity ratio map shows high values in the ring region (~30)\ntypical for the centers of luminous galaxy mergers and even more extreme values\nin the dust lane (>45). This drop in ratio is consistent with molecular gas in\nthe dust lane being in a diffuse, unbound state while being funneled towards\nthe nucleus.

These biases also lead to\nsignificant differences in the mass--metallicity relation, the kinematics of\nlow-mass satellites, the number counts of small satellites associated with the\nMagellanic Clouds, and the stellar mass of Milky Way itself. Observations of\nthese galaxy properties can thus provide useful constraints on the properties\nof the Milky Way halo.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ.

Unlike most of the existing methods that learn either a\ndirect mapping from visual features to their semantic representations or a\ncommon latent space by the joint use of visual features and their semantic\nrepresentations, we propose a stagewise bidirectional latent embedding\nframework for zero-shot visual recognition.

Chemical\nkinetics models have been widely used in the literature to investigate the\nchemical compositions of hot Jupiter atmospheres which are expected to be\ndriven away from chemical equilibrium via processes such as vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. All of these models have so far used pressure--temperature\n(P-T) profiles as fixed model input. This results in a decoupling of the\nchemistry from the radiative and thermal properties of the atmosphere, despite\nthe fact that in nature they are intricately linked. We use a one-dimensional\nradiative-convective equilibrium model, ATMO, which includes a sophisticated\nchemistry scheme to calculate P-T profiles which are fully consistent with\nnon-equilibrium chemical abundances, including vertical mixing and\nphotochemistry. Our primary conclusion is that, in cases of strong chemical\ndisequilibrium, consistent calculations can lead to differences in the P-T\nprofile of up to 100 K compared to the P-T profile derived assuming chemical\nequilibrium. This temperature change can, in turn, have important consequences\nfor the chemical abundances themselves as well as for the simulated emission\nspectra.

The\nseparations of optical types according to radio core dominance as well as\nNIR/MIR ratios, which are essentially perfect, means that there can be only a\nsmall dispersion of torus half-opening angles. Also, even though torus dust is\nthought to be clumpy, there is an almost zero probability to see a type-1\nsource at high inclination. Finally, using only the Copernican Principle, i,e,\nthe assumption that solid angle is filled uniformly with source axis\norientations, we estimated a semi-empirical relation between core dominance and\nAGN inclination.

The performance of\nboth conventional ANNs and GANNs to estimate the stellar parameters as a\nfunction of the star brightness is presented and compared for different\nGalactic populations.

To understand the effect of the three-dimensional temperature and\ndensity structure in the solar atmosphere on the formation of the He i 1083 nm\nline. Methods.

As a model atmosphere we use a snapshot from a\n3D radiation-MHD simulation computed with the Bifrost code. Ionising radiation\nfrom the corona is self-consistently taken into account. Results. The emergent\nintensity in the He i 1083 nm is set by the source function and the opacity in\nthe upper chromosphere. The former is dominated by scattering of photospheric\nradiation and does not vary much with spatial location. The latter is\ndetermined by the photonionisation rate in the He i ground state continuum, as\nwell as the electron density in the chromosphere. The spatial variation of the\nflux of ionising radiation is caused by the spatially-structured emissivity of\nthe ionising photons from material at T = 100 kK in the transition region. The\nhotter coronal material produces more ionising photons, but the resulting\nradiation field is smooth and does not lead to small-scale variation of the UV\nflux. The corrugation of the transition region further increases the spatial\nvariation of the amount of UV radiation in the chromosphere.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

A laser beam driving the cavity at its resonance\nfrequency will acquire red- and blue-shifted sidebands due to noise in the\nposition of the mechanical oscillator. In a classical theory without noise in\nthe electromagnetic field, the powers of these sidebands are of equal\nmagnitude.

In the optical\nregime, standard photodetection theory leads to a photocurrent noise spectrum\ngiven by normal and time ordered expectation values. The sideband asymmetry is\nin that case a direct reflection of the quantum asymmetry of the position noise\nspectrum of the mechanical oscillator. Conversely, for a detector that measures\nsymmetric, non-ordered expectation values, we show that the sideband asymmetry\ncan be traced back to quantum optomechanical interference terms. This ambiguity\nin interpretation applies not only to mechanical oscillators, but to any degree\nof freedom that couples linearly to noise in the electromagnetic field.\nFinally, we also compare the quantum theory to a fully classical model, where\nsideband asymmetry can arise from classical optomechanical interference terms.\nWe show that, due to the oscillator's lack of zero point motion in a classical\ntheory, the sidebands in the photocurrent spectrum differ qualitatively from\nthose of a quantum theory at sufficiently low temperatures.

(2) Blazars are classified as\nlow synchrotron peak sources (LSPs) if $\\log\\nu_{\\rm p}$(Hz) $\\leq 14.0$,\nintermediate synchrotron peak sources (ISPs) if $14.0 < \\log\\nu_{\\rm p}$(Hz)\n$\\leq 15.3$, and high synchrotron peak sources (HSPs) if $\\log\\nu_{\\rm p}$(Hz)\n$> 15.3$.

We present numerical results from a\nseries of nonlinear, 3-D simulations of rotating convection and examine the\nvelocity power distribution realized under a range of Rossby numbers.

However, at odds with\nthis theoretical prediction, recent observations indicate that in the low\namplitude regime such transverse MHD waves can also appear decay-less, a yet\nunsolved phenomenon. Recent numerical work has shown that Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities (KHI) often accompany transverse MHD waves.

We post-process high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of\nclumpy discs using accurate radiative transfer to model the effect of ionizing\nradiation from young stars and to compute H$\\alpha$ emission maps. By comparing\nthe intrinsic clump size and mass distributions with those inferred from\nconvolving the H$\\alpha$ maps with different gaussian apertures, we mimick the\ntypical resolution used in observations. We found that with 100 pc resolution,\nmock observations can recover the intrinsic clump radii and stellar masses, in\nagreement with those found by lensing observations. Instead, using a 1 kpc\nresolution smears out individual clumps, resulting in their apparent merging.\nThis causes significant overestimations of the clump radii and, therefore,\nmasses derived using methods that use their observed sizes. We show that\nlimited sensitivity can also force observations to significantly overestimate\nthe clump masses. We conclude that a significant fraction of giant clumps\ndetected in the observations may result from artificially inflated radii and\nmasses, and that $\\approx 100$ pc spatial resolution is required to capture\ncorrectly the physical characteristics of star-forming clumps if they are\ncoherent structures produced by disc fragmentation.\n","Comment: submitted to MNRAS on 07.10.2016.

Either\nsimple local algorithms succeed in estimating the object of interest, or even\nsophisticated semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations fail.\n  In order to explore this phenomenon, we study a classical SDP relaxation of\nthe minimum graph bisection problem, when applied to Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi random\ngraphs with bounded average degree $d>1$, and obtain several types of results.\nFirst, we use a dual witness construction (using the so-called non-backtracking\nmatrix of the graph) to upper bound the SDP value. Second, we prove that a\nsimple local algorithm approximately solves the SDP to within a factor\n$2d^2/(2d^2+d-1)$ of the upper bound. In particular, the local algorithm is at\nmost $8/9$ suboptimal, and $1+O(1/d)$ suboptimal for large degree.\n  We then analyze a more sophisticated local algorithm, which aggregates\ninformation according to the harmonic measure on the limiting Galton-Watson\n(GW) tree. The resulting lower bound is expressed in terms of the conductance\nof the GW tree and matches surprisingly well the empirically determined SDP\nvalues on large-scale Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi graphs.\n  We finally consider the planted partition model. In this case, purely local\nalgorithms are known to fail, but they do succeed if a small amount of side\ninformation is available.

Small mass planets do\nnot affect the gas profile and migrate in the fast type~I migration. Although\ntype~I migration can be directed outwards for planets smaller than $20-30\nM_\\oplus$, planets above this mass should be lost into the central star long\nbefore the disc disperses. Massive planets open a gap and subsequently migrate\nin the slower, type~II migration, which could save them from migrating all the\nway to the star. Hence, growing giant planets can be saved if and only if they\ncan reach the gap opening mass, because this extends their migration\ntime-scale, allowing them to eventually survive at large orbits until the disc\nitself disperses.\n  However, most of the previous studies only measured the torques on planets\nwith fixed masses and orbits to determine the migration rate. Additionally, the\ntransition between type~I and type~II migration itself is not well studied.\nHere we use isothermal 2D disc simulations with FARGO-2D1D to study the\nmigration behaviour of gas accreting protoplanets in discs. We find that\nmigrating giant planets always open gaps in the disc. We further show\nanalytically and numerically that planets growing in the runaway gas accretion\nregime will reach gap opening masses before migrating all the way to the\ncentral star if the disc is not extremely viscous and/or thick. An accretion\nrate limited to the radial gas flow in the disc, in contrast, is not fast\nenough. When gas accretion by the planet is taken into account, the gap opening\nprocess is accelerated because the planet accretes material originating from\nits horseshoe region. This allows an accreting planet to transition to type~II\nmigration before being lost even if gas fails to be provided for a rapid enough\ngrowth and the gap opening mass is not reached.\n","Comment: In press in Icarus"]}]

Assortment personalization is\nthe problem of choosing, for each individual or consumer segment (type), a best\nassortment of products, ads, or other offerings (items) so as to maximize\nrevenue. This problem is central to revenue management in e-commerce, online\nadvertising, and multi-location brick-and-mortar retail, where both items and\ntypes can number in the thousands-to-millions. Data efficiency is paramount in\nthis large-scale setting. A good personalization strategy must dynamically\nbalance the need to learn consumer preferences and to maximize revenue.\n  We formulate the dynamic assortment personalization problem as a\ndiscrete-contextual bandit with $m$ contexts (customer types) and many arms\n(assortments of the $n$ items). We assume that each type's preferences follow a\nsimple parametric model with $n$ parameters. In all, there are $mn$ parameters,\nand existing literature suggests that order optimal regret scales as $mn$.\nHowever, this figure is orders of magnitude larger than the data available in\nlarge-scale applications, and imposes unacceptably high regret.\n  In this paper, we impose natural structure on the problem -- a small latent\ndimension, or low rank. In the static setting, we show that this model can be\nefficiently learned from surprisingly few interactions, using a time- and\nmemory-efficient optimization algorithm that converges globally whenever the\nmodel is learnable. In the dynamic setting, we show that structure-aware\ndynamic assortment personalization can have regret that is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than structure-ignorant approaches.

This is the first example of a blow-up\nsolution with a characteristic point in higher dimensions, showing a really\ntwo-dimensional behavior.\n  Moreover, the points of the bisectrices outside the origin give us the first\nexample of non-characteristic points where the blow-up surface is\nnon-differentiable.\n","Comment: 74 pages"]}]

The field's action on the particle is difficult to calculate because\nof its singular nature: the field diverges at the position of the particle. But\nit is possible to isolate the field's singular part and show that it exerts no\nforce on the particle -- its only effect is to contribute to the particle's\ninertia. What remains after subtraction is a smooth field that is fully\nresponsible for the self-force. Because this field satisfies a homogeneous wave\nequation, it can be thought of as a free (radiative) field that interacts with\nthe particle; it is this interaction that gives rise to the self-force. The\nmathematical tools required to derive the equations of motion of a point scalar\ncharge, a point electric charge, and a point mass in a specified background\nspacetime are developed here from scratch. The review begins with a discussion\nof the basic theory of bitensors (part I). It then applies the theory to the\nconstruction of convenient coordinate systems to chart a neighbourhood of the\nparticle's word line (part II). It continues with a thorough discussion of\nGreen's functions in curved spacetime (part III). The review concludes with a\ndetailed derivation of each of the three equations of motion (part IV).\n","Comment: LaTeX2e, 116 pages, 10 figures.
