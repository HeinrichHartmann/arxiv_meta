Consequently, the dissertation is\nstructured in two sections. In the first one, a novel proposal is suggested\nregarding to using Cherenkov telescopes as ground-station receivers. A\nfeasibility study addresses the posibility of using the technology developed\nfor the gamma-ray telescopes that will make up the Cherenkov Telescope Array\n(CTA) in the implementation of a new kind of ground station. Among the main\nadvantages that these telescopes provide are the much larger apertures needed\nto overcome the power limitation that ground-based gamma-ray astronomy and\ndeep-space optical communication both have. Also, the large number of big\ntelescopes that will be built for CTA will make it possible to reduce unitary\ncosts by economy-scale production. The second section of the thesis is framed\nin the field of free-space Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which has become a\nnew paradigm in the discipline of information security. This technique offers a\ntheoretically-secure way to communicate over an insecure channel since the\npresence of an eventual eavesdropper can be detected. The main challenge of\nFree-space QKD is the need to operate both under strong atmospheric turbulence\nand daylight background noise. To mitigate these effects, a trade-off is\nusually required when designing the receiver's optics, since a narrow\nfield-of-view improves background noise rejection, but increases\nturbulence-related losses and a wide field-of-view produces the opposite\neffect. A correction system for atmospheric turbulence is proposed to overcome\nboth limitations at the same time, and different strategies are analyzed and\nexperimented to carry out the implementation and integration within the QKD\nsystem.\n","Comment: 296 pages, in Spanish, 221 figures.

Subsequent studies in this series have focused on\nidentifying under what condi- tions layers form (Mirouh et al. 2012), and\nquantifying transport through layered systems (Wood et al. 2013).

Their elastic\nand transport properties are believed to play an important role for thermal and\nmagnetic field evolution, rotation and oscillation of neutron stars.\nFurthermore, they can impact neutrino opacities in core-collapse supernovae. In\nthis work, we present proof-of-principle 3D Skyrme Hartree-Fock (SHF)\nsimulations of nuclear pasta with the Multi-resolution ADaptive Numerical\nEnvironment for Scientific Simulations (MADNESS). We perform benchmark studies\nof $^{16} \\mathrm{O}$, $^{208} \\mathrm{Pb}$ and $^{238} \\mathrm{U}$ nuclear\nground states and calculate binding energies via 3D SHF simulations. Results\nare compared with experimentally measured binding energies as well as with\ntheoretically predicted values from an established SHF code. The nuclear pasta\nsimulation is initialized in the so-called waffle geometry as obtained by the\nIndiana University Molecular Dynamics (IUMD) code. The size of the unit cell is\n24\\:fm with an average density of about $\\rho = 0.05 \\:\\mathrm{fm}^{-3}$,\nproton fraction of $Y_p = 0.3$ and temperature of $T=0\\:$MeV. Our calculations\nreproduce the binding energies and shapes of light and heavy nuclei with\ndifferent geometries. For the pasta simulation, we find that the final geometry\nis very similar to the initial waffle state. In the present pasta calculations\nspin-orbit forces are not included but will be added in the future. Within the\nMADNESS framework, we can successfully perform calculations of inhomogeneous\nnuclear matter. By using pasta configurations from IUMD it is possible to\nexplore different geometries and test the impact of self-consistent\ncalculations on the latter.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables; additional section about spin-orbit\n  impact on the shape of the pasta phase"]}]

We demonstrate that the already inefficient relaxation of the exciton\npseudospin in such system can be suppressed even further by the application of\na tiny magnetic field of $\\sim$100 mT. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals the\npseudospin dynamics to be a two-step relaxation process. An initial decay of\nthe pseudospin occurs at the level of dark excitons on a time scale of 100 ps,\nwhich is tunable with a magnetic field. This decay is followed by even longer\ndecay ($>1$ ns), once the dark excitons form more complex objects allowing for\ntheir radiative recombination. Our finding of slow valley pseudospin relaxation\neasily manipulated by the magnetic field open new prospects for engineering the\ndynamics of the valley pseudospin in transition metal dichalcogenides.\n","Comment: Main text: 6 pages, 3 figures; Supplementary Information: 3 pages, 2\n  figures, 1 table"]}]

We also use the\nKullback-Leibler divergence as an alternative measure of inhomogeneity which\nreaffirms our findings. We show that the method presented here can effectively\ncapture the inhomogeneity in a truly inhomogeneous distribution at all length\nscales. We analyze a set of Monte Carlo simulations with certain periodicity in\ntheir spatial distributions and find periodic variations in their inhomogeneity\nwhich helps us to identify the underlying regularities present in such\ndistributions and quantify the scale of their periodicity.

In this paper we\nexplore, using both analytical and numerical approaches to a paradigmatic one\ndimensional model, the effect of a simple class of perturbations. We call them\n\"internal local perturbations\" in that the particle energies are perturbed at\ncollisions in a way which depends only on the local properties. Our central\nfinding is that the effect of the perturbations is to drive all the very\ndifferent QSS we consider towards a unique QSS. The latter is thus independent\nof the initial conditions of the system, but determined instead by both the\nlong-range forces and the details of the perturbations applied. Thus in the\npresence of such a perturbation the long-range system evolves to a unique\nnon-equilibrium stationary state, completely different to its state in absence\nof the perturbation, and it remains in this state when the perturbation is\nremoved.

Adding modest amounts\nof rotation to a stellar model that ignores rotation during the evolutionary\nstage, however, has little impact on the character of resulting convection.\nSince the spatial scale and strength of convection present at the point of core\ncollapse directly influence the supernova mechanism, our results suggest that\nrotation could play an important role in setting the stage for massive stellar\nexplosions.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The sample under study contains 416 galaxies observed with IFS,\ncovering a wide range of Hubble types and stellar masses. Spectral synthesis\ntechniques are applied to obtain radial profiles of the intensity of the star\nformation rate in the recent past, and the local sSFR. To emphasize the\nbehavior of these properties for galaxies that are on and off the main sequence\nof star formation (MSSF) we stack the individual radial profiles in bins of\ngalaxy morphology and stellar masses. Our main results are: a) The intensity of\nSFR shows declining profiles that exhibit very little differences between\nspirals. The dispersion between the profiles is significantly smaller in late\ntype spirals. This confirms that the MSSF is a sequence of galaxies with nearly\nconstant intensity of SFR b) sSFR values scale with Hubble type and increase\nradially outwards, with a steeper slope in the inner 1 HLR. This behavior\nsuggests that galaxies are quenched inside-out, and that this process is faster\nin the central, bulge-dominated part than in the disks. c) As a whole, and at\nall radii, E and S0 are off the MSSF. d) Applying the volume-corrections for\nthe CALIFA sample, we obtain a density of star formation in the local Universe\nof 0.0105 Msun/yr/Mpc^{-3}.

For\nexample, they dominate the optical depth at short wavelengths and their\nsurfaces are the sites of many important chemical reactions such as the\nformation of water. Based on their aerodynamical properties (i.e., their strong\ndynamical coupling with the surrounding gas) it is often assumed that these\nsmall grains are well-mixed with the gas. Our goal is to study the vertical\n(re)distribution of grains taking into account settling, turbulent diffusion,\nas well as collisions with other dust grains. Assuming a fragmentation-limited\nbackground dust population, we developed a Monte Carlo approach that follows\nsingle monomers as they move through a vertical column of gas and become\nincorporated in different aggregates as they undergo sticking and fragmenting\ncollisions. We find that (sub)micron grains are not necessarily well-mixed\nvertically, but can become trapped in a thin layer with a scale-height that is\nsignificantly smaller than that of the gas. This collisional trapping occurs\nwhen the timescale for diffusion is comparable to or longer than the collision\ntimescale in the midplane and its effect is strongest when the most massive\nparticles in the size-distribution show significant settling. Based on\nsimulations and analytical considerations we conclude that for typical\ndust-to-gas ratios and turbulence levels, the collisional trapping of small\ngrains should be a relatively common phenomenon. The absence of trapping could\nthen indicate a low dust-to-gas ratio, possibly because a large portion of the\ndust mass has been removed through radial drift or is locked up in\nplanetesimals.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures; accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Exoplanet searches have demonstrated that giant planets are\npreferentially found around metal-rich stars and that their fraction increases\nwith the stellar mass. AIMS. During the past six years, we have conducted a\nradial velocity follow-up program of 166 giant stars, to detect substellar\ncompanions, and characterizing their orbital properties. Using this\ninformation, we aim to study the role of the stellar evolution in the orbital\nparameters of the companions, and to unveil possible correlations between the\nstellar properties and the occurrence rate of giant planets. METHODS. Using\nFEROS and CHIRON spectra, we have computed precision radial velocities and we\nhave derived atmospheric and physical parameters for all of our targets.\nAdditionally, velocities computed from UCLES spectra are presented here. By\nstudying the periodic radial velocity signals, we have detected the presence of\nseveral substellar companions. RESULTS. We present four new planetary systems\naround the giant stars HIP8541, HIP74890, HIP84056 and HIP95124.

It is already known that in a differentially rotating system, the\nuniform toroidal magnetic field is unstable due to a magnetorotational\ninstability (MRI) under a non-axisymmetric and vertical perturbation, while it\nis stable under a purely vertical perturbation. Contrary to the previous study,\nthis paper proposes an unstable mode completely confined to the equatorial\nplane, driven by the expansive nature of the magnetic pressure gradient force\nunder a non-uniform toroidal field. The basic nature of this growing eigenmode,\nto which we give a name \"magneto-gradient driven instability\", is studied using\nlinear analysis, and the corresponding nonlinear evolution is then investigated\nusing two-dimensional ideal MHD simulations. Although a single localized\nmagnetic field channel alone cannot provide sufficient Maxwell stress to\ncontribute significantly to the angular momentum transport, we find that the\nmode coupling between neighboring toroidal fields under multiple localized\nmagnetic field channels drastically generates a highly turbulent state and\nleads to the enhanced transport of angular momentum, comparable to the\nefficiency seen in previous studies on MRIs.

Present in the portion of the data cube\ncorresponding to the brightest part of the bow shock are emission lines of H2\nwith upper state energies ranging from ~6,000 K up to the dissociation energy\nof H2, ~50,000 K. Because of low signal-to-noise ratios, the highest excitation\nlines cannot be easily seen elsewhere in the observed region. However,\nexcitation temperatures, measured throughout much of the observed region using\nlines from levels as high as 25,000 K, are a strong function of upper level\nenergy, indicating that the very highest levels are populated throughout. The\nlevel populations in the brightest region are well fit by a two-temperature\nmodel, with 98.5% of the emitting gas at T=1800 K and 1.5% at T=5200 K. The\nbulk of the H2 line emission in HH7, from the 1,800 K gas, has previously been\nwell modeled by a continuous shock, but the 5,200 K component is inconsistent\nwith standalone standard continuous shock models. We discuss various possible\norigins for the hot component and suggest that this component is H2 newly\nreformed on dust grains and then ejected from them, presumably following\ndissociation of some of the H2 by the shock.\n"]}]

The flaring process is found to\ninvolve interaction between a small and a big loop and the accelerated\nparticles divided in roughly equal numbers between them. Precipitation of the\nelectrons from the small loop produced only weak thermal response because the\nloop volume was small, while the electrons trapped in the big loop lost most of\ntheir energy in the coronal part of the loop, which resulted in the coronal\nplasma heating but no or only weak chromospheric evaporation, and thus\nunusually weak soft X-ray emission. Energy losses of fast electrons in the big\ntenuous loop were slow resulting in the observed delay of the plasma heating.\nWe determined that the impulsively accelerated electron population had a beamed\nangular distribution in the direction of electric force along the magnetic\nfield of the small loop.

Along MAGIC, the MWL campaign included the Metsahovi radio\nobservatory, Bell and KVA optical telescopes and the Swift and AGILE\nsatellites. MAGIC observations span from March to May, 2008 for a total of 27.9\nhours, of which 19.4 hours remained after quality cuts. The light curve showed\nno significant variability. The differential VHE spectrum could be described\nwith a power-law function. Both results were similar to those obtained during\nthe discovery. Swift XRT observations revealed an X-ray flare, characterized by\na harder when brighter trend, as is typical for high synchrotron peak BL Lac\nobjects (HBL). Strong optical variability was found during the campaign, but no\nconclusion on the connection between the optical and VHE gamma-ray bands could\nbe drawn. The contemporaneous SED shows a synchrotron dominated source, unlike\nconcluded in previous work based on nonsimultaneous data, and is well described\nby a standard one zone synchrotron self Compton model. We also performed a\nstudy on the source classification. While the optical and X-ray data taken\nduring our campaign show typical characteristics of an HBL, we suggest, based\non archival data, that 1ES 1011+496 is actually a borderline case between\nintermediate and high synchrotron peak frequency BL Lac objects.\n","Comment: 13 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

We find that a protoplanetary disk that includes a dead zone\n(a region of low turbulence) has substantially more material in the inner parts\nof the disk, possibly allowing for in situ formation. For the dead zone to last\nthe entire lifetime of the disk requires the active layer surface density to be\nsufficiently small, <100 g/cm^2. Migration through a dead zone may be very slow\nand thus super-Earth formation followed by migration towards the star through\nthe dead zone is less likely. For fully turbulent disks, there is not enough\nmaterial for in situ formation. However, in this case, super-Earths can form\nfarther out in the disk and migrate inwards on a reasonable timescale. We\nsuggest that both of these formation mechanisms operate in different planetary\nsystems. This can help to explain the observed large range in densities of\nsuper-Earths because the formation location determines the composition.\nFurthermore, we speculate that super-Earths could have formed in the inner\nparts of our solar system and cleared the material in the region inside of\nMercury's orbit. The super-Earths could migrate through the gas disk and fall\ninto the Sun if the disk was sufficiently cool during the final gas disk\naccretion process.

The CCDC is a class of insulators whose\nband gap can be changed by cation doping. The gap becomes arched in an\nultrathin layer due to the space charge formed from metal-induced gap states.\nWith an appropriate combination of an arched gap and a bias voltage, NDR can be\nproduced in either spin channel. This mechanism is applicable to 2D and 3D\nultrathin junctions with a sufficiently small band gap that forms a large space\ncharge. It provides a new way of controlling the spin-dependent transport in\nspintronic devices by an electric field. A generalized Simmons formula for\ntunneling current through junction with an arched gap is derived to show the\ngeneral conditions under which ultrathin junctions may exhibit NDR.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures"]}]

However, in two\ndifferent classes of commonly used systems, this is often not the case. These\nclasses exhibit non-monotonic changes in their density profile slopes which we\ncall oscillations for short. We analyze these two unrelated classes separately.\nClass 1 consists of systems that have density oscillations and that are defined\nthrough their distribution function $f(E)$, or differential energy distribution\n$N(E)$, such as isothermal spheres, King profiles, or DARKexp, a theoretically\nderived model for relaxed collisionless systems. Systems defined through $f(E)$\nor $N(E)$ generally have density slope oscillations. Class 1 system\noscillations can be found at small, intermediate, or large radii but we focus\non a limited set of Class 1 systems that have oscillations in the central\nregions, usually at $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim -2$, where $r_{-2}$ is the largest\nradius where $d\\log(\\rho)/d\\log(r)=-2$. We show that the shape of their $N(E)$\ncan roughly predict the amplitude of oscillations. Class 2 systems which are a\nproduct of dynamical evolution, consist of observed and simulated galaxies and\nclusters, and pure dark matter halos. Oscillations in the density profile slope\nseem pervasive in the central regions of Class 2 systems. We argue that in\nthese systems, slope oscillations are an indication that a system is not fully\nrelaxed. We show that these oscillations can be reproduced by small\nmodifications to $N(E)$ of DARKexp. These affect a small fraction of systems'\nmass and are confined to $\\log(r/r_{-2})\\lesssim 0$. The size of these\nmodifications serves as a potential diagnostic for quantifying how far a system\nis from being relaxed.\n","Comment: accepted by the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics (JCAP)"]}]

In detail, we\nshow that both the fraction of gas that is dense, f_dense traced by HCN/CO, and\nthe rate at which dense gas forms stars, SFE_dense traced by IR/HCN, depend on\nenvironment in the galaxy. The sense of the dependence is that high surface\ndensity, high molecular gas fraction regions of the galaxy show high dense gas\nfractions and low dense gas star formation efficiencies. This agrees with\nrecent results for individual pointings by Usero et al. 2015 but using unbiased\nwhole-galaxy maps. It also agrees qualitatively with the behavior observed\ncontrasting our own Solar Neighborhood with the central regions of the Milky\nWay. The sense of the trends can be explained if the dense gas fraction tracks\ninterstellar pressure but star formation occurs only in regions of high density\ncontrast.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, ApJL accepted"]}]

The method uses mass moments of the shear or flexion\nfields in combination with convergence information derived from number counts\nwhich exploit the magnification bias. The difference between the measured mass\nmoments provides an estimator for the magnitude of the additive constant that\nis the mass-sheet.

This model uses as input magnetograms simulated with a\nsurface flux transport model fed with semi-synthetic records of emerging\nsunspot groups. We used statistical relationships between the properties of\nsunspot group emergence, such as the latitude, area, and tilt angle, and the\nsunspot cycle strength and phase to produce semi-synthetic sunspot group\nrecords starting in the year 1700. The semisynthetic records are fed into a\nsurface flux transport model to obtain daily simulated magnetograms that map\nthe distribution of the magnetic flux in active regions (sunspots and faculae)\nand their decay products on the solar surface. The magnetic flux emerging in\nephemeral regions is accounted for separately based on the concept of extended\ncycles whose length and amplitude are linked to those of the sunspot cycles\nthrough the sunspot number. The magnetic flux in each surface component\n(sunspots, faculae and network, and ephemeral regions) was used to compute the\nspectral and total solar irradiance between the years 1700 and 2009.

This\nnon-accidental mutation is non-Lamarckian yet useful for evolution, and is due\nto evolved and continually evolving mutational mechanisms operating in the germ\ncells.

This paper aims to address this question by\narguing the following. Mutational mechanisms can be broadly construed as\nenacting local simplification operations on the DNA in germ cells, along with\ngene duplication. The joint action of these mutational operations and natural\nselection provides simplification under performance pressure. This joint action\ncreates from preexisting biological interactions new elements that have the\ninherent capacity to come together into unexpected useful interactions with\nother such elements, thus explaining nature's tendency for cooption. Novelty\nthus arises not from a local genetic accident but from gradual network-level\nevolution. Many empirical observations are explained from this perspective,\nfrom cooption and gene fusion at the molecular level, to the evolution of\nbehavior and instinct at the organismal level.

This model statistically\nreproduces the Galactic emission measure distribution as obtained independently\nfrom $H_\\alpha$ data well.\n  We find that at the lowest frequencies ($\\sim10-50$ MHz), the observed\nspectral index for a large segment of the Galaxy below Galactic latitudes of\n$\\lesssim15^\\circ$ could be changed significantly (i.e.,\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{EM}\\gtrsim0.1$).\n  This method therefore provides a correction to low-frequency spectral index\nmeasurements of extragalactic sources, and provides a sensitive probe of the\nthermal electron distribution of the Galaxy using current and next-generation\nlow-frequency radio telescopes.\n  We show that this effect should be robustly detectable individually in the\nstrongest sources, and statistically in source samples at a level of\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{EM}\\gtrsim0.18,0.06$, and 0.02 for source densities of 10, 100\nand 1,000 sources per square degree.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 10 figures, accepted to MNRAS on 17-05-2016"]}]

When a source-drain bias potential is\npresent, the current flowing to the left and right leads can either be\nattenuated or amplified depending on the sign of the gate potential. The\nresponse of the current to a dynamically changing gate potential is not\ninstantaneous. In the case when the gate potential is in the form of a step\nfunction, the current takes time to react, overshoots to a maximum value, and\nthen oscillates down to a steady-state value.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures"]}]
