By analyzing the interactions between Eguchi-Hanson\nmanifolds with opposite orientation, we identify a non-vanishing obstruction to\nthe gluing problem, thereby destroying any hope of producing a metric of zero\nRicci curvature in this way. Using this obstruction, we are able to understand\nthe dynamics of such metrics under Ricci flow as long as the Eguchi-Hanson\nmanifolds remain small.

This offline attacker is\nlimited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password.\nKey-stretching tools can help mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making\neach password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify. However,\nkey-stretching increases authentication costs for a legitimate authentication\nserver. We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model which captures the\nessential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline\nattacker. We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash (CASH), a randomized\nkey-stretching mechanism that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be\ncracked by a rational offline attacker without increasing amortized\nauthentication costs for the legitimate authentication server. CASH is\nmotivated by the observation that the legitimate authentication server will\ntypically run the authentication procedure to verify a correct password, while\nan offline adversary will typically use incorrect password guesses. By using\nrandomization we can ensure that the amortized cost of running CASH to verify a\ncorrect password guess is significantly smaller than the cost of rejecting an\nincorrect password. Using our Stackelberg game framework we can quantify the\nquality of the underlying CASH running time distribution in terms of the\nfraction of passwords that a rational offline adversary would crack. We provide\nan efficient algorithm to compute high quality CASH distributions for the\ndefender. Finally, we analyze CASH using empirical data from two large scale\npassword frequency datasets.

The main idea\nis to allow variables in the query and bind the variables to values when\nevaluating the query. For query languages that bind variables only once, query\nevaluation is usually NP-complete. There are query languages that allow binding\ninside the scope of Kleene star operators, which can themselves be in the scope\nof bindings and so on.

An invariant cluster for an ordinary\ndifferential equation (ODE) is a multivariate polynomial invariant g(u,x)=0,\nparametric in u, which can yield an infinite number of concrete invariants by\nassigning different values to u so that every trajectory of the system can be\noverapproximated precisely by a union of concrete invariants. For semialgebraic\nsystems, which involve ODEs with multivariate polynomial vector flow, invariant\nclusters can be obtained by first computing the remainder of the Lie derivative\nof a template multivariate polynomial w.r.t. its Groebner basis and then\nsolving the system of polynomial equations obtained from the coefficients of\nthe remainder. Based on invariant clusters and sum-of-squares (SOS)\nprogramming, we present a new method for the safety verification of hybrid\nsystems. Experiments on nonlinear benchmark systems from biology and control\ntheory show that our approach is effective and efficient.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"]}]

Up to now silicene can\nonly be epitaxially synthesized on a supporting substrate such as Ag(111). Even\nthough the structural and electronic properties of these epitaxial silicene\nlayers have been intensively studied, very little is known about its\nvibrational characteristics. Here, we present a detailed study of epitaxial\nsilicene on Ag(111) using \\textit{in situ} Raman spectroscopy, which is one of\nthe most extensively employed experimental techniques to characterize 2D\nmaterials, such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and black\nphosphorous. The vibrational fingerprint of epitaxial silicene, in contrast to\nall previous interpretations, is characterized by three distinct phonon modes\nwith A and E symmetries. The temperature dependent spectral evolution of these\nmodes demonstrates unique thermal properties of epitaxial silicene and a\nsignificant electron-phonon coupling. These results unambiguously support the\npurely two-dimensional character of epitaxial silicene up to about\n$300^{\\circ}C$, whereupon a 2D-to-3D phase transition takes place.\n"]}]

As a potential\nremedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum\nmechanics, in which the wavefunction plays no role [Phys. Rev. X, 4, 040002\n(2014)]. Quantum states are represented as ensembles of trajectories, whose\nmutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed in\nnature---suggesting a \"many interacting worlds\" interpretation. It is shown\nthat the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulation\nresults in well-behaved free-particle Gaussian wavepacket solutions. In\nparticular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, and\nits spatial integral is conserved over time---in any inertial frame. Finally,\nthe ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path through\nspacetime. In this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativistic\nquantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 27 figures; talk presented at the 3rd International\n  Symposium on \"Emergent Quantum Mechanics\" (Vienna, Austria, 23-25 October,\n  2015) in http://www.emqm15.org/ ; published in J.
