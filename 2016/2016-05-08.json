There have been detected non-coherent\ncomplex-periodic components localized at the frequencies of gravity-wave impact\nof binary stars and at the frequency of axion-photon interaction. These\ncomponents cannot be detected by means of quadrature scheme of spectral\nanalysis and have RMS values from 0.05 V/m to 0.5 V/m at binary stars\ngravity-wave impact frequencies and from 0.7 V/m to 2.7 V/m at axion-photon\ninteraction frequency. It was also demonstrated that the axion-photon\ninteraction frequency modulates the amplitude\n"]}]
