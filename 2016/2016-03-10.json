As a decentralized,\neasy to implement and empirically successful algorithm, BP deserves attention\nfrom the theoretical standpoint, and here not much is known at the present\nstage. In order to fill this gap we consider the performance of the BP\nalgorithm in the context of the capacitated minimum-cost network flow problem -\nthe classical problem in the operations research field. We prove that BP\nconverges to the optimal solution in the pseudo-polynomial time, provided that\nthe optimal solution of the underlying problem is unique and the problem input\nis integral. Moreover, we present a simple modification of the BP algorithm\nwhich gives a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for\nthe same problem, which no longer requires the uniqueness of the optimal\nsolution. This is the first instance where BP is proved to have\nfully-polynomial running time. Our results thus provide a theoretical\njustification for the viability of BP as an attractive method to solve an\nimportant class of optimization problems.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn as it is not up-to-date.

In this view, theories are\ndeclarative modellings, bags of information, descriptions of possible states of\naffairs. They are neither procedures nor descriptions of computational\nproblems. As such, the \\idp language and system preserve the fundamental idea\nof a declarative reading of logic programs, while they break with the\nfundamental idea of the procedural interpretation of logic programs.\n"]}]

Within\nsuch a simple scenario, inflation gracefully exits when the GR regime is\nrecovered, but the Universe would remain matter dominated. In order to\nimplement a reheating era after inflation, we then consider inflation to be\ndriven by a mixture of unstable dust species decaying into radiation. Because\nthe speed of sound gravitates within the Born-Infeld model under consideration,\nour scenario ends up being predictive on various open questions of the\ninflationary paradigm. The total number of e-folds of acceleration is given by\nthe lifetime of the unstable dust components and is related to the duration of\nreheating. As a result, inflation does not last much longer than the number of\ne-folds of deceleration allowing a small spatial curvature and large scale\ndeviations to isotropy to be observable today. Energy densities are\nself-regulated as inflation can only start for a total energy density less than\na threshold value, again related to the species' lifetime. Above this\nthreshold, the Universe may bounce thereby avoiding a singularity. Another\ndistinctive feature is that the accelerated expansion is of the\nsuperinflationary kind, namely the first Hubble flow function is negative.

At one extreme, it has been argued that neurons encode information\nin relatively slow changes of individual spikes arriving \"rates codes\" and the\nirregularity in the spike trains reflects noise in the system, while in the\nother extreme this irregularity is the temporal codes thus the precise timing\nof every spike carries additional information about the input. It is known that\nin the estimation of Shannon information the patterns and temporal structures\nare taken into account, while the rate code is determined by firing rate. We\ncompare these types of codes for binary Information Sources which model encoded\nspike-trains. Assuming that the information transmitted by a neuron is governed\nby uncorrelated stochastic process or by process with a memory we compare the\ninformation transmission rates carried by such spike-trains with their firing\nrates. We showed that the crucial role in the relation between information and\nfiring rates is played by a quantity which we call \"jumping\" parameter. It\ncorresponds to the probabilities of transitions from no-spike-state to the\nspike-state and vice versa. For low values of jumping parameter the quotient of\ninformation and firing rates is monotonically decreasing function of firing\nrate, thus there is straightforward, one-to-one, relation between temporal and\nrate codes. On the contrary, it turns out that for large enough jumping\nparameter this quotient is non-monotonic function of firing rate and it\nexhibits a global maximum, in this case optimal firing rate exists. Moreover,\nthere is no one-to-one relation between information and firing rates, so the\ntemporal and rate codes differ qualitatively.

Traditionally, neuronal sequences have been interpreted as noisy\nmanifestations of neuronal templates (i.e., orderings), ignoring much richer\nstructure contained in the sequences. This paper introduces a new tool for\nunderstanding neuronal sequences: the bias matrix. The bias matrix captures the\nprobabilistic tendency of each neuron to fire before or after each other\nneuron. Despite considering only pairs of neurons, the bias matrix captures the\nbest total ordering of neurons for a sequence (Proposition 3.3) and, thus,\ngeneralizes the concept of a neuronal template.\n  We establish basic mathematical properties of bias matrices, in particular\ndescribing the fundamental polytope in which all biases reside (Theorem 3.25).\nWe show how the underlying simple digraph of a bias matrix, which we term the\nbias network, serves as a combinatorial generalization of neuronal templates.\nSurprisingly, every simple digraph is realizable as the bias network of some\nsequence (Theorem 3.34). The bias-matrix representation leads us to a natural\nmethod for sequence correlation, which then leads to a probabilistic framework\nfor determining the similarity of one set of sequences to another.

A broadband image in the \\textit{H} band was reconstructed by combining\nthe data of all spectral channels using the SPARCO method. We spatially\nseparate all the building blocks of the IRAS08544-4431 system in our\nmilliarcsecond-resolution image. Our dissection reveals a dust sublimation\nfront that is strikingly similar to that expected in early-stage protoplanetary\ndisks, as well as an unexpected flux signal of $\\sim$4\\% from the secondary\nstar. The energy output from this companion indicates the presence of a compact\ncircum-companion accretion disk, which is likely the origin of the fast outflow\ndetected in H$\\alpha$. Our image provides the most detailed view into the heart\nof a dusty circumstellar disk to date. Our results demonstrate that binary\nevolution processes and circumstellar disk evolution can be studied in detail\nin space and over time.\n","Comment: PR @ http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1608/"]}]

Requests arrive in a\ncontinuous time online fashion at the points of $\\mathcal{M}$ and should be\nserved by matching them to each other. The algorithm is allowed to delay its\nrequest matching commitments, but this does not come for free: the total cost\nof the algorithm is the sum of metric distances between matched requests\n\\emph{plus} the sum of times each request waited since it arrived until it was\nmatched. A randomized online MPMD algorithm is presented whose competitive\nratio is $O (\\log^{2} n + \\log \\Delta)$, where $n$ is the number of points in\n$\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\Delta$ is its aspect ratio. The analysis is based on a\nmachinery developed in the context of a new stochastic process that can be\nviewed as two interleaved Poisson processes; surprisingly, this new process\ncaptures precisely the behavior of our algorithm. A related problem in which\nthe algorithm is allowed to clear any unmatched request at a fixed penalty is\nalso addressed. It is suggested that the MPMD problem is merely the tip of the\niceberg for a general framework of online problems with delayed service that\ncaptures many more natural problems.\n","Comment: An extended abstract will appear in Proceedings of ACM STOC 2016"]}]
