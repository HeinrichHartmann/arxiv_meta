The consistent\nhistories formalism is a tool for describing sequences of events taking place\nin an evolving closed quantum system. A set of histories is consistent when one\ncan reason about them using Boolean logic, i.e., when probabilities of\nsequences of events that define histories are additive. However, the vast\nmajority of the sets of histories that are merely consistent are flagrantly\nnon-classical in other respects. This embarras de richesses (known as the set\nselection problem) suggests that one must go beyond consistency to identify how\nthe classical past arises in our quantum Universe. The key intuition we follow\nis that the records of events that define the familiar objective past are\ninscribed in many distinct systems, e.g., subsystems of the environment, and\nare accessible locally in space and time to observers. We identify histories\nthat are not just consistent but redundantly consistent using the partial-trace\ncondition introduced by Finkelstein as a bridge between histories and\ndecoherence. The existence of redundant records is a sufficient condition for\nredundant consistency. It selects, from the multitude of the alternative sets\nof consistent histories, a small subset endowed with redundant records\ncharacteristic of the objective classical past.

We prove a general result: The dynamics of any deterministic nonlinear\ncellular automaton (CA) with $p$ possible dynamical states can be decomposed at\neach instant of time in a superposition of $N$ layers involving $p_{0}$,\n$p_{1}$,... $p_{N-1}$ dynamical states each, where the $p_{k\\in \\mathbb{N}}$,\n$k \\in [0, N-1]$ are divisors of $p$. If the divisors coincide with the prime\nfactors of $p$ this decomposition is unique. Conversely, we also prove that $N$\nCA working on symbols $p_{0}$, $p_{1}$,... $p_{N-1}$ can be composed to create\na graded CA rule with $N$ different layers. We then show that, even when the\nfull spatiotemporal evolution can be unpredictable, certain traits (layers) can\nexactly be predicted. We present explicit examples of such systems involving\ncompositions of Wolfram's 256 elementary CA and a more complex CA rule acting\non a neighborhood of two sites and 12 symbols and whose rule table corresponds\nto the smallest Moufang loop $M_{12}(S_{3},2)$.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures.

Here we develop a stochastic dynamical model on the DNA\nrenaturation. According to our model there are at least three steps in the\nrenaturation process viz. incorrect-contact formation, correct-contact\nformation and nucleation, and zipping. Most of the earlier two-state models\ncombined nucleation with incorrect-contact formation step. In our model we\nsuggest that it is considerably meaningful when we combine the nucleation with\nthe zipping since nucleation is the initial step of zipping and the nucleated\nand zipping molecules are indistinguishable. Incorrect-contact formation step\nis a pure three-dimensional diffusion controlled collision process. Whereas\nnucleation involves several rounds of one-dimensional slithering dynamics of\none single strand of DNA on the other complementary strand in the process of\nsearching for the correct-contact and then initiate nucleation. Upon\nnucleation, the stochastic zipping follows to generate a fully renatured double\nstranded DNA. It seems that the square-root dependency of the overall\nrenaturation rate constant on the length of reacting single strands originates\nmainly from the geometric constraints in the diffusion controlled\nincorrect-contact formation step. Further the inverse scaling of the\nrenaturation rate on the viscosity of the reaction medium also originates from\nthe incorrect-contact formation step. On the other hand the inverse scaling of\nthe renaturation rate with the sequence complexity originates from the\nstochastic zipping which involves several rounds of crossing over the\nfree-energy barrier at microscopic levels.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 2 figures"]}]

Since there exists a tunneling channel toward a\ntrivial geometry in the entire path integral, the entire information is encoded\nin the wave function. This demonstrates that the unitarity is preserved and\nthere is no loss of information when viewed from the entire wave function of\nthe universe, whereas a semi-classical observer, who can see only a definitive\ngeometry, would find an effective loss of information. This may provide a\nresolution to the information loss dilemma.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Quantum physicists consider Bells famous\ninequality and its violation in experiments to be a strong indication that\nlocal realistic or local causal models of QT are not possible and that quantum\ntheory as a whole is therefore not a local realistic or local causal theory.\nBased on a proposed definition of a \"formal causal model\" for a theory of\nphysics (such as QT), this paper investigates the possibility of having a local\ncausal model for QT. Areas of QT are identified in which the construction of a\ncausal model is impeded because of deficiencies in the state of the respective\ntheory. It is shown that the removal of the deficiencies can be achieved by the\nprovision of a causal model. Whereas the construction of a causal model of QT,\nincluding QFT, appears to be feasible after the removal of certain\ndeficiencies, the construction of a local (causal) model does not appear to be\npossible. As a consequence of the conclusion that local (causal) models of\nQT/QFT are not possible, if a strong interpretation of locality is assumed, a\nlocality model is proposed in which the non-localities are confined to \"quantum\nobjects\".\n"]}]

The approach is simplified\nby neglecting stress-assisted transverse barrier hopping, and irreversible\nrelaxation proceeds solely via deformation-perturbed reptation. This process is\nself-consistently coupled to tube dilation and macroscopic rheological\nresponse. We predict that with increasing strain the tube strongly dilates,\nentanglements are lost, and reptation speeds up. As a consequence, a stress\novershoot emerges not due to affine over-orientation, but rather to strong\nweakening of the entanglement network. Just beyond the stress overshoot the\nlongest relaxation time is predicted to scale as the inverse shear rate,\ncorresponding to the emergence of a generic form of convective constraint\nrelease (CCR). Its origin is a stress-induced local force that\nself-consistently couples the mesoscopic tube-scale physics with macroscopic\nmechanical response. Tube weakening at the overshoot occurs via the same\nqualitative mechanism that leads to microscopic absolute yielding in the\nnonlinear elastic scenario analyzed in the preceding paper. The stress\novershoot and emergent CCR thus correspond to an elastic-viscous crossover due\nto deformation-induced disentanglement, which at long times and high shear\nrates results in a quantitatively sensible flow stress plateau and shear\nthinning behavior. We suggest that the predicted behavior for needles is\nrelevant to flexible chain melts at low Rouse Weissenberg numbers if contour\nlength equilibration is fast. Quantitative predictions for tube dilation in the\nsteady state flow of chains melts are favorably compared to a recent\nsimulation.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures"]}]

A way proven to be effective is to give more weight to terms\nwith more imbalanced distributions across categories. This paper shows that\nsupervised term weighting should not just assign large weights to imbalanced\nterms, but should also control the trade-off between over-weighting and\nunder-weighting. Over-weighting, a new concept proposed in this paper, is\ncaused by the improper handling of singular terms and too large ratios between\nterm weights. To prevent over-weighting, we present three regularization\ntechniques: add-one smoothing, sublinear scaling and bias term. Add-one\nsmoothing is used to handle singular terms. Sublinear scaling and bias term\nshrink the ratios between term weights. However, if sublinear functions scale\ndown term weights too much, or the bias term is too large, under-weighting\nwould occur and harm the performance. It is therefore critical to balance\nbetween over-weighting and under-weighting. Inspired by this insight, we also\npropose a new supervised term weighting scheme, regularized entropy (re). Our\nre employs entropy to measure term distribution, and introduces the bias term\nto control over-weighting and under-weighting. Empirical evaluations on topical\nand sentiment classification datasets indicate that sublinear scaling and bias\nterm greatly influence the performance of supervised term weighting, and our re\nenjoys the best results in comparison with existing schemes.\n"]}]
