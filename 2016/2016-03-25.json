While accurate, the use of binary variables can cause problems when\nstudying large networks with many intersections. Instead, the signal control\ncan be approximated through a continuum approach where the on-and-off control\nvariable is replaced by a priority parameter. Advantages of such approximation\ninclude elimination of the need for binary variables, lower time resolution\nrequirements, and more flexibility and robustness in a decision environment.

Additionally, the GRB rate at\nhigh redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the early\nuniverse. While hundreds of GRBs are observed by Swift, it remains difficult to\ndetermine the intrinsic GRB rate due to the complex trigger algorithm of Swift.\nCurrent studies of the GRB rate usually approximate the Swift trigger algorithm\nby a single detection threshold. However, unlike the previously flown GRB\ninstruments, Swift has over 500 trigger criteria based on photon count rate and\nadditional image threshold for localization. To investigate possible systematic\nbiases and explore the intrinsic GRB properties, we develop a program that is\ncapable of simulating all the rate trigger criteria and mimicking the image\nthreshold. Our simulations show that adopting the complex trigger algorithm of\nSwift increases the detection rate of dim bursts. As a result, our simulations\nsuggest bursts need to be dimmer than previously expected to avoid\nover-producing the number of detections and to match with Swift observations.\nMoreover, our results indicate that these dim bursts are more likely to be high\nredshift events than low-luminosity GRBs. This would imply an even higher\ncosmic GRB rate at large redshifts than previous expectations based on\nstar-formation rate measurements, unless other factors, such as the luminosity\nevolution, are taken into account.

If\ndark matter populates the interior of stars, and this matter is supersymmetric\nor of some other type, some of it possessing a tiny electric charge, there is\nthe possibility that highly compact stars can trap a small but non-negligible\nelectric charge. In this case the radius to mass relation for such compact\nstars should get modifications. We use an analytical scheme to investigate the\nlimiting radius to mass relation and the maximum mass of relativistic stars\nmade of an incompressible fluid with a small electric charge. The investigation\nis carried out by using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation, i.e., the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, together with the other equations of\nstructure, with the further hypothesis that the charge distribution is\nproportional to the energy density. The approach relies on Volkoff and Misner's\nmethod to solve the TOV equation. For zero charge one gets the interior\nSchwarzschild limit, and supposing incompressible boson or fermion matter with\nconstituents with masses of the order of the neutron mass one gets that the\nmaximum mass is the Misner mass. For a small electric charge, our analytical\napproximating scheme valid in first order in the star's electric charge, shows\nthat the maximum mass increases relatively to the uncharged case, whereas the\nminimum possible radius decreases, an expected effect since the new field is\nrepulsive aiding the pressure to sustain the star against gravitational\ncollapse.\n","Comment: 23 pages, no figures"]}]

Specifically, intrinsic\nalignment correlations are sensitive to an anisotropic squeezed limit\nbispectrum of the primordial perturbations. Such a feature arises in solid\ninflation, as well as more broadly in the presence of light higher spin fields\nduring inflation (as pointed out recently by Arkani-Hamed and Maldacena). We\npresent a derivation of the all-sky two-point correlations of intrinsic shapes\nand number counts in the presence of non-Gaussianity with general angular\ndependence, and show that a quadrupolar (spin-2) anisotropy leads to the analog\nin galaxy shapes of the well-known scale-dependent bias induced in number\ncounts by isotropic (spin-0) non-Gaussianity. Moreover, in presence of non-zero\nanisotropic non-Gaussianity, the quadrupole of galaxy shapes becomes sensitive\nto far superhorizon modes. These effects come about because long-wavelength\nmodes induce a local anisotropy in the initial power spectrum, with which\ngalaxies will correlate. We forecast that future imaging surveys could provide\nconstraints on the amplitude of anisotropic non-Gaussianity that are comparable\nto those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

This makes\nit possible to hide the support set of the function by essentially removing\nsome variable from the support set of the function by selective assignment of\nhigh and low $V_t$ to the input transistors. We describe how a standard cell\nlibrary of TLGs can be mixed with conventional standard cells to realize\ncomplex logic circuits, whose function can never be discovered by reverse\nengineering. A 32-bit Wallace tree multiplier and a 28-bit 4-tap filter were\nsynthesized on an ST 65nm process, placed and routed, then simulated including\nextracted parastics with and without obfuscation. Both obfuscated designs had\nmuch lower area (25%) and much lower dynamic power (30%) than their\nnonobfuscated CMOS counterparts, operating at the same frequency.\n"]}]

In this work, we take a step\ntowards understanding what is a robust practice to extract and utilize\ncontextual information to facilitate object detection in practice.\nSpecifically, we consider the following two questions: \"how to identify useful\nglobal contextual information for detecting a certain object?\" and \"how to\nexploit local context surrounding a proposal for better inferring its\ncontents?\". We provide preliminary answers to these questions through\ndeveloping a novel Attention to Context Convolution Neural Network (AC-CNN)\nbased object detection model. AC-CNN effectively incorporates global and local\ncontextual information into the region-based CNN (e.g. Fast RCNN) detection\nmodel and provides better object detection performance. It consists of one\nattention-based global contextualized (AGC) sub-network and one multi-scale\nlocal contextualized (MLC) sub-network. To capture global context, the AGC\nsub-network recurrently generates an attention map for an input image to\nhighlight useful global contextual locations, through multiple stacked Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. For capturing surrounding local context, the\nMLC sub-network exploits both the inside and outside contextual information of\neach specific proposal at multiple scales. The global and local context are\nthen fused together for making the final decision for detection. Extensive\nexperiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 and VOC 2012 well demonstrate the superiority of\nthe proposed AC-CNN over well-established baselines.

Remarkably, myosin motors generate actin architectures, which in\nturn, force the emergence of ordered stress patterns. Reminiscent of second\norder phase transitions, the emergence of order is accompanied by a critical\nregime characterized by strongly enhanced strain fluctuations. The striking\ndynamics in the critical regime were revealed using fluorescent single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes as novel probes of cortical dynamics.\n"]}]

Theoretical analysis of\nreconstruction from the data $Xf$ is usually based on a study of the\ncomposition $X^* D X$, where $D$ is some local operator (usually a derivative).\nIf $X^*$ is chosen appropriately, then $X^* D X$ is a Fourier Integral Operator\n(FIO) with singular symbol. The singularity of the symbol leads to the\nappearance of artifacts (added singularities) that can be as strong as the\noriginal (or, useful) singularities. By choosing $D$ in a special way one can\nreduce the strength of added singularities, but it is impossible to get rid of\nthem completely.\n  In the paper we follow a similar approach, but make two changes. First, we\nreplace $D$ with a nonlocal operator $\\tilde D$ that integrates $Xf$ along a\ncurve in the data space. The result $\\tilde D Xf$ resembles the generalized\nRadon transform $R$ of $f$.

It turns out that if $\\tilde D$ and $R^*$\nare appropriately selected, then the composition $R^* \\tilde D X$ is an\nelliptic pseudodifferential operator of order zero with principal symbol 1.\nThus, we obtain an approximate reconstruction formula that recovers all the\nsingularities correctly and does not produce artifacts. The advantage of our\napproach is that by inserting $\\tilde D$ we get access to the frequency\nvariable $\\Theta$.

We construct a two-step presmoothing-and-resmoothing\nestimator of $f_1$ in the additive model and state finite-sample bounds for the\ndifference between our estimator and some smoothing estimators $\\tilde\nf_1^{\\text{oracle}}$ in the oracle model which satisfy mild conditions. In an\nasymptotic setting these bounds can be used to show asymptotic equivalence of\nour estimator and the oracle estimators; the paper thus shows that,\nasymptotically, under strong enough sparsity conditions, knowledge of\n$f_2,\\dots,f_q$ has no effect on estimation efficiency. Our first step is to\nestimate all of the components in the additive model with undersmoothing using\na group-Lasso estimator. We then construct pseudo responses $\\hat Y$ by\nevaluating a desparsified modification of our undersmoothed estimator of $f_1$\nat the design points. In the second step the smoothing method of the oracle\nestimator $\\tilde f_1^{\\text{oracle}}$ is applied to a nonparametric regression\nproblem with \"responses\" $\\hat Y$ and covariates $X_1$. Our mathematical\nexposition centers primarily on establishing properties of the presmoothing\nestimator. We also present simulation results demonstrating close-to-oracle\nperformance of our estimator in practical applications. The main results of the\npaper are also important for understanding the behavior of the presmoothing\nestimator when the resmoothing step is omitted.\n","Comment: 1 figure"]}]
