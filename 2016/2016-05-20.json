However, in practice the precise relationship\nbetween the signal x and the observations y_i may not follow the linear model,\nand in some cases it may not even be known.

We do not assume that the\ndependence is known. This is a form of the semiparametric single index model,\nand it includes the linear model as well as many forms of the generalized\nlinear model as special cases. We further assume that the signal x has some\nstructure, and we formulate this as a general assumption that x belongs to some\nknown (but arbitrary) feasible set K. We carefully detail the benefit of using\nthe signal structure to improve estimation. The theory is based on the mean\nwidth of K, a geometric parameter which can be used to understand its effective\ndimension in estimation problems. We determine a simple, efficient two-step\nprocedure for estimating the signal based on this model -- a linear estimation\nfollowed by metric projection onto K. We give general conditions under which\nthe estimator is minimax optimal up to a constant. This leads to the intriguing\nconclusion that in the high noise regime, an unknown non-linearity in the\nobservations does not significantly reduce one's ability to determine the\nsignal, even when the non-linearity may be non-invertible.

Their complexity often precludes analytic\nsolution, and we rely on stochastic simulation algorithms to estimate system\nstatistics. The Gillespie algorithm is exact, but computationally costly as it\nsimulates every single reaction. As such, approximate stochastic simulation\nalgorithms such as the tau-leap algorithm are often used. Potentially\ncomputationally more efficient, the system statistics generated suffer from\nsignificant bias unless tau is relatively small, in which case the\ncomputational time can be comparable to that of the Gillespie algorithm. The\nmulti-level method (Anderson and Higham, Multiscale Model. Simul. 2012) tackles\nthis problem. A base estimator is computed using many (cheap) sample paths at\nlow accuracy. The bias inherent in this estimator is then reduced using a\nnumber of corrections. Each correction term is estimated using a collection of\npaired sample paths where one path of each pair is generated at a higher\naccuracy compared to the other (and so more expensive). By sharing random\nvariables between these paired paths the variance of each correction estimator\ncan be reduced. This renders the multi-level method very efficient as only a\nrelatively small number of paired paths are required to calculate each\ncorrection term. In the original multi-level method, each sample path is\nsimulated using the tau-leap algorithm with a fixed value of $\\tau$.

The presence of period-tripling bifurcation points\nindicates regions of either chaos or confinement depending on the nature of the\nassociated manifold intersections. (2) The second type of bifurcation occurs\nwhen periodic lines become tangent to local or global invariant surfaces.

The condensations must be sufficiently massive, dense and\ncool to be gravitationally unstable, so that they start to contract; {\\it and}\nthey must then radiate away thermal energy fast enough for self-gravity to\nremain dominant, so that they continue to contract. For the metallicities and\ntemperatures in local star forming clouds, this second requirement is only met\nrobustly when the gas couples thermally to the dust, because this delivers the\ncapacity to radiate across the full bandwidth of the continuum, rather than\njust in a few discrete spectral lines. This translates into a threshold for\nvigorous star formation, which can be written as a minimum ram-pressure Pcrit ~\n4 10^-11 dyne. Pcrit is independent of temperature, and corresponds to flows\nwith molecular hydrogen number-density nH2 and velocity v satisfying nH2 v^2 >\n800 cm^-3 (km/s)^2.

In this\nstudy, thermal recovery mechanisms of both neutron and alpha-particle\nirradiated uranium dioxide lattice is investigated by atomistic simulation\nmethods. Isochronal and isothermal annealing have been applied to the\nirradiated samples. Following the same procedures of the experimental groups,\nactivation energies are calculated with molecular dynamics simulations and\ncompared with empirical data which show a good agreement. Migration energy\nbarrier and the recovery energies of the obstruction type defects are\ncalculated with molecular dynamics simulation and density functional theory.\nRecovery stages of the irradiated crystals are discussed however unlike the\npredictions of the most experimental groups, it is shown that neutron and\nalpha-particle irradiated crystal structures do not thermally recover for the\nsame reason. All three recovery stages of neutron irradiated uranium dioxide\ncrystal is attributed to oxygen interstitials while the three recovery stages\nof the alpha-particle irradiated crystals is considered to the oxygen -\nuranium, uranium and uranium interstitial defects respectively. Finally, the\nreason and the main driving force of thermal recovery of irradiated crystals is\nthe obstruction type defects which give a lead to all other types of defects\nrecover with themselves in each lattice recovery stages.\n","Comment: 25 Pages, 14 Figures"]}]
