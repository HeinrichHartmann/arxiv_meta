Next, we establish a\nJarnik type theorem for the set of multiplicatively approximable points on a\nnon-degenerate planar curve. This completes the Hausdorff theory for planar\ncurves. Finally, we show that the set of simultaneously inhomogeneously\n(i,j)-badly approximable points in the plane is of full dimension.

When a protein experiences a changed\nenvironment, it is under strong selection to find a peak in the new fitness\nlandscape. It has been shown that strong selection increases epistatic\ninteractions as well as the ruggedness of the fitness landscape, but little is\nknown about how the epistatic interactions change under selection in the\nlong-term evolution of a protein.

In this paper, a\nnovel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSI)\nis presented.

The presented\nNegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: the equilibrium-based framework for\nsparse interactions, the negotiation for the equilibrium set, the minimum\nvariance method for selecting one joint action and the knowledge transfer of\nlocal Q-values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared\nvalue functions, equilibrium solutions and sparse interactions are adopted to\nachieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational\ncomplexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI\nalgorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria:\nsteps of each episode (SEE), rewards of each episode (REE) and average runtime\n(AR). The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games\nand shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm.\nThen in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent\nwarehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the\npresented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL\nalgorithms.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 15 figures"]}]

While previous\nstudies emphasized the impact of feedback on dark matter profiles, we\ninvestigate the impact on the stellar component: kinematics, radial migration,\nsize evolution, and population gradients. Feedback-driven outflows/inflows\ndrive significant radial stellar migration over both short and long timescales\nvia two processes: (1) outflowing/infalling gas can remain star-forming,\nproducing young stars that migrate $\\sim1{\\rm\\,kpc}$ within their first $100\n{\\rm\\,Myr}$, and (2) gas outflows/inflows drive strong fluctuations in the\nglobal potential, transferring energy to all stars. These processes produce\nseveral dramatic effects. First, galaxies' effective radii can fluctuate by\nfactors of $>2$ over $\\sim200 {\\rm\\,Myr}$, and these rapid size fluctuations\ncan account for much of the observed scatter in radius at fixed $M_{\\rm star}.$\nSecond, the cumulative effects of many outflow/infall episodes steadily heat\nstellar orbits, causing old stars to migrate outward most strongly. This\nage-dependent radial migration mixes---and even inverts---intrinsic age and\nmetallicity gradients. Thus, the galactic-archaeology approach of calculating\nradial star-formation histories from stellar populations at $z=0$ can be\nseverely biased. These effects are strongest at $M_{\\rm\nstar}\\approx10^{7-9.6}{\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, the same regime where feedback most\nefficiently cores galaxies. Thus, detailed measurements of stellar kinematics\nin low-mass galaxies can strongly constrain feedback models and test baryonic\nsolutions to small-scale problems in $\\Lambda$CDM.\n","Comment: Accepted to ApJ (820, 131) with minor revisions from v1.

They were obtained in a unique environment for\nstudying QCD matter at temperatures and densities that exceed the limits\nwherein hadrons can exist as individual entities and raises to prominence the\nquark-gluon degrees of freedom. These findings are supported by major\nexperimental observations via measuring of the bulk properties of particle\nproduction, particle ratios and chemical freeze-out conditions, and elliptic\nflow; followed by hard probe measurements. The results reveal that a dense,\nstrongly-interacting medium is created in central Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV\nat RHIC. This revelation of a new state of nuclear matter has also been\nobserved in measurements at the LHC. Further, the IP-Glasma model coupled with\nviscous hydrodynamic models, which assumes the formation of a QGP, reproduces\nwell the experimental flow results from Au+Au at 200 GeV. This implies that the\nfluctuations in the initial geometry state are important and the created medium\nbehaves as a nearly perfect liquid of nuclear matter because it has an\nextraordinarily low ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. However, these\ndiscoveries are far from being fully understood.

Recently there has been an proliferation of\nnew policy-evaluation algorithms that fill a longstanding algorithmic void in\nreinforcement learning: combining robustness to off-policy sampling, function\napproximation, linear complexity, and temporal difference (TD) updates. This\npaper contains two main contributions. First, we derive two new hybrid TD\npolicy-evaluation algorithms, which fill a gap in this collection of\nalgorithms. Second, we perform an empirical comparison to elicit which of these\nnew linear TD methods should be preferred in different situations, and make\nconcrete suggestions about practical use.\n","Comment: Autonomous Agents and Multi-agent Systems, 2016"]}]

We present a general analytical theory of\nthe dynamics of radiation pressure-driven, optically thick winds. Unlike the\nclassical adiabatic stellar wind solution whose dynamics are solely determined\nby the sonic radius, here the loss of the radiation pressure due to photon\ndiffusion also plays an important role. We identify two high mass loss rate\nregimes ($\\dot{M} > L_{\\rm Edd\\,}/c^2$). In the large total luminosity regime\nthe solution resembles an adiabatic wind solution. Both the radiative\nluminosity, $L$, and the kinetic luminosity, $L_k$, are super-Eddington with $L\n< L_k$ and $L \\propto L_k^{1/3}$. In the lower total luminosity regime most of\nthe energy is carried out by the radiation with $L_k < L \\approx L_{\\rm\nEdd\\,}$. In a third, low mass loss regime ($\\dot{M} < L_{\\rm Edd\\,}/c^2$), the\nwind becomes optically thin early on and, unless gas pressure is important at\nthis stage, the solution is very different from the adiabatic one. The results\nare independent from the energy generation mechanism at the foot of the wind,\ntherefore they are applicable to a wide range of mass ejection systems, from\nblack hole accretion, to planetary nebulae, and to classical novae.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, MNRAS accepted, corrected proof"]}]

However, parallel software frameworks\ncontain inherent semantic information that general purpose compilers are not\ndesigned to exploit.\n  This paper presents a case study demonstrating how the specific semantic\ninformation of the MapReduce paradigm can be exploited on multicore\narchitectures. MR4J has been implemented in Java and evaluated against\nhand-optimized C and C++ equivalents. The initial observed results led to the\ndesign of a semantically aware optimizer that runs automatically without\nrequiring modification to application code.\n  The optimizer is able to speedup the execution time of MR4J by up to 2.0x.\nThe introduced optimization not only improves the performance of the generated\ncode, during the map phase, but also reduces the pressure on the garbage\ncollector. This demonstrates how semantic information can be harnessed without\nsacrificing sound software engineering practices when using parallel software\nframeworks.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

Fr\\\"{o}hlich at the 1994 Les\nHouches summer school. It is devoted to a sketchy exposition of some of the\nbeautiful and important, recent results of J.Feldman and E.Trubowitz, and J.\nFeldman, H. Kn\\\"{o}rrer, D. Lehmann, J. Magnen, V. Rivasseau and E. Trubowitz.\nTheir results are about a mathematical analysis of non-relativistic many-body\ntheory, in particular of the Landau-Fermi liquid and BCS superconductivity,\nusing Wilson's renormalization group methods and the techniques of the\n$1/N$-expansion. While their work is ultimately aimed at a complete\nmathematical control (beyond perturbative expansions) of systems of weakly\ncoupled electron gases at positive density and small or zero temperature, we\ncan only illustrate some of their ideas within the context of perturbative\nsolutions of Wilson-type renormalization group flow equations (we calculate\nleading-order terms in a $1/N$-expansion, where $N$ is an energy scale) and of\none-loop effective potential calculations of the BCS superconducting ground\nstate.
