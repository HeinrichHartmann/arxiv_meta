A similar\nprocess has recently also been seen in simplified (e.g., isothermal) models of\nflux concentrations from the negative effective magnetic pressure instability.\nWe study the effects of partial ionization near the radiative surface on the\nformation of such magnetic flux concentrations. We first obtain one-dimensional\n(1D) equilibrium solutions using either a Kramers-like opacity or the ${\\rm\nH}^{-}$ opacity. The resulting atmospheres are then used as initial conditions\nin two-dimensional (2D) models where flows are driven by an imposed gradient\nforce resembling a localized negative pressure in the form of a blob. To\nisolate the effects of partial ionization and radiation, we ignore turbulence\nand convection. In 1D models, due to partial ionization, an unstable\nstratification forms always near the surface. We show that the extrema in the\nspecific entropy profiles correspond to the extrema in degree of ionization. In\nthe 2D models without partial ionization, flux concentrations form close to the\nheight where the blob is placed. In models with partial ionization, such flux\nconcentrations form at the surface much above the blob. This is due to the\ncorresponding unstable layer in specific entropy. With ${\\rm H}^{-}$ opacity,\nflux concentrations are weaker due to the stably stratified deeper parts. We\ndemonstrate that, together with density stratification, the imposed source of\nnegative pressure drives the formation of flux concentrations. We find that the\ninclusion of partial ionization affects entropy profiles causing the strong\nflux concentrations to form closer to the surface.

The drawback of this\nassumption is that it does not cater for randomized assignments or allocation\nof time-shares. Recently, house allocation with fractional endowment of houses\nwas considered by Athanassoglou and Sethuraman (2011) who posed the open\nproblem of generalizing Gale's Top Trading Cycles (TTC) algorithm to the case\nof housing markets with fractional endowments.

Generalizing previous works, we discuss four\nmodel-independent analytical parameterizations for $X$, consisting of sigmoid\nfunctions composed with elementary functions of the energy and three distinct\nasymptotic scenarios: either the standard black disk limit or scenarios above\nor below that limit.

However the larger the\nseparation, the more difficult it is to produce a given magnetic field in the\nplasma region, so plasma configurations should be chosen that can be supported\nas efficiently as possible by distant coils. The efficiency of an\nexternally-generated magnetic field is a measure of the field's shaping\ncomponent magnitude at the plasma compared to the magnitude near the coils; the\nefficiency of a plasma equilibrium can be measured using the efficiency of the\nrequired external shaping field. Counterintuitively, plasma shapes with low\ncurvature and spectral width may have low efficiency, whereas plasma shapes\nwith sharp edges may have high efficiency. Two precise measures of magnetic\nfield efficiency, which correctly identify such differences in difficulty, will\nbe examined.

In this\nthesis we have studied the zero temperature quenching dynamics of different\nIsing spin systems. First we have studied the zero temperature quenching\ndynamics of two dimensional Ising spin system with competating interactions.\nThen we have studied the effect of randomness or disorder on the quenching\ndynamics of Ising spin system. We have studied the effect of the nature of\nrandomness on zero temperature quenching dynamics of one dimensional Ising\nmodel on two type of complex networks. A model for opinion dynamics also has\nbeen proposed in this thesis, in which the binary opinions of the individuals\nare determined according to the size of their neighboring domains. This model\ncan be equivalently defined in terms of Ising spin variables and the various\nquantities studied have one to one correspondence with magnetic systems.\nIntroducing disorder in this model through a parameter called rigidity\nparameter $\\rho$ (probability that people are completely rigid and never change\ntheir opinion), the transition to a heterogeneous society at $\\rho = 0^{+}$ is\nobtained.

First, to assess\nthe applicability of SAL to this kind of data, and second, to analyze the role\nof external object identification algorithms (OIA) and the effects of\nobservational uncertainties on the resulting scores.\n  As a feature based method, SAL requires external OIA.

The mathematical\nstructure of these indicators connects the sensitivity of the SAL scores to\nparameter changes with the effect of observational uncertainties.\n  Finally, the discriminating power of SAL is studied.

Bayesian optimization\nis a sample efficient optimization algorithm that is especially suitable for\nthis setups as it actively reduces the number of trials for learning about the\nfunction to optimize. In fact, this active object exploration is the same\nstrategy that infants do to learn optimal grasps. One problem that arises while\nlearning grasping policies is that some configurations of grasp parameters may\nbe very sensitive to error in the relative pose between the object and robot\nend-effector. We call these configurations unsafe because small errors during\ngrasp execution may turn good grasps into bad grasps.

We propose a new\nalgorithm, Unscented Bayesian optimization that is able to perform sample\nefficient optimization while taking into consideration input noise to find safe\noptima. The contribution of Unscented Bayesian optimization is twofold as if\nprovides a new decision process that drives exploration to safe regions and a\nnew selection procedure that chooses the optimal in terms of its safety without\nextra analysis or computational cost. Both contributions are rooted on the\nstrong theory behind the unscented transformation, a popular nonlinear\napproximation method.

Meaning if we denote x the point in space and t as point in time; then\nthe differentials dx (and dt) cannot be taken to limit zero, rather it has\nspread. A way to take this into account is to use infinitesimal quantities as\n(\\Deltax)^\\alpha (and (\\Deltat)^\\alpha) with 0<\\alpha<1, which for very-very\nsmall \\Deltax (and \\Deltat); that is trending towards zero, these 'fractional'\ndifferentials are greater that \\Deltax (and \\Deltat).

To help clarify this dependency, we numerically simulate the\neffects of a batch stirring device on a 2D incompressible Newtonian fluid in\nthe laminar regime. In particular, we calculate the finite time Lyapunov\nexponent (FTLE) field for three different stirring protocols, one topologically\ncomplex (pseudo-Anosov) and two simple (finite-order), over a range of\nviscosities. After extracting appropriate measures indicative of both the\namount of mixing and the area of effective mixing from the FTLE field, we see a\nclearly defined Reynolds number range in which the relative efficacy of the\npseudo-Anosov protocol over the finite-order protocols justifies the\napplication of topological chaos. More unexpectedly, we see that while the\nmeasures of effective mixing area increase with increasing Reynolds number for\nthe finite-order protocols, they actually exhibit non-monotonic behavior for\nthe pseudo-Anosov protocol.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

A single\nnon-degenerate Majorana zero mode, therefore, does not couple to an applied\nmagnetic field, except via hybridization with higher energy excited states (if\npresent), which may perturb its wave function. If `spin' is defined by\nconsidering only the particle components of the wave function, as has been done\nin some recent works, Majorana zero modes do have a non-zero spatial profile of\nthis quantity, measurable in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments.\nHowever, if such a quantity is measured in spin-resolved tunneling experiments\n(without spatial resolution), we show that it cannot be used as a unique\nsignature of Majorana zero modes in the topologically non-trivial\nsuperconducting phase.
