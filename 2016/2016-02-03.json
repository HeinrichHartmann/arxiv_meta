We show that whereas\nthe polarization fraction and position angle of the X-rays are similar to those\nof the NIR component for synchrotron-cooled emission, these quantities are\nmeasurably different when the X-rays emerge from a scattering medium. It is\nclear, therefore, that the development of X-ray polarimetry will represent a\nmajor new tool for studying the spacetime near supermassive black holes.\n","Comment: Accepted for Publication in MNRAS, September 26, 2011"]}]

Our goal is to understand an\nopen part of L_K(M) as a Lagrangian in the symplectic space of framed flat\nconnections on the boundary, and as a K_2-Lagrangian, meaning that the\nK_2-avatar of the symplectic form restricts to zero.

In uniform magnetic fields\nand over-dense plasma structures, where $C_A$ is smaller than in the\nsurrounding plasma, the flow, which is confined to the structure and going in\nthe same direction as the AW, reduces the effect of phase-mixing, because on\nthe edges of the structure $C_A^\\prime$ and $V_0^\\prime$ have opposite signs.\nThus, the wave damps by means of slower phase-mixing compared to the case\nwithout the flow.

Building on the iHOD framework developed by Zu &\nMandelbaum (2015a), we consider two quenching scenarios: 1) a \"halo\" quenching\nmodel in which halo mass is the sole driver for turning off star formation in\nboth centrals and satellites; and 2) a \"hybrid\" quenching model in which the\nquenched fraction of galaxies depends on their stellar mass while the satellite\nquenching has an extra dependence on halo mass. The two best-fit models\ndescribe the red galaxy clustering and lensing equally well, but halo quenching\nprovides significantly better fits to the blue galaxies above $10^{11}\nM_\\odot/h^2$. The halo quenching model also correctly predicts the average halo\nmass of the red and blue centrals, showing excellent agreement with the direct\nweak lensing measurements of locally brightest galaxies. Models in which\nquenching is not tied to halo mass, including an age-matching model in which\ngalaxy colour depends on halo age at fixed $M_*$, fail to reproduce the\nobserved halo mass for massive blue centrals.

This causes a\nlarge bulge in the propagator at small momentum. Mass is defined through\n$m^{-2}=\\Delta (p=0)$, where $\\Delta(p)$ is the scalar function for the gluon\npropagator in some chosen gauge, it is not a pole mass and is generally\ngauge-dependent, except in the gauge-invariant Pinch Technique (PT). We\ntruncate the PT equations with a new method called the vertex paradigm that\nautomatically satisfies the QED-like Ward identity relating the 3-gluon PT\nvertex function with the PT propagator. The mass is determined by a homogeneous\nBethe-Salpeter equation involving this vertex and propagator. This gap equation\nalso encapsulates the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the massless scalar\nexcitations, essentially Nambu-Goldstone fields, that necessarily accompany\ngauge-invariant gluon mass. The problem is to find a good approximate value for\n$m$ and at the same time explain the bulge, which by itself leads, in the gap\nequation for the gluon mass, to excessively large values for the mass. Our\npoint is not to give a high-accuracy determination of $m$ but to clarify the\nway in which the propagator bulge and a fairly accurate estimate of $m$ can\nco-exist, and we use various approximations that illustrate the underlying\nmechanisms. The most critical point is to satisfy the Ward identity. In the PT\nwe estimate a gauge-invariant dynamical gluon mass of $m \\approx Ng^2/(2.48\n\\pi)$. We translate these results to the Landau gauge using a\nbackground-quantum identity involving a dynamical quantity $\\kappa$ such that\n$m=\\kappa m_L$, where $m_L^{-2}\\equiv \\Delta_L(p=0)$. Given our estimates for\n$m,\\kappa$ the relation is fortuitously well-satisfied for $SU(2)$ lattice\ndata.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Using data from the\nFourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) in combination with far-IR imaging\nfrom the Spitzer and Herschel observatories we measure the SFR-M* relation at\n0.5 < z < 4. Similar to recent works we find that the average infrared SEDs of\ngalaxies are roughly consistent with a single infrared template across a broad\nrange of redshifts and stellar masses, with evidence for only weak deviations.\nWe find that the SFR-M* relation is not consistent with a single power-law of\nthe form SFR ~ M*^a at any redshift; it has a power-law slope of a~1 at low\nmasses, and becomes shallower above a turnover mass (M_0) that ranges from\n10^9.5 - 10^10.8 Msol, with evidence that M_0 increases with redshift. We\ncompare our measurements to results from state-of-the-art cosmological\nsimulations, and find general agreement in the slope of the SFR-M* relation\nalbeit with systematic offsets. We use the evolving SFR-M* sequence to generate\nSFHs, finding that typical SFRs of individual galaxies rise at early times and\ndecline after reaching a peak. This peak occurs earlier for more massive\ngalaxies. We integrate these SFHs to generate mass-growth histories and compare\nto the implied mass-growth from the evolution of the stellar mass function. We\nfind that these two estimates are in broad qualitative agreement, but that\nthere is room for improvement at a more detailed level. At early times the SFHs\nsuggest mass-growth rates that are as much as 10x higher than inferred from the\nstellar mass function.

Several new techniques to determine the metallicity of M dwarfs with\nbetter precision have been developed over the last decades. However, most of\nthese studies were based on empirical methods.

Aims. In this work we continue the reliability confirmation and\ndevelopment of metallicity determinations of M dwarfs using high- resolution\ninfrared spectra. The reliability was confirmed though analysis of M dwarfs in\nfour binary systems with FGK dwarf companions and by comparison with previous\noptical studies of the FGK dwarfs. Methods. The metallicity determination was\nbased on spectra taken in the J band (1.1-1.4 {\\mu}m) with the CRIRES\nspectrograph. In this part of the infrared, the density of stellar molecular\nlines is limited, reducing the amount of blends with atomic lines enabling an\naccurate continuum placement.

Using the estimated kinematics and true\nmasses of the CMEs, we have derived the coefficient of restitution for the\ncollision which is found to be close to elastic. The in situ measurements at 1\nAU show two distinct structures of interplanetary CMEs, heating of the\nfollowing CME, as well as ongoing interaction between the preceding and the\nfollowing CME.

In this\npaper, we present a study of the CLVI and CLVP in continuum spectra considering\ndifferent contributions of scattering and absorption opacity for different\nspectral type stars with spherical atmospheres. We solve the polarized\nradiative transfer equation in the presence of continuum scattering,\nconsidering spherical stellar model atmospheres. We developed two independent\ncodes based on Feautrier and short characteristics methods to cross-check our\nresults. We calculate the CLVI and CLVP in continuum for the Phoenix grid of\nspherical stellar model atmospheres for a range of $T_{eff} = 4000 - 7000 \\rm\nK$, $\\log g = 1.0 - 5.5$ and $\\lambda = 4000 - 7000 \\rm \\AA$, which are\ntabulated and available at the CDS. For sub-giant and dwarf stars ($\\log g =\n3.0 - 4.5$), lower $\\log g$ and lower $T_{eff}$ of a star lead to higher limb\npolarization of the star. For giant and supergiant stars ($\\log g = 1.0 -\n2.5$), the highest effective temperature yields the largest polarization. By\ndecreasing of the $T_{eff}$ of a star down to $4500 - 5500 \\rm K$ (depending on\n$\\log g$) the limb polarization decreases and reaches a local minimum. It\nincreases again down to $T_{eff}$ of $4000 \\rm K$.

Its topology was previously studied with the Zeeman\nDoppler imaging (ZDI) modelling of high-resolution circular polarisation\n(Stokes V) observations. Here we assess the robustness of the Stokes V ZDI\nreconstruction of the magnetic field geometry of tau Sco and explore the\nconsequences of using different parameterisations of the surface magnetic maps.\nWe succeeded in reproducing previously published magnetic field maps of tau Sco\nusing both general harmonic expansion and a direct, pixel-based representation\nof the magnetic field. These maps suggest that the field topology of tau Sco is\ncomprised of comparable contributions of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic\ncomponents. At the same time, we also found that available Stokes V\nobservations can be successfully fitted employing restricted harmonic\nexpansions, by either neglecting the toroidal field altogether or linking the\nradial and horizontal components of the poloidal field as required by the\nwidely used potential field extrapolation technique. These alternative\nmodelling approaches lead to a stronger and topologically more complex surface\nfield structure. The field distributions recovered with different ZDI options\ndiffer significantly, yielding indistinguishable Stokes V profiles but\ndifferent linear polarisation (Stokes Q and U) signatures. Our investigation\nunderscores the well-known problem of non-uniqueness of the Stokes V ZDI\ninversions. For the magnetic stars with properties similar to tau Sco\n(relatively complex field, slow rotation) the outcome of magnetic\nreconstruction depends sensitively on the adopted field parameterisation.\nStokes Q and U spectropolarimetric observations represent the only way of\nbreaking the degeneracy of surface magnetic field models.\n"]}]

The observed stellar groups display a broad spectrum of masses,\nsizes and other properties, so it is often assumed that there is no underlying\nstructure in this diversity. Here we show that the assumption of an\nunstructured multitude of cluster or association types might be misleading.\nCurrent data compilations of clusters show correlations between cluster mass,\nsize, age, maximum stellar mass etc. In this first paper we take a closer look\nat the correlation of cluster mass and radius. We use literature data to\nexplore relations in cluster and molecular core properties in the solar\nneighborhood. We show that for embedded clusters in the solar neighborhood\nthere exists a clear correlation between cluster mass and half-mass radius of\nthe form $M_c = C R_c^{\\gamma}$ with gamma = 1.7 +/-0.2. This correlation holds\nfor infra red K band data as well as X-ray sources and for clusters containing\na hundred stars up to those consisting of a few tens of thousands of stars. The\ncorrelation is difficult to verify for clusters containing <30 stars due to\nlow-number statistics. Dense clumps of gas are the progenitors of the embedded\nclusters. We find a similar slope for the mass-size relation of dense, massive\nclumps as for the embedded star clusters. This might point at a direct\ntranslation from gas to stellar mass: however, it is difficult to relate size\nmeasurements for clusters (stars) to those for gas profiles. Taking into\naccount multiple paths for clump mass into cluster mass, we obtain an average\nstar-formation efficiency of 18%{+9.3}{-5.7} for the embedded clusters in the\nsolar neighborhood. The derived mass-radius relation gives constraints for the\ntheory of clustered star formation.

By assuming that DL is the regulation mechanism for the\nstellar angular velocity during the early stages of pMS, we use our models and\nobservational data to constrain disk lifetimes (Tdisk) of a sample of low-mass\nstars in the ONC and NGC2264. The period distributions of the ONC and NGC2264\nare bimodal and depend on the stellar mass. To follow the rotational evolution\nof these two clusters' stars, we generated some sets of evolutionary tracks. We\nassumed that the evolution of fast rotators can be modeled by considering\nconservation of AM during all stages and of moderate rotators by considering\nconservation of angular velocity during the first stages of evolution. With\nthese models we estimate a mass and an age for all stars. For the ONC, we\nassume that the secondary peak in the period distribution is due to high-mass\nobjects locked in their disks, with a locking period (Plock) of ~8 days. For\nNGC2264 we make two hypotheses: (1) the stars in the secondary peak are locked\nwith Plock=5 days, and (2) NGC2264 is in a later stage in the rotational\nevolution (this implies in a DL scenario with Plock=8 days, a Tdisk of 1 Myr\nand, after that, constant AM evolution). We simulated the period distribution\nof NGC2264 when its mean age was 1 Myr. Dichotomy and bimodality appear in the\nsimulated distribution, presenting one peak at 2 days and another one at 5-7\ndays, indicating that the assumption of Plock=8 days is plausible. Our\nhypotheses are compared with observational disk diagnoses available in the\nliterature.

Nevertheless, after a detailed analysis of the\ndata, several interesting results were obtained that encouraged a dedicated\npublication. Methods. The methodology used was based on broad-band differential\nCCD photometry. This outburst of V404 Cygni rendered the source a very bright\ntarget easily within reach of small educational telescopes.

Such a scenario predicts the existence of an extended main sequence\nturn off (eMSTO) only in clusters with escape velocities above a certain\nthreshold ($>15$ km s$^{-1}$), which would allow them to retain or accrete gas\nthat eventually would fuel a secondary extended star-formation episode.

This scenario, however, faces major problems, in\nparticular the J-band brightening and the resurgence of FeH absorption at the L\nto T transition, and a physical first-principle understanding of this\ntransition is lacking. In this paper, we propose a new, completely different\nexplanation for BD and extrasolar giant planet (EGP) spectral evolution,\nwithout the need to invoke clouds. We show that, due to the slowness of the\nCO/CH4 and N2/NH3 chemical reactions, brown dwarf (L and T, respectively) and\nEGP atmospheres are subject to a thermo-chemical instability similar in nature\nto the fingering or chemical convective instability present in Earth oceans and\nat the Earth core/mantle boundary. The induced small-scale turbulent energy\ntransport reduces the temperature gradient in the atmosphere, explaining the\nobserved increase in near infrared J-H and J-K colors of L dwarfs and hot EGPs,\nwhile a warming up of the deep atmosphere along the L to T transition, as the\nCO/CH4 instability vanishes, naturally solves the two aforementioned puzzles,\nand provides a physical explanation of the L to T transition.

To construct such a heat map, we first\nreduce it to a problem called Region Coloring (RC), which divides the space\ninto disjoint regions within which all the points have the same RNN set. We\nthen propose a novel algorithm named CREST that efficiently solves the RC\nproblem by labeling each region with the heat value of its containing points.\nIn CREST, we propose innovative techniques to avoid processing expensive RNN\nqueries and greatly reduce the number of region labeling operations. We perform\ndetailed analyses on the complexity of CREST and lower bounds of the RC\nproblem, and prove that CREST is asymptotically optimal in the worst case.\nExtensive experiments with both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate that\nCREST outperforms alternative algorithms by several orders of magnitude.\n","Comment: Accepted to appear in ICDE 2016"]}]

Existing approaches to providing reliability for\nmemory devices pessimistically treat all data as equally vulnerable to memory\nerrors. Our key insight is that there exists a diverse spectrum of tolerance to\nmemory errors in new data-intensive applications, and that traditional\none-size-fits-all memory reliability techniques are inefficient in terms of\ncost. For example, we found that while traditional error protection increases\nmemory system cost by 12.5%, some applications can achieve 99.00% availability\non a single server with a large number of memory errors without any error\nprotection. This presents an opportunity to greatly reduce server hardware cost\nby provisioning the right amount of memory reliability for different\napplications.\n  Toward this end, in this paper, we make three main contributions to enable\nhighly-reliable servers at low datacenter cost. First, we develop a new\nmethodology to quantify the tolerance of applications to memory errors. Second,\nusing our methodology, we perform a case study of three new data-intensive\nworkloads (an interactive web search application, an in-memory key-value store,\nand a graph mining framework) to identify new insights into the nature of\napplication memory error vulnerability.

In this study, the methodology for arbitrary linear\nschemes to achieve the property is investigated. First, derivations of grid\nmetric by Thomas, Lombard and Neier are reviewed, through which linear schemes\nfor the metric and unsplit flux could attain the property by the proof of\nVinokur and Yee firstly. In practical applications, flux splittings are usually\nat presence and therefore the direct use of upwind schemes seems difficult to\nfulfill free-stream preservation. To overcome the difficulty, two attempts are\nmade: firstly, a central-scheme-decomposition is worked out, through which a\ncentral difference scheme is derived to approximate the first-order partial\nderivative in metric evaluations; secondly, treatments are proposed for flux\nsplitting and a concrete example is presented. Through these two attempts, the\nlinear upwind node schemes can achieve the property. For half-node or mixed\ntype schemes, interpolations should be used to derive variables at half nodes.\nAs a result, a directionally consistent interpolation is proposed, which is\nshown to be necessary in order to avoid violation of the metric identity and\nfree-stream preservation. Two numerical problems are also tested, i.e., the\nfree-stream and vortex preservation on wavy, largely randomized and triangular\ngrids. Numerical results validate aforementioned theoretical outcomes;\nespecially, simulations on the triangular grids indicate the methods discussed\nin this study, which are typical algorithms on structured grids, has the\napplication potential for problems on unstructured meshes.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7figures"]}]

Our\nmechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half\nof the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian\nmolecular profiles observed in wild-type plants. A set of those essential\ninteractions is called herein a kernel of the circadian system. The kernel\nstructure unbiasedly reveals four interlocked negative feedback loops\ncontributing to circadian rhythms, and three feedback loops among them drive\nthe autonomous oscillation itself. Strikingly, the kernel structure, as well as\nthe whole clock circuitry, is overwhelmingly composed of inhibitory, rather\nthan activating, interactions between genes. We found that this tendency\nunderlies plant circadian molecular profiles which often exhibit\nsharply-shaped, cuspidate waveforms. Through the generation of these cuspidate\nprofiles, inhibitory interactions may facilitate the global coordination of\ntemporally-distant clock events that are markedly peaked at very specific times\nof day.

However, on the other hand, the quasi-1D excitonic\nnature can limit the luminescence quantum yield significantly. Here, we report\nexciton brightening in monolayer phosphorene achieved via the dimensionality\nmodification of excitons from quasi-1D to zero-dimensional (0D), through the\ntransference of monolayer phosphorene samples onto defect-rich oxide substrate\ndeposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). The resultant\ninterfacial luminescent local states lead to exciton localization and trigger\nefficient photon emissions at a new wavelength of ~920 nm. The luminescence\nquantum yield of 0D-like localized excitons is measured to be at least 33.6\ntimes larger than that of intrinsic quasi-1D free excitons in monolayer\nphosphorene. This is primarily due to the reduction of non-radiative decay rate\nand the possibly enhanced radiative recombination probability. Owing to the\nlarge trapping energy, this new photon emission from the localized excitons in\nmonolayer phosphorene can be observed at elevated temperature, which contrasts\nmarkedly with defect-induced photon emission from transition metal\ndichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor monolayers that can only be observed at\ncryogenic temperatures. Our findings introduce new avenues for the development\nof novel photonic devices based on monolayer phosphorene, such as near-infrared\nlighting devices that are operable at elevated temperature. More importantly,\n2D phosphorene with quasi-1D free excitons and 0D-like localized excitons\nprovides a unique platform to investigate the fundamental phenomena in the\nideal 2D-1D-0D hybrid system.\n"]}]

The possibility of multiplet structures is also discussed.\nHowever, no consistency is found when the Time-Dependent Convection treatment\nis used for modes discrimination. The disagreement can be due to the large\nrotation velocity taking place in HD218427 and, consequently, the significant\ncoupling between the modes.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures.

Our data show, that\nthe scale length and height of a stellar population increases with age, with\nthe oldest detected stellar populations identified at a large galactocentric\nradius or extraplanar height, out to typically a few kpc. In the most massive\nof the studied galaxies there is evidence for a break in number density and\ncolor gradients of evolved stars, which plausibly correspond to the thick disk\nand halo components of the galaxies. The ratio of intermediate-age to old stars\nin the outermost fields correlate with the gas fraction, while relative sizes\nof the thick-to-thin disks anticorrelate with galactic circular velocity.\n","Comment: To appear in the proceedings for the IAUS 241 'Stellar Populations as\n  Building Blocks of Galaxies' held in La Palma, Spain, December 10-16 2006"]}]

The broadness and level of sophistication of this\ntechnique is documented in many monographs and reviews, see for example\n\\cite{Allan,Frenkel,mdhere}. Here we discuss the extension of MD to quantum\nsystems (QMD). There have been many attempts in this direction which differ\nfrom one another, depending on the type of system under consideration. One\ndirection of QMD has been developed for condensed matter systems and will not\ndiscussed here, e.g. \\cite{fermid}. In this chapter we are dealing with unbound\nelectrons as they occur in gases, fluids or plasmas. Here, one strategy is to\nreplace classical point particles by wave packets, e.g.\n\\cite{fermid,KTR94,zwicknagel06} which is quite successful. At the same time,\nthis method struggles with problems related to the dispersion of such a packet\nand difficulties to properly describe strong electron-ion interaction and bound\nstate formation. We, therefore, avoid such restrictions and consider a\ncompletely general alternative approach.
