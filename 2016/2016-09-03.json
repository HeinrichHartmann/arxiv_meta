For energetic\nreasons, macroscopic drops of liquid are nearly spherical away from interfaces\nwith solids, and any local deformations due to molecular-scale surface\ninteractions are negligible. Studies of wetting phenomena, therefore, typically\nassume that a liquid on a surface adopts the shape of a spherical cap. The\ndegree of wettability is then captured by the contact angle where the\nliquid-vapor interface meets the solid-liquid interface. As droplet volumes\nshrink to the scale of attoliters, however, surface interactions become\nsignificant, and droplets gradually assume distorted shapes that no longer\ncomply with our conventional, macroscopic conception of a drop. In this regime,\nthe contact angle becomes ambiguous, and it is unclear how to parametrize a\nliquid's affinity for a surface. A scalable metric for quantifying wettability\nis needed, especially given the emergence of technologies exploiting\nliquid-solid interactions at the nanoscale.

To translate\nback from this semi-group into rational numbers, we select a projection mapping\nsatisfying certain criteria to recover the numerator and denominator of the\ncontinued fractions in rational form. The central question of our research is\nto determine the multiplicity of a given denominator. To this end, we develop a\nheuristic method similar to the Hardy-Littlewood Circle Method. We compare this\ntheoretical model to the exact data, gleaned by simulation, and demonstrate\nthat our formula appears to be asymptotically valid. We then evaluate different\naspects of the accuracy of our formula.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

We consider social network games. In these games\nthe payoff of each player increases when other players choose the same\nstrategy. The definition of games on social networks was introduced by K. Apt\nand S. Simon. In an article written jointly with E. Markakis, they considered\nfour types of paradox of choice in such games and gave examples of three of\nthem. The existence of paradoxical networks of the fourth type was proven only\nin a weakened form. The existence of so-called vulnerable networks in the\nstrong sense remained an open question. In the present paper we solve this open\nquestion by introducing a construction, called a cascade, and use it to provide\nuniform examples for all four definitions of paradoxical networks.\n","Comment: As submitted to GAMES-2016 conference"]}]
