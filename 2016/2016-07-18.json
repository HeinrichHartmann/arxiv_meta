Following up on our recently\nproposed methods for encoding watermark numbers $w$ as reducible permutation\nflow-graphs $F[\\pi^*]$ through the use of self-inverting permutations $\\pi^*$,\nin this paper, we extend the types of flow-graphs available for software\nwatermarking by proposing two different reducible permutation flow-graphs\n$F_1[\\pi^*]$ and $F_2[\\pi^*]$ incorporating important properties which are\nderived from the bitonic subsequences composing the self-inverting permutation\n$\\pi^*$. We show that a self-inverting permutation $\\pi^*$ can be efficiently\nencoded into either $F_1[\\pi^*]$ or $F_2[\\pi^*]$ and also efficiently decoded\nfrom theses graph structures. The proposed flow-graphs $F_1[\\pi^*]$ and\n$F_2[\\pi^*]$ enrich the repository of graphs which can encode the same\nwatermark number $w$ and, thus, enable us to embed multiple copies of the same\nwatermark $w$ into an application program $P$. Moreover, the enrichment of that\nrepository with new flow-graphs increases our ability to select a graph\nstructure more similar to the structure of a given application program $P$\nthereby enhancing the resilience of our codec system to attacks.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures"]}]

Recent progress have\nextended SFM to the areas of {multi-body SFM} (where there are {multiple rigid}\nrelative motions in the scene), as well as {non-rigid SFM} (where there is a\nsingle non-rigid, deformable object or scene). Along this line of thinking,\nthere is apparently a missing gap of \"multi-body non-rigid SFM\", in which the\ntask would be to jointly reconstruct and segment multiple 3D structures of the\nmultiple, non-rigid objects or deformable scenes from images. Such a multi-body\nnon-rigid scenario is common in reality (e.g. two persons shaking hands,\nmulti-person social event), and how to solve it represents a natural\n{next-step} in SFM research. By leveraging recent results of subspace\nclustering, this paper proposes, for the first time, an effective framework for\nmulti-body NRSFM, which simultaneously reconstructs and segments each 3D\ntrajectory into their respective low-dimensional subspace. Under our\nformulation, 3D trajectories for each non-rigid structure can be well\napproximated with a sparse affine combination of other 3D trajectories from the\nsame structure (self-expressiveness). We solve the resultant optimization with\nthe alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). We demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed framework through extensive experiments on both\nsynthetic and real data sequences. Our method clearly outperforms other\nalternative methods, such as first clustering the 2D feature tracks to groups\nand then doing non-rigid reconstruction in each group or first conducting 3D\nreconstruction by using single subspace assumption and then clustering the 3D\ntrajectories into groups.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 16 figures"]}]

Results indicate that water transport increases\nwith an increasing fraction of connected percolated free volume, or\nwater-accessible open space, in the membrane polymer structure. This free\nvolume is enhanced by the dynamic structure of the membrane at the molecular\nlevel as it swells when hydrated and vibrates due to molecular collisions\nallowing a continuous path connecting the opposite membrane surfaces. The\ntortuous paths available for transport of solutes result in Brownian motion of\nsolute molecules and hopping from pore to pore as they pass through the polymer\nnetwork structure of the membrane. The transport of alcohol solutes decreases\nfor solutes with larger Van der Waals volume, which corresponds to less\navailable percolated free volume, or solute-accessible space, within the\nmembrane polymer structure. However, the Van der Waals size of the dehydrated\nsolutes is generally not a good measure to predict solute transport or\nrejection. Urea has reduced transport compared to ethanol, most likely due to\nmore complex chemistry, even though urea has a smaller Van der Waals volume\nthan ethanol. Na+ and Cl- experience the lowest transport, likely due to strong\nion-water and ion-ion electrostatic interactions.\n"]}]
