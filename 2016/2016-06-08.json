In the second part, we\ngive a direct construction of the Connes-Chern character of a twisted spectral,\nboth in the invertible and non-invertible cases. Combining these two parts we\nobtain an analogue the Atiyah-Singer index formula for twisted spectral\ntriples.\n","Comment: 35 pages; v3: minor changes to the exposition on $\\sigma$-connections"]}]

Current solar energetic particle (SEP) propagation models describe\nthe effects of interplanetary plasma turbulence on SEPs as diffusion, using a\nFokker-Planck (FP) equation. However, FP models cannot explain the observed\nfast access of SEPs across the average magnetic field to regions that are\nwidely separated in longitude within the heliosphere without using\nunrealistically strong cross-field diffusion.\n  Aims. We study whether the recently suggested early non-diffusive phase of\nSEP propagation can explain the wide SEP events with realistic particle\ntransport parameters.\n  Methods. We used a novel model that accounts for the SEP propagation along\nfield lines that meander as a result of plasma turbulence. Such a non-diffusive\npropagation mode has been shown to dominate the SEP cross-field propagation\nearly in the SEP event history. We compare the new model to the traditional\napproach, and to SEP observations.\n  Results. Using the new model, we reproduce the observed longitudinal extent\nof SEP peak fluxes that are characterised by a Gaussian profile with\n$\\sigma=30-50^\\circ$, while current diffusion theory can only explain extents\nof 11$^\\circ$ with realistic diffusion coefficients. Our model also reproduces\nthe timing of SEP arrival at distant longitudes, which cannot be explained\nusing the diffusion model.\n  Conclusions. The early onset of SEPs over a wide range of longitudes can be\nunderstood as a result of the effects of magnetic field-line random walk in the\ninterplanetary medium and requires an SEP transport model that properly\ndescribes the non-diffusive early phase of SEP cross-field propagation.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures.

Past surveys\nhave achieved photometric precision of 1-2% by calibrating the survey's stellar\nphotometry with repeated measurements of a large number of stars observed in\nmultiple epochs. The calibration techniques employed by these surveys only\nconsider the relative frame-by-frame photometric zeropoint offset and the focal\nplane position-dependent illumination corrections, which are independent of the\nsource color. However, variations in the wavelength dependence of the\natmospheric transmission and the instrumental throughput induce source\ncolor-dependent systematic errors. These systematic errors must also be\nconsidered to achieve the most precise photometric measurements. In this paper,\nwe examine such systematic chromatic errors using photometry from the Dark\nEnergy Survey (DES) as an example. We define a natural magnitude system for DES\nand calculate the systematic errors on stellar magnitudes, when the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput deviate from the natural system. We\nconclude that the systematic chromatic errors caused by the change of airmass\nin each exposure, the change of the precipitable water vapor and aerosol in the\natmosphere over time, and the non-uniformity of instrumental throughput over\nthe focal plane, can be up to 2% in some bandpasses. We compare the calculated\nsystematic chromatic errors with the observed DES data. For the test sample\ndata, we correct these errors using measurements of the atmospheric\ntransmission and instrumental throughput. The residual after correction is less\nthan 0.3%. We also find that the errors for non-stellar objects are\nredshift-dependent and can be larger than those for stars at certain redshifts.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures, AJ accepted"]}]

Although a number of high statistical quality\nbroad-band (0.1-100 keV) X-ray observations are available, the spectral energy\ndistribution of these sources is usually investigated by adopting pure\nphenomenological models, rather than models linked to the physics of accretion.\nIn this paper, a detailed spectral study of the X-ray emission recorded from\nthe high-mass X-ray binary pulsars Cen X-3, 4U 0115+63, and Her X-1 is carried\nout by using BeppoSAX and joined Suzaku+NuStar data, together with an advanced\nversion of the compmag model. The latter provides a physical description of the\nhigh energy emission from accreting pulsars, including the thermal and bulk\nComptonization of cyclotron and bremsstrahlung seed photons along the neutron\nstar accretion column. The compmag model is based on an iterative method for\nsolving second-order partial differential equations, whose convergence\nalgorithm has been improved and consolidated during the preparation of this\npaper. Our analysis shows that the broad-band X-ray continuum of all considered\nsources can be self-consistently described by the compmag model. The cyclotron\nabsorption features, not included in the model, can be accounted for by using\nGaussian components. From the fits of the compmag model to the data we inferred\nthe physical properties of the accretion columns in all sources, finding values\nreasonably close to those theoretically expected according to our current\nunderstanding of accretion in highly magnetized neutron stars.

Stochastic optimisation\napproaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be effective,\nbut often the setting up of such optimisations and the choice of a specific\nsearch algorithm and its parameters is non-trivial, requiring domain-specific\nexpertise. Here we describe BluePyOpt, a Python package targeted at the broad\nneuroscience community to simplify this task. BluePyOpt is an extensible\nframework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and\nstandardises several existing open-source tools. It simplifies the task of\ncreating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and\nknowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation\ntasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to\nestablished best-practices. Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up\nboth small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging\nfrom laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures. The\nversatility of the BluePyOpt framework is demonstrated by working through three\nrepresentative neuroscience specific use cases.\n"]}]

The reason for this dichotomy of wind-fed HMXBs is still a matter\nof debate.

Only dedicated\nempiric analysis of the donors' stellar wind can provide the required\ninformation to accomplish an adequate test of these theories. However, such\nanalyses are scarce. To close this gap, we perform a comparative analysis of\nthe optical companion in two important systems: IGR J17544-2619 (SFXT) and Vela\nX-1 (SGXB).

We use the DisPerSE algorithm to identify spatially coherent\nstructures located across the inner-Galaxy (300 < l < 60 and |b| < 1.5).\n  Results. We have determined distances, masses and physical sizes for 241 of\nthe filamentary structures. We find a median distance of 3.8 kpc, a mean mass\nof a few 10^3 m_sun, a mean length of ~6pc and a mass-to-length ratio of (M/L)\n~200-2000M_sun/ pc. We also find that these filamentary structures are tightly\ncorrelated with the spiral arms in longitude and velocity, and that their\nsemi-major axis is preferentially aligned parallel to the Galactic mid-plane\nand therefore with the direction of large-scale Galactic magnetic field. We\nfind many examples where the dense filaments identified in ATLASGAL are\nassociated with larger scale filamentary structures (~100 pc), and argue that\nthis is likely to be common, and as such these may indicate a connection\nbetween large-scale Galactic dynamics and star formation.\n  Conclusions. We have produced a large and Galaxy-wide catalogue of dense\nfilamentary structures that are representative of a particular size and mass\nrange not previously well studied in the literature. Analyses of the properties\nand distribution of these filaments reveals that they are correlated with the\nspiral arms and make a significant contribution to star formation in the\nGalaxy.

Below the breaking energy, the Band function\nreduces to a cut-off power law, while above the breaking energy it is a simple\npower law. However, for some detectors (such as the Swift-BAT) whose working\nenergy is well below or just near the breaking energy, the observed spectra can\nbe fitted to cut-off power law with enough precision. Besides, since the energy\nband of Swift-BAT is very narrow, the spectra of most GRBs can be fitted well\neven using a simple power law. In this paper, with the most up-to-date sample\nof Swift-BAT GRBs, we study the effect of different spectral models on the\nempirical luminosity correlations, and further investigate the effect on the\nreconstruction of GRB Hubble diagram. We mainly focus on two luminosity\ncorrelations, i.e., the Amati relation and Yonetoku relation. We calculate\nthese two luminosity correlations on both the case that the GRB spectra are\nmodeled by Band function and cut-off power law. It is found that both\nluminosity correlations only moderately depend on the choice of GRB spectra.\nMonte Carlo simulations show that Amati relation is insensitive to the\nhigh-energy power-law index of the Band function. As a result, the GRB Hubble\ndiagram calibrated using luminosity correlations is almost independent on the\nGRB spectra.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

Detailed studies of stellar populations in the galaxies should\nconstrain the proposed scenarios.

From a SED fit to\nthe four longest Herschel wavelengths, we determine column density and\ntemperature maps and derive masses, volume densities and surface densities for\nthese structures. We find that the morphological classification corresponds to\ndistinct physical properties. Pillars and globules have the longest estimated\nphotoevaporation lifetimes, a few 10^6 yr, while all other features should\nsurvive less than that. These lifetimes are consistent with that found in\nsimulations of turbulent, UV-illuminated clouds. We propose a tentative\nevolutionary scheme in which pillars can evolve into globules, which in turn\nthen evolve into EGGs, condensations and proplyd-like objects.\n","Comment: Received February 18, 2016; accepted April 5, 2016, by A&A"]}]

We combine simultaneous fitting of all CN\nhyperfines with Monte Carlo simulations for a large range in realization of the\nmagnetic field to obtain a constraint on the line-of-sight field strength of\n-687 +/- 420 microG. We also analyze archival dust polarization observations\ntowards G35.20w. A strong magnetic field is implied by the remarkably ordered\nfield orientation that is perpendicular to the longest axis of the clump. Based\non this, we also estimate the plane-of-sky component of the magnetic field to\nbe ~740 microG. This allows for a unique comparison of the two orthogonal\nmeasurements of magnetic field strength of the same region and at similar\nspatial scales. The expected total field strength shows no significant conflict\nbetween the observed field and that required for pressure equilibrium. By\nproducing a probability distribution for a large range in field geometries, we\nshow that plane-of-sky projections are much closer to the true field strengths\nthan line-of-sight projections. This can present a significant challenge for\nZeeman measurements of magnetized structures, even with ALMA. We also show that\nCN molecule does not suffer from depletion on the observed scales in the\npredominantly cold and highly deuterated core in an early stage of high-mass\nstar formation and is thus a good tracer of the dense gas.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, A&A in press"]}]

Based on observations of the $^{13}$C isotopologues of formamide and a\nstandard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio, the deuterium fractionation is found to be\nsimilar for the three different forms with a value of about 2%.

Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the\nresolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional\nNeural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of\nfilters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of\nparameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial\npyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales.

In this paper, we extend the operation of IRSA with i) an\niterative physical layer decoding processing that exploits the capture effect\nand ii) a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) processing at the\nslot-level, named intra-slot SIC, to decode more than one colliding packet per\nslot. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, referred to as\nExtended IRSA (E-IRSA), in terms of throughput and channel capacity.\nComputer-based simulation results show that E-IRSA protocol allows to reach the\nmaximum theoretical achievable throughput even in scenarios where the number of\nactive users is higher than the number of slots per frame. Results also show\nthat E-IRSA protocol significantly improves the performance even for small MAC\nframe lengths used in practical scenarios.\n","Comment: 2015 IEEE International Conference on Communication Workshop (ICCW)"]}]

However,\nin LSM-tree, random key-value queries can experience long latency and low\nthroughput due to the interference from the compaction, a basic operation in\nthe algorithm, to caching. LSM-tree relies on frequent compaction operations to\nmerge data into a sorted structure. After a compaction, the original data are\nreorganized and written to other locations on the disk. As a result, the cached\ndata are invalidated since their referencing addresses are changed, causing\nserious performance degradations.\n  We propose dLSM in order to re-enable high-speed caching during intensive\nwrites. dLSM is an LSM-tree with a compaction buffer on the disk, working as a\ncushion to minimize the cache invalidation caused by compactions. The\ncompaction buffer maintains a series of snapshots of the frequently compacted\ndata, which represent a consistent view of the corresponding data in the\nunderlying LSM-tree. Being updated in a much lower rate than that of\ncompactions, data in the compaction buffer are almost stationary. In dLSM, an\nobject is referenced by the disk address of the corresponding block either in\nthe compaction buffer for frequently compacted data, or in the underlying\nLSM-tree for infrequently compacted data. Thus, hot objects can be effectively\nkept in the cache without harmful invalidations. With the help of a small\non-disk compaction buffer, dLSM achieves a high query performance by enabling\neffective caching, while retaining all merits of LSM-tree for write-intensive\ndata processing.

Here, we\ninvestigate the astrometric signatures of binary sources taking into account\ntheir orbital motion and the parallax effect due to the Earth motion, which\nturn out not to be negligible in most cases. We also show that considering the\nabove-mentioned effects is important in the analysis of astrometric data in\norder to correctly estimate the lens-event parameters.\n","Comment: Published on ApJ, 2016, 823, 120"]}]

Good finite data\nperformance is achieved by limiting the sharing of private information by\ndecreasing the dimensionality and by projecting outliers to fit tighter bounds,\ntherefore needing to add less noise for equal privacy. As already the\nsimple-to-implement method shows promise on the challenging genomic data, we\nanticipate rapid progress towards practical applications in many fields, such\nas mobile sensing and social media, in addition to the badly needed precision\nmedicine solutions.\n","Comment: 13 pages + 12 pages supplementary information, 3 + 2 figures"]}]

While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very\nchallenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in\ncollaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are\nindeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such\nmotions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect\nto an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their\npartner's motion can be captured well through iterative re-planning with the\nabove cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function\nwhich \"explains\" the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example\ntrajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative assembly\ntask using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost\nfunction from these trajectories. Finally, we predict reaching motions from the\nhuman's current configuration to a task-space goal region by iteratively\nre-planning a trajectory using the learned cost function. Our planning\nalgorithm is based on the trajectory optimizer STOMP, it plans for a 23 DoF\nhuman kinematic model and accounts for the presence of a moving collaborator\nand obstacles in the environment. Our results suggest that in most cases, our\nmethod outperforms baseline methods when predicting motions.

We quantify these\nanisotropies by the ratio, $R$, of the quadrupole to monopole angular moments\nof the power spectrum. In contrast to linear theory, the Zel'dovich\napproximation predicts a decline in $R$ with decreasing scale. This departure\nfrom linear theory is due to nonlinear dynamics and not a result of incoherent\nrandom velocities. The rate of decline depends strongly on $\\Omega$ and the\ninitial power spectrum. However, we find a {\\it universal} relation between the\nquantity $R/R_{lin}$ (where $R_{lin}$ the linear theory value of $R$) and the\ndimensionless variable $k/k_{nl}$, where $k_{nl}$ is a wavenumber determined by\nthe scale of nonlinear structures. The universal relation is in good agreement\nwith a large N-body simulation. This universal relation greatly extends the\nscales over which redshift distortions can be used as a probe of $\\Omega$. A\npreliminary application to the 1.2 Jy IRAS yields $\\Omega\\sim 0.4$ if IRAS\ngalaxies are unbiased.\n","Comment: uuencoded compressed postscript.

Its total X-ray luminosity is probably larger than 1.2E39 erg/s.\nThe observed variability argues against a superbubble interpretation, and the\noff-nuclear position argues against a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.\nThe source is therefore probably either an ultra-powerful X-ray binary or an\nultra-powerful supernova remnant.

Eleven high redshift damped Lya systems\ncovering 2.8<z<4.4 were discovered in 26 QSOs from the APM z>4 QSO Survey,\nextending these absorption system surveys to the highest redshifts currently\npossible. Combining our new data set with previous surveys we find that the\ncosmological mass density in neutral gas, omega_g, does not rise as steeply\nprior to z~2 as indicated by previous studies. There is evidence in the\nobserved omega_g for a flattening at z~2 and a possible turnover at z~3. When\ncombined with the decline at z>3.5 in number density per unit redshift of\ndamped systems with column densities log N(HI)>21 atoms cm^-2, these results\npoint to an epoch at z>3 prior to which the highest column density damped\nsystems are still forming. We find that over the redshift range 2<z<4 the total\nmass in neutral gas is marginally comparable with the total visible mass in\nstars in present day galaxies. However, if one considers the total mass visible\nin stellar disks alone, ie excluding galactic bulges, the two values are\ncomparable. We are observing a mass of neutral gas comparable to the mass of\nvisible disk stars. Lanzetta, Wolfe & Turnshek (1995) found that omega_g(z~3.5)\nwas twice omega_g(z~2), implying a much larger amount of star formation must\nhave taken place between z=3.5 and z=2 than is indicated by metallicity\nstudies.

It is a puzzle that such\nluminosities are not observed.
