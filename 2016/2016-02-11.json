For this, it is first necessary to review previous methods to\napply QCD perturbation theory at low spacelike momentum scales, where the\ninfluence of the Landau singularities becomes inevitable. Several concepts are\nconsidered and their limitations are pointed out. The usefulness of FAPT is\ndiscussed in terms of two characteristic hadronic quantities: the\nperturbatively calculable part of the pion's electromagnetic form factor in the\nspacelike region and the Higgs-boson decay into a $b\\bar b$ pair in the\ntimelike region. In the first case, the focus is on the optimization of the\nprediction with respect to the choice of the renormalization scheme and the\ndependence on the renormalization and the factorization scales. The second case\nserves to show that the application of FAPT to this reaction reaches already at\nthe four-loop level an accuracy of the order of 1%, avoiding difficulties\ninherent in the standard perturbative expansion.

The results suggest that a\nfraction of the observed satellites could plausibly be galaxies without dark\nmatter that have true M/L ratios much lower than those measured. The inflated\nM/L ratios arise because they are observed at the right time, along the right\norbit and during the quasi-equilibrium phase of their evolution. This is a\nviable explanation for the high M/L ratios observed in all satellites as long\nas the satellites are preferentially on certain orbits and are observed at\ncertain times.

For manifold-valued data, the problem becomes even more involved since\ntypical features of vector spaces are not available. In this paper, we propose\nalgorithms for Mumford-Shah and for Potts regularization of manifold-valued\nsignals and images. For the univariate problems, we derive solvers based on\ndynamic programming combined with (convex) optimization techniques for\nmanifold-valued data. For the class of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds (which\nincludes the data space in diffusion tensor imaging), we show that our\nalgorithms compute global minimizers for any starting point. For the\nmultivariate Mumford-Shah and Potts problems (for image regularization) we\npropose a splitting into suitable subproblems which we can solve exactly using\nthe techniques developed for the corresponding univariate problems. Our method\ndoes not require any a priori restrictions on the edge set and we do not have\nto discretize the data space. We apply our method to diffusion tensor imaging\n(DTI) as well as Q-ball imaging. Using the DTI model, we obtain a segmentation\nof the corpus callosum.\n"]}]

It was commonly believed that the relative phase deviations would\nprevent the relative phase Toffolis from being very helpful in practical\nlarge-scale designs.\n  In this paper, we report three circuit identities that provide the means for\nreplacing certain configurations of the multiple control Toffoli gates with\ntheir simpler relative phase implementations, up to a selectable unitary on\ncertain qubits, and without changing the overall functionality.

Here, previous methods are extended so that (i) 2nd-order\nsensitivity is formulated for base flow changes satisfying linearised\nNavier-Stokes, and (ii) the resulting method is applicable to a 2D global\ninstability problem. This makes it possible to formulate 2nd-order sensitivity\nto shape modifications. Using this formulation, we find the optimal shape to\nsuppress the a cylinder wake instability.

The novelty of this\ninvestigation lies in the application of such a method, previously applied\n(Milton 1980; Bergman 1980) to problems involving cyclic loadings in the\nfrequency domain, to derive bounds in the time domain for the antiplane\nviscoelasticity case. The position of the poles and the residues matrices are\nthe variational parameters of the problem: the aim is to determine such\nparameters in order to have the minimum (or maximum) response at any given\nmoment in time. All the information about the composite is translated for each\nfixed pole configuration into constraints on the residues, the so-called sum\nrules. The linearity of the constraints, along with the observation that the\nresponse at a fixed time is linear in the residues, enables one to use the\ntheory of linear programming to reduce the problem to one involving relatively\nfew non-zero residues. Finally, bounds on the response are obtained by\nnumerically optimizing over the pole positions. In the examples studied, the\nresults turn out to be very accurate estimates: if sufficient information about\nthe composite is available, the bounds can be quite tight over the entire range\nof time, allowing one to predict the transient behavior of the composite.\nFurthermore, the bounds incorporating the volume fractions (and possibly\ntransverse isotropy) can be extremely tight at certain specific times.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 9 figures, to be published as a chapter of the book\n  \"Extending the Theory of Composites to Other Areas of Science\", edited by\n  G.W.

The chemistry of the diffuse interstellar medium rests upon three\npillars: exothermic ion-neutral reactions (\" cold chemistry \"), endothermic\nneutral-neutral reactions with significant activation barriers (\" warm\nchemistry \"), and reactions on the surfaces of dust grains. While warm\nchemistry becomes important in the shocks associated with turbulent dissipation\nregions, the main path for the formation of interstellar OH and H2O is that of\ncold chemistry. Aims. The aim of this study is to observationally confirm the\nassociation of atomic oxygen with both atomic and molecular gas phases, and to\nunderstand the measured abundances of OH and OH + as a function of the\navailable reservoir of H2. Methods. We obtained absorption spectra of the\nground states of OH, OH+ and OI with high-velocity resolution, with GREAT\non-board SOFIA, and with the THz receiver at the APEX. We analyzed them along\nwith ancillary spectra of HF and CH from HIFI. To deconvolve them from the\nhyperfine structure and to separate the blend that is due to various velocity\ncomponents on the sightline, we fit model spectra consisting of an appropriate\nnumber of Gaussian profiles using a method combining simulated annealing with\ndownhill simplex minimization. Together with HF and/or CH as a surrogate for\nH2, and HI $\\lambda$21 cm data, the molecular hydrogen fraction f^N\\_H2 = N(H\n2)/(N(H) + 2N(H 2)) can be determined. We then investigated abundance ratios as\na function of f^N\\_H2. Results. The column density of OI is correlated at a\nhigh significance with the amount of available molecular and atomic hydrogen,\nwith an atomic oxygen abundance of $3 \\times 10 ^{-4}$ relative to H nuclei.\nWhile the velocities of the absorption features of OH and OH+ are loosely\ncorrelated and reflect the spiral arm crossings on the sightline, upon closer\ninspection they display an anticorrespondence. The arm-to-interarm density\ncontrast is found to be higher in OH than in OH+. While both species can\ncoexist, with a higher abundance in OH than in OH+, the latter is found less\nfrequently in absence of OH than the other way around, which is a direct\nconsequence of the rapid destruction of OH+ by dissociative recombination when\nnot enough H2 is available. This conjecture has been substantiated by a\ncomparison between the OH/OH+ ratio with f^N\\_H2, showing a clear correlation.\nThe hydrogen abstraction reaction chain OH+ (H2,H) H2O+ (H2,H)H3O+ is confirmed\nas the pathway for the production of OH and H 2 O. Our estimate of the\nbranching ratio of the dissociative recombination of H3O+ to OH and H2O is\nconfined within the interval of 84 to 91%, which matches laboratory\nmeasurements (74 to 83%). -- A correlation between the linewidths and column\ndensities of OH+ features is found to be significant with a false-alarm\nprobability below 5%. Such a correlation is predicted by models of interstellar\nMHD turbulence. For OH the same correlation is found to be insignificant\nbecause there are more narrow absorption features. Conclusions. While it is\ndifficult to assess the contributions of warm neutral-neutral chemistry to the\nobserved abundances, it seems fair to conclude that the predictions of cold\nion-neutral chemistry match the abundance patterns we observed.\n"]}]
