In statistics, submodularity isolates cases in\nwhich collinearity makes the choice of model features difficult from those in\nwhich this task is routine. Researchers often report the signal-to-noise ratio\nto measure the difficulty of simulated data examples. A measure of\nsubmodularity should also be provided as it characterizes an independent\ncomponent difficulty.

Within an optical system, it is common that\nthis Gaussian TEM00 beam passes through a circular aperture of a finite\ndiameter. Such circular apertures include irises, spatial filters, circular\nPhoto-Detectors (PDs) and optical mounts with circular rims. The magnitude of\noptical power passing through a finite-sized circular aperture is\nwell-documented for cases where the Gaussian beam passes through the center of\nthe clear circular aperture, and is chopped off symmetrically in all radial\ndirections on a given plane. More often than not, a non-axial incident Gaussian\nBeam is not blocked in a radially uniform manner by a circular aperture. Such\nsituations arise due to a lateral displacement of the beam from tilted glass\nblocks, manufacturing errors and imperfect surface flatness or parallelness of\nsurfaces.

We also describe many $(\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2)$-avoiding\ngraphs, including a complete characterisation of most\n$(\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2)$-critical graphs, i.e., $(\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2)$-avoiding\ngraphs on $R(\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2)-1$ vertices, such that $\\Gamma_1$ or $\\Gamma_2$\ncontains a cycle of length at most $5$. For length $4$, this is an easy\nextension of a recent result of Wu, Sun, and Radziszowski, in which\n$|\\Gamma_1|=|\\Gamma_2|=1$. For lengths $3$ and $5$, our results are new even in\nthis special case.\n  Keywords: generalised Ramsey number, critical graph, cycle, set of cycles\n","Comment: 18 pages, 1 figure"]}]
