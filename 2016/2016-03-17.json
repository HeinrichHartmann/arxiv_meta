This is in contrast with the common belief that Mott physics and\nphonon-driven s-wave superconductivity are incompatible, raising a fundamental\nquestion on the mechanism of the high-Tc superconductivity. This article\nreviews recent ab initio calculations, which have succeeded in reproducing\ncomprehensively the experimental phase diagram with high accuracy and\nelucidated an unusual cooperation between the electron-phonon coupling and the\nelectron-electron interactions leading to Mott localization to realize an\nunconventional s-wave superconductivity in the alkali-doped fullerides. A\ndriving force behind the exotic physics is unusual intramolecular interactions,\ncharacterized by the coexistence of a strongly repulsive Coulomb interaction\nand a small effectively negative exchange interaction. This is realized by a\nsubtle energy balance between the coupling with the Jahn-Teller phonons and\nHund's coupling within the C60 molecule. The unusual form of the interaction\nleads to a formation of pairs of up- and down-spin electrons on the molecules,\nwhich enables the s-wave pairing. The emergent superconductivity crucially\nrelies on the presence of the Jahn-Teller phonons, but surprisingly benefits\nfrom the strong correlations because the correlations suppress the kinetic\nenergy of the electrons and help the formation of the electron pairs, in\nagreement with previous model calculations. This confirms that the alkali-doped\nfullerides are a new type of unconventional superconductors, where the unusual\nsynergy between the phonons and Coulomb interactions drives the high-Tc\nsuperconductivity.\n","Comment: Review article on the superconductivity in alkali-doped fullerides.\n  19 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables"]}]

Using online gradient descent, we propose a method that\nsequentially predicts the value of the parameter and in turn suffers a loss.\nThe objective is to minimize the accumulation of losses over the time horizon,\na notion that is termed dynamic regret. While existing methods focus on convex\nloss functions, we consider strongly convex functions so as to provide better\nguarantees of performance. We derive a regret bound that captures the\npath-length of the time-varying parameter, defined in terms of the distance\nbetween its consecutive values. In other words, the bound represents the\nnatural connection of tracking quality to the rate of change of the parameter.\nWe provide numerical experiments to complement our theoretical findings.\n"]}]

We provide\nspectral types of 90% of the 57 sources brighter than m_F555W = 16.0 mag within\na radius of 0.5 parsec of R136a1, plus 8 additional nearby sources including\nR136b (O4\\,If/WN8). We measure wind velocities for 52 early-type stars from CIV\n1548-51, including 16 O2-3 stars. For the first time we spectroscopically\nclassify all Weigelt & Baier members of R136a, which comprise three WN5 stars\n(a1-a3), two O supergiants (a5-a6) and three early O dwarfs (a4, a7, a8). A\ncomplete Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the most massive O stars in R136 is\nprovided, from which we obtain a cluster age of 1.5+0.3_-0.7 Myr. In addition,\nwe discuss the integrated ultraviolet spectrum of R136, and highlight the\ncentral role played by the most luminous stars in producing the prominent HeII\n1640 emission line. This emission is totally dominated by very massive stars\nwith initial masses above ~100 Msun. The presence of strong HeII 1640 emission\nin the integrated light of very young star clusters (e.g A1 in NGC 3125)\nfavours an initial mass function extending well beyond a conventional upper\nlimit of 100 Msun.

Remarkably, this\ntask can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians.\nThese two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum\ngates.

While HJ\nreachability in theory is applicable to many small practical systems, the curse\nof dimensionality prevents the direct application of HJ reachability to many\nlarger systems. To address computation complexity issues, various efficient\ncomputation methods in the literature have been developed for approximating or\nexactly computing the solution to HJ partial differential equations, but only\nwhen the system dynamics are of specific forms. In this paper, we propose a\nflexible method to trade off optimality with computation complexity in HJ\nreachability analysis.

The\ntime evolution of statistical moments is generally not closed for SHS, in the\nsense that the time derivative of the lower-order moments depends on\nhigher-order moments. Here, we identify an important class of SHS where moment\ndynamics is automatically closed, and hence moments can be computed exactly by\nsolving a system of coupled differential equations. This class is referred to\nas linear time-triggered SHS (TTSHS), where the state evolves according to a\nlinear dynamical system. Stochastic events occur at discrete times and the\nintervals between them are independent random variables that follow a general\nclass of probability distributions. Moreover, whenever the event occurs, the\nstate of the SHS changes randomly based on a probability distribution. Our\napproach relies on embedding a Markov chain based on phase-type processes to\nmodel timing of events, and showing that the resulting system has closed moment\ndynamics. Interestingly, we identify a subclass of linear TTSHS, where the\nfirst and second-order moments depend only on the mean time interval between\nevents and invariant of their higher-order statistics.
