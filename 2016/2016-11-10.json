In order to study the\nrobustness of the previous results, the present research examines the effects\nof modifying some of the components of the original model. For improved\nbiological realism, we replace the original non-leaky integrate-and-fire\nneurons with Izhikevich-like neurons.

The probabilistic\nSTDP slightly but significantly improves the performance for both types of\nmodel neurons. Use of the Izhikevich-like neuron was not found to improve\nperformance although performance was still comparable to the IF neuron.

The case of a\nfinite number of wires arranged in a ring (not treated by Feynman), as a model\nof Faraday cage, is different.

Higher photospheric temperature of Gaia16apd than that of normal\nSNe may also contribute to the observed far-UV excess.

Since then, PNC has attracted a wide\nfollowing within the research community. A high point of PNC research was a\ntheoretical proof that the use of nested lattice codes in PNC could achieve the\ncapacity of a two-way relay network to within half bit. Many practical\nchallenges, however, remain to be addressed before the full potential of\nlattice-coded PNC can be realized. Two major challenges are channel alignment\nof distributed nodes and complexity reduction of lattice encoding-decoding.\nThis paper reports a first comprehensive implementation of a lattice-coded PNC\nsystem. Our contributions are twofold: 1) we design and demonstrate a\nlow-overhead channel precoding scheme that can accurately align the channels of\ndistributed nodes driven by independent low-cost temperature-compensated\noscillators (TCXO); 2) we adapt the low-density lattice code (LDLC) for use in\npractical PNC systems.

Recent work\nhas answered this question positively, in the form of the Plug-and-Play Prior\n($P^3$) method, showing that any inverse problem can be handled by sequentially\napplying image denoising steps. This relies heavily on the ADMM optimization\ntechnique in order to obtain this chained denoising interpretation.\n  Is this the only way in which tasks in image processing can exploit the image\ndenoising engine? In this paper we provide an alternative, more powerful and\nmore flexible framework for achieving the same goal. As opposed to the $P^3$\nmethod, we offer Regularization by Denoising (RED): using the denoising engine\nin defining the regularization of the inverse problem. We propose an explicit\nimage-adaptive Laplacian-based regularization functional, making the overall\nobjective functional clearer and better defined. With a complete flexibility to\nchoose the iterative optimization procedure for minimizing the above\nfunctional, RED is capable of incorporating any image denoising algorithm,\ntreat general inverse problems very effectively, and is guaranteed to converge\nto the globally optimal result. We test this approach and demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art results in the image deblurring and super-resolution problems.\n"]}]
