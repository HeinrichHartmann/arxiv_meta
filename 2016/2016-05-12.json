Earlier research in this\nfield emphasizes that herding behavior occurs with a positive probability in\ncertain special cases; recent studies show that asymptotic learning is\nachievable under a more general observation structure. In particular, with\nunbounded private beliefs, asymptotic learning occurs if and only if agents\nobserve a close predecessor, i.e., the action of a close predecessor reveals\nthe true state in the limit. However, a prevailing assumption in these studies\nis that the observation structure in the society is exogenous. In contrast to\nmost of the previous literature, I assume in this paper that observation is\nendogenous and costly. More specifically, each agent must pay a specific cost\nto make any observation and can strategically choose the set of actions to\nobserve privately. I introduce the notion of maximal learning (relative to\ncost) as a natural extension of asymptotic learning: society achieves maximal\nlearning when agents can learn the true state with probability 1 in the limit\nafter paying the cost of observation. I show that observing only a close\npredecessor is no longer sufficient for learning the true state with unbounded\nprivate beliefs and positive costs. Instead, maximal learning occurs if and\nonly if the size of the observations extends to infinity. I provide interesting\ncomparative statics as to how various settings in the model affect the learning\nprobability.

Later, parameters affecting energy in\nWSNs are extracted. The dependency between these parameters and the average\nenergy consumption of an application is then investigated.

Our findings thus validate\nthe concept of demography being represented in OSN language use and show that\nthe traits observed are inherently present in the word frequencies without any\nprevious assumptions about the dataset.

In the last twenty years, multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) antenna techniques have been considered as the key techniques to\nincrease the capacity of wireless communication systems. When a large-scale\nantenna array (which is also called massive MIMO) is equipped in a\nbase-station, or a large number of distributed antennas (which is also called\nlarge-scale distributed MIMO) are deployed, the spectral and energy\nefficiencies can be further improved by using spatial domain multiple access.\nThis paper provides an overview of massive MIMO and large-scale distributed\nMIMO systems, including spectral efficiency analysis, channel state information\n(CSI) acquisition, wireless transmission technology, and resource allocation.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures"]}]
