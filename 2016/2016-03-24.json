This online problem arises, e.g.,\nin the context of sensor networks. We focus on two main variants of MBP.\n  The discrete MBP is a 2-person game played on a graph $G=(V,E)$. The player\nis initially located at a vertex of the graph. In each time step, the adversary\npours a total of one unit of water into cups that are located on the vertices\nof the graph, arbitrarily distributing the water among the cups. The player\nthen moves from her current vertex to an adjacent vertex and empties the cup at\nthat vertex. The player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the\nmaximum amount of water in any cup at any time.\n  The geometric MBP is a continuous-time version of the MBP: the cups are\npoints in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at\na constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. Again, the\nplayer's objective is to minimize the backlog.\n  We show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the MBP has a lower\nbound of $\\Omega(D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete\nMBP) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric MBP). Therefore we\nfocus on determining a strategy for the player that guarantees a uniform upper\nbound on the absolute value of the backlog.\n  For the absolute value of the backlog there is a trivial lower bound of\n$\\Omega(D)$, and the deamortization analysis of Dietz and Sleator gives an\nupper bound of $O(D\\log N)$ for $N$ cups. Our main result is a tight upper\nbound for the geometric MBP: we show that there is a strategy for the player\nthat guarantees a backlog of $O(D)$, independently of the number of cups.\n","Comment: 1+16 pages, 3 figures"]}]

However, service systems are generally staffed by\npeople. Furthermore, people respond to workload incentives; that is, how hard a\nperson works can depend both on how much work there is, and how the work is\ndivided between the people responsible for it. In a service system, the routing\nand staffing policies control such workload incentives; and so the rate servers\nwork will be impacted by the system's routing and staffing policies. This\nobservation has consequences when modeling service system performance, and our\nobjective is to investigate those consequences.\n  We do this in the context of the M/M/N queue, which is the canonical model\nfor large service systems. First, we present a model for \"strategic\" servers\nthat choose their service rate in order to maximize a trade-off between an\n\"effort cost\", which captures the idea that servers exert more effort when\nworking at a faster rate, and a \"value of idleness\", which assumes that servers\nvalue having idle time. Next, we characterize the symmetric Nash equilibrium\nservice rate under any routing policy that routes based on the server idle\ntime. We find that the system must operate in a quality-driven regime, in which\nservers have idle time, in order for an equilibrium to exist, which implies\nthat the staffing must have a first-order term that strictly exceeds that of\nthe common square-root staffing policy. Then, within the class of policies that\nadmit an equilibrium, we (asymptotically) solve the problem of minimizing the\ntotal cost, when there are linear staffing costs and linear waiting costs.\nFinally, we end by exploring the question of whether routing policies that are\nbased on the service rate, instead of the server idle time, can improve system\nperformance.\n","Comment: First submitted for journal publication in 2014; accepted for\n  publication in Operations Research in 2016.

Using a recently developed, realistic\nmodel of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a\nmyocyte coupled to passive cells.

We observe that\ndifferent dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction\nconductances: at low coupling strength, the activity is confined to cell\nclusters, while the activity for high coupling may spread across the entire\ntissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous\ngeneration of spiral wave activity.

This is necessary to avoid loops, inhibiting opportunities to\nimplement an adaptive and intelligent forwarding plane. Consequently, content\ndistribution efficiency is reduced due to a lack of inherent multi-path\ntransmission. In Named Data Networking (NDN) instead, routing shall hold a\nsupporting role to forwarding, providing sufficient potential to enhance\ncontent dissemination at the forwarding plane. In this paper we design,\nimplement, and evaluate a novel probability-based forwarding strategy, called\nStochastic Adaptive Forwarding (SAF) for NDN. SAF imitates a self-adjusting\nwater pipe system, intelligently guiding and distributing Interests through\nnetwork crossings circumventing link failures and bottlenecks. Just as real\npipe systems, SAF employs overpressure valves enabling congested nodes to lower\npressure autonomously. Through an implicit feedback mechanism it is ensured\nthat the fraction of the traffic forwarded via congested nodes decreases. By\nconducting simulations we show that our approach outperforms existing\nforwarding strategies in terms of the Interest satisfaction ratio in the\nmajority of the evaluated scenarios. This is achieved by extensive utilization\nof NDN's multipath and content-lookup capabilities without relying on the\nrouting plane. SAF explores the local environment by redirecting requests that\nare likely to be dropped anyway.

The approximation derived from the asymptotic solution has a\nnegligible loss on the entire range of SNR when 2-PAM modulation is used, and\nits quantization thresholds linearly depend on the standard deviation of noise.\nWe also derive a simple estimator of the relative capacity loss due to\nquantization, based on the high-rate limit.

We derive the approximated\noptimal demodulation metrics that maximize the general cut-off rate or the\nmismatched capacity using max-log approximation . The error rate performances\nof the two metrics' assignments are compared, based on\nReed-Solomon-Viterbi(RSV) code, and the mismatched capacity metric turns out to\nbe better.

We introduce a new method of estimating undirected\nconditional independence graphs based on the score matching loss, introduced by\nHyvarinen (2005), and subsequently extended in Hyvarinen (2007). The\nregularized score matching method we propose applies to settings with\ncontinuous observations and allows for computationally efficient treatment of\npossibly non-Gaussian exponential family models. In the well-explored Gaussian\nsetting, regularized score matching avoids issues of asymmetry that arise when\napplying the technique of neighborhood selection, and compared to existing\nmethods that directly yield symmetric estimates, the score matching approach\nhas the advantage that the considered loss is quadratic and gives piecewise\nlinear solution paths under $\\ell_1$ regularization. Under suitable\nirrepresentability conditions, we show that $\\ell_1$-regularized score matching\nis consistent for graph estimation in sparse high-dimensional settings. Through\nnumerical experiments and an application to RNAseq data, we confirm that\nregularized score matching achieves state-of-the-art performance in the\nGaussian case and provides a valuable tool for computationally efficient\nestimation in non-Gaussian graphical models.\n"]}]

The DM and MOND components have a common origin, representing different\nphases of a single underlying substance. DM consists of axion-like particles\nwith mass of order eV and strong self-interactions. The condensate has a\npolytropic equation of state P~rho^3 giving rise to a superfluid core within\ngalaxies. Instead of behaving as individual collisionless particles, the DM\nsuperfluid is more aptly described as collective excitations. Superfluid\nphonons, in particular, are assumed to be governed by a MOND-like effective\naction and mediate a MONDian acceleration between baryonic matter particles.\nOur framework naturally distinguishes between galaxies (where MOND is\nsuccessful) and galaxy clusters (where MOND is not): due to the higher velocity\ndispersion in clusters, and correspondingly higher temperature, the DM in\nclusters is either in a mixture of superfluid and normal phase, or fully in the\nnormal phase. The rich and well-studied physics of superfluidity leads to a\nnumber of observational signatures: array of low-density vortices in galaxies,\nmerger dynamics that depend on the infall velocity vs phonon sound speed;\ndistinct mass peaks in bullet-like cluster mergers, corresponding to superfluid\nand normal components; interference patters in super-critical mergers.\nRemarkably, the superfluid phonon effective theory is strikingly similar to\nthat of the unitary Fermi gas, which has attracted much excitement in the cold\natom community in recent years. The critical temperature for DM superfluidity\nis of order mK, comparable to known cold atom Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","Comment: 44 pages; v2: typos corrected"]}]

The magnetic field connects the rapidly rotating central\nregion with the outer envelope and extracts angular momentum from the central\nregion during gravitational collapse of the cloud core. This process is known\nas magnetic braking. Both analytical and multidimensional simulations have\nshown that disk formation is strongly suppressed by magnetic braking in\nmoderately magnetized cloud cores in the ideal magnetohydrodynamic limit. On\nthe other hand, recent observations have provided growing evidence of a\nrelatively large disk several tens of astronomical units in size existing in\nsome Class 0 young stellar objects.

The combination of magnetic diffusion and\nthermal evolution during gravitational collapse provides a robust formation\nprocess for the circumstellar disk at the very early phase of protostar\nformation. The rotation induced by the Hall effect can supply a sufficient\namount of angular momentum for typical circumstellar disks around T Tauri\nstars.

Each possible edit operation is penalized by a\nnon-negative cost and the cost of a transformation is measured by summing the\ncosts of its operations. A solution to this problem consists in defining a\ntransformation having a minimal cost, among all possible transformations. To\ncompute such a solution, the classical approach consists in representing\nremoval and insertion operations by augmenting the two sets so that they get\nthe same size. This allows to express the problem as a linear sum assignment\nproblem (LSAP), which thus finds an optimal bijection (or permutation, perfect\nmatching) between the two augmented sets. While the LSAP is known to be\nefficiently solvable in polynomial time complexity, for instance with the\nHungarian algorithm, useless time and memory are spent to treat the elements\nwhich have been added to the initial sets. In this report, we show that the\nproblem can be formalized as an extension of the LSAP which considers only one\nadditional element in each set to represent removal and insertion operations. A\nsolution to the problem is no longer represented as a bijection between the two\naugmented sets. We show that the considered problem is a binary linear program\n(BLP) very close to the LSAP.

A well established approach valid\nfor non-equilibrium adiabatic regimes is generalized to the case where external\ntime-dependent perturbations are present. Then, a number of relevant\napplications of the method are reviewed for systems composed by a quantum dot\n(or molecule) described by a single electronic level coupled to a vibrational\nmode. Before introducing time-dependent perturbations, the range of validity of\nthe adiabatic approach is discussed showing that a very good agreement with the\nresults of an exact quantum calculation is obtained in the limit of low level\noccupation. Aim of this review has been to discuss common features of different\nsoft nanosystems under external drive. The most interesting effects induced by\ntime-dependent perturbations are obtained when the external forcing is nearly\nresonant with the slow vibrational modes. Indeed, not only the external forcing\ncan enhance the electronic response, but it also induces nonlinear regimes\nwhere the interplay between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom plays\na major role.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 14 figures"]}]

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to obtain a\nlow-dimensional representation of the shape variation in terms of the leading\nprincipal components. In this paper, we propose a generalization of SSMs,\ncalled Gaussian Process Morphable Models (GPMMs). We model the shape variations\nwith a Gaussian process, which we represent using the leading components of its\nKarhunen-Loeve expansion. To compute the expansion, we make use of an\napproximation scheme based on the Nystrom method. The resulting model can be\nseen as a continuous analogon of an SSM. However, while for SSMs the shape\nvariation is restricted to the span of the example data, with GPMMs we can\ndefine the shape variation using any Gaussian process. For example, we can\nbuild shape models that correspond to classical spline models, and thus do not\nrequire any example data. Furthermore, Gaussian processes make it possible to\ncombine different models. For example, an SSM can be extended with a spline\nmodel, to obtain a model that incorporates learned shape characteristics, but\nis flexible enough to explain shapes that cannot be represented by the SSM. We\nintroduce a simple algorithm for fitting a GPMM to a surface or image. This\nresults in a non-rigid registration approach, whose regularization properties\nare defined by a GPMM. We show how we can obtain different registration\nschemes,including methods for multi-scale, spatially-varying or hybrid\nregistration, by constructing an appropriate GPMM. As our approach strictly\nseparates modelling from the fitting process, this is all achieved without\nchanges to the fitting algorithm.

Thus, prediction\nbased on a subset model of selected covariates only can be inefficient. In this\npaper, we propose a post selection shrinkage estimation strategy to improve the\nprediction performance of a selected subset model. Such a post selection\nshrinkage estimator (PSE) is data-adaptive and constructed by shrinking a post\nselection weighted ridge estimator in the direction of a selected candidate\nsubset. Under an asymptotic distributional quadratic risk criterion, its\nprediction performance is explored analytically. We show that the proposed post\nselection PSE performs better than the post selection weighted ridge estimator.\nMore importantly, it improves the prediction performance of any candidate\nsubset model selected from most existing Lasso-type variable selection methods\nsignificantly. The relative performance of the post selection PSE is\ndemonstrated by both simulation studies and real data analysis.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 2 figures, discussion paper"]}]
