We then propose to use silent periods (zero energy\ntransmission) for transmitting the 0's in the RBN encoded data thus obtained.\nThis is in contrast to most conventional communication strategies that utilize\nenergy based transmission (EbT) schemes, where energy expenditure occurs for\ntransmitting both 0 and 1 bit values. The binary to RBN conversion algorithm\npresented here offers a significant reduction in the number of non-zero bits in\nthe resulting RBN encoded data. As a result, it provides a highly\nenergy-efficient technique for data transmission with silent periods for\ntransmitting 0's. We simulated our proposed technique with ideal radio device\ncharacteristics and also with parameters of various commercially available\nradio devices. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that with\nideal as well as some commercial device characteristics, our proposed\ntransmission scheme requires 69% less energy on an average, compared to the\nenergy based transmission schemes. This makes it very attractive for\napplication scenarios where the devices are highly energy constrained. Finally,\nbased on this transmission strategy, we have designed a MAC protocol that would\nsupport the communication of such RBN encoded data frames.\n","Comment: Conference pre-print version"]}]
