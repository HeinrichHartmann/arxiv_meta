We compute the planet's internal structure using a\nHenyey-type stellar evolution code. The planet's interactions with the\nprotoplanetary disk are calculated using 3-D hydrodynamic simulations. Previous\nmodels of Jupiter's growth have taken the radius of the planet to be\napproximately one Hill sphere radius, Rhill. However, 3-D hydrodynamic\nsimulations show that only gas within 0.25Rhill remains bound to the planet,\nwith the more distant gas eventually participating in the shear flow of the\nprotoplanetary disk. Therefore in our new simulations, the planet's outer\nboundary is placed at the location where gas has the thermal energy to reach\nthe portion of the flow not bound to the planet. We find that the smaller\nradius increases the time required for planetary growth by ~5%. Thermal\npressure limits the rate at which a planet less than a few dozen times as\nmassive as Earth can accumulate gas from the protoplanetary disk, whereas\nhydrodynamics regulates the growth rate for more massive planets. Within a\nmoderately viscous disk, the accretion rate peaks when the planet's mass is\nabout equal to the mass of Saturn. In a less viscous disk hydrodynamical limits\nto accretion are smaller, and the accretion rate peaks at lower mass. To\naccount for disk dissipation, we perform some of our simulations of Jupiter's\ngrowth within a disk whose surface gas density decreases on a timescale of\n3Myr. According to our simulations, proto-Jupiter's distended and\nthermally-supported envelope was too small to capture the planet's current\nretinue of irregular satellites as advocated by Pollack et al. (1979).\n","Comment: 17 pages 12 figures, 4 tables. To appear in the journal Icarus"]}]

Specifically, we find a single-letter formula for the\nDoF of vector ICs, encompassing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ICs,\ntime- and/or frequency-selective ICs, and combinations thereof, as well as\nscalar ICs as considered in [3]. The DoF-formula we obtain lower-bounds the DoF\nof all channels--with respect to the choice of the channel matrix--and\nupper-bounds the DoF of almost all channels. It applies to a large class of\nnoise distributions, and its proof is based on an extension of a result by\nGuionnet and Shlyakthenko [3] to the vector case in combination with the Ruzsa\ntriangle inequality for differential entropy introduced by Kontoyiannis and\nMadiman [4]. As in scalar ICs, achieving full DoF requires the use of singular\ninput distributions. Strikingly, in the vector case it suffices to enforce\nsingularity on the joint distribution of each individual transmit vector. This\ncan be realized through signaling in subspaces of the ambient signal space,\nwhich is in accordance with the idea of interference alignment, and, most\nimportantly, allows the scalar entries of the transmit vectors to have\nnon-singular distributions. The DoF-formula for vector ICs we obtain enables a\nunified treatment of \"classical\" interference alignment a la Cadambe and Jafar\n[5], and Maddah-Ali et al.

The shell transverse size of\nthe appropriate finite energy soliton can be converging to zero at infinity.\nThe ideal gas of such lightlike solitons with minimal twist parameter is\nconsidered in a finite volume. Explicit conditions provide that the angular\nmomentum of each soliton in the volume equals Planck constant. The equilibrium\nenergy spectral density for the solitons is obtained. It has the form of Planck\ndistribution in some approximation. A beam of twisted lightlike solitons is\nconsidered. The representation of arbitrary polarization for beam with twisted\nlightlike solitons is discussed. It is shown that this beam provides the effect\nof mechanical angular momentum transfer to absorbent by circularly polarized\nbeam. This effect well known for photon beam. Thus the soliton solution which\nhave determinate likeness with photon is obtained in particular.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 13 figures (acknowledgements and two references added in\n  this version)"]}]

In\nthis study, the mean first-passage time (FPT) of protein binding to its target\nlocus on DNA chain is discussed by a chain-space coupled model. Our results\nshow that the 1-dimensional diffusion constant has a critical value, with which\nthe mean time spent by a protein to find its target locus is almost independent\nof the binding rate of protein to DNA chain and the detachment rate from DNA\nchain. Which implies that, the frequency of protein binding to DNA and the\nsliding time on DNA chain have little influence on the search efficiency, and\ntherefore whether or not the 1-dimensional sliding on DNA chain increases the\nsearch efficiency depends on the 1-dimensional diffusion constant of the\nprotein on DNA chain. This study also finds that only protein bindings to DNA\nloci which are close to the target locus help to increase the search\nefficiency, while bindings to those loci which are far from the target locus\nmight delay the target binding process. As expected, the mean FPT increases\nwith the distance between the initial position of protein in cell space and its\ntarget locus on DNA chain. The direct binding probability, which can be\nregarded as one index to describe if the 1-dimensional sliding along DNA chain\nis helpful to increase the search efficiency is calculated.

This obstruction shows\nthat if the double branched cover of an alternating knot or link $L$ arises by\nsurgery on $S^3$, then for any alternating diagram the lattice associated to\nthe Goeritz matrix takes the form of a changemaker lattice. By analyzing the\nstructure of changemaker lattices, we show that the double branched cover of\n$L$ arises by non-integer surgery on $S^3$ if and only if $L$ has an\nalternating diagram which can be obtained by rational tangle replacement on an\nalmost-alternating diagram of the unknot. When one considers half-integer\nsurgery the resulting tangle replacement is simply a crossing change. This\nallows us to show that an alternating knot has unknotting number one if and\nonly if it has an unknotting crossing in every alternating diagram.\n  These techniques also produce several other interesting results: they have\napplications to characterizing slopes of torus knots; they produce a new proof\nfor a theorem of Tsukamoto on the structure of almost-alternating diagrams of\nthe unknot; and they provide several bounds on surgeries producing the double\nbranched covers of alternating knots which are direct generalizations of\nresults previously known for lens space surgeries.\n  The thesis begins with an exposition of the changemaker surgery obstruction,\ngiving an amalgamation of results due to Gibbons, Greene and the author.

In this paper,\nwe continue the study of P^QMA[log], obtaining the following results: (1) The\nP^QMA[log]-completeness result of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] above requires\nO(log(n))-local Hamiltonians and O(log(n))-local observables.

Based on the two mechanisms of homophily\nand social influence, the classical model for the dissemination of cultures\nproposed by Axelrod predicts the existence of a fragmented regime where\ndifferent cultures can coexist in a social network. However, in such model the\nmulticultural regime is achievable only when a high number of cultural traits\nis present, and is not robust against cultural drift, i.e. the spontaneous\nmutations of agents' traits. In real systems, social influence is inherently\norganised in layers, meaning that individuals tend to diversify their\nconnections according to the topic on which they interact. In this work we show\nthat the observed persistence of multiculturality in real-world social systems\nis a natural consequence of the layered organisation of social influence. We\nfind that the critical number of cultural traits that separates the\nmonocultural and the multicultural regimes depends on the redundancy of\npairwise connections across layers. Surprisingly, for low values of structural\nredundancy the system is always in a multicultural state, independently on the\nnumber of traits, and is robust to the presence of cultural drift. Moreover, we\nshow that layered social influence allows the coexistence of different levels\nof consensus on different topics. The insight obtained from simulations on\nsynthetic graphs are confirmed by the analysis of two real-world social\nnetworks, where the multicultural regime persists even for a very small number\nof cultural traits, suggesting that the layered organisation of social\ninteractions might indeed be at the heart of multicultural societies.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We consider a range of planetary masses extending from one and a\nhalf Earth's masses up to one Jupiter's mass, and we take into account\nphysically realistic gravitational potentials of forming planets. In order to\ncalculate accurately the gravitational torques exerted by disk material and to\ninvestigate the accretion process onto the planet, the flow dynamics has to be\nthoroughly resolved on long as well as short length scales. We achieve this\nstrict resolution requirement by applying a nested-grid refinement technique\nwhich allows to greatly enhance the local resolution. Our results from\naltogether 51 simulations show that for large planetary masses, approximately\nabove a tenth of the Jupiter's mass, migration rates are relatively constant,\nas expected in type II migration regime and in good agreement with previous\ntwo-dimensional calculations. In a range between seven and fifteen Earth's\nmasses, we find a dependency of the migration speed on the planetary mass that\nyields time scales considerably longer than those predicted by linear\nanalytical theories. This property may be important in determining the overall\norbital evolution of protoplanets. The growth time scale is minimum around\ntwenty Earth-masses, but it rapidly increases for both smaller and larger mass\nvalues. Significant differences between two- and three-dimensional calculations\nare found in particular for objects with masses smaller than ten Earth-masses.\nWe also derive an analytical approximation for the numerically computed mass\ngrowth rates.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 12 figures.
