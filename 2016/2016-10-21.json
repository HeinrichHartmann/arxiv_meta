When the\nquantum subsystem is weakly coupled to the spin environment, non-adiabatic\ntransitions can be neglected and one can construct an effective non-Markovian\ncomputer simulation scheme for open quantum system dynamics in classical spin\nenvironments. In order to tackle this case, integration algorithms based on the\nsymmetric Trotter factorization of the classical-like spin propagator are\nderived. Such algorithms are applied to a model comprising a quantum two-level\nsystem coupled to a single classical spin in an external magnetic field.\nStarting from an excited state, the population difference and the coherences of\nthis two-state model are simulated in time while the dynamics of the classical\nspin is monitored in detail. It is the author's opinion that the numerical\nevidence provided in this paper is a first step toward developing the\nsimulation of quantum dynamics in classical spin environments into an effective\ntool. In turn, the ability to simulate such a dynamics can have a positive\nimpact on various fields, among which, for example, nano-science.\n","Comment: To appear in Theoretical Chemistry Accounts (special issue in honor\n  of Professor Gregory Sion Ezra)"]}]

Fitting the sMLSBM to a multilayer network provides a\njoint clustering that yields node-to-community and layer-to-stratum\nassignments, which cooperatively aid one another during inference.

We implemented GST on a high-fidelity\nelectron-spin qubit confined by a single $^{31}$P atom in $^{28}$Si. The\nresults reveal systematic errors that a randomized benchmarking analysis could\nmeasure but not identify, whereas GST indicated the need for improved\ncalibration of the length of the control pulses. After introducing this\nmodification, we measured a new benchmark average gate fidelity of\n$99.942(8)\\%$, an improvement on the previous value of $99.90(2)\\%$.\nFurthermore, GST revealed high levels of non-Markovian noise in the system,\nwhich will need to be understood and addressed when the qubit is used within a\nfault-tolerant quantum computation scheme.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures. v2: Updated references and included ancillary\n  files"]}]

We simulated sphere-shaped autonomous\nrobots, within the LPZRobots simulation package, containing three weights\nmoving along orthogonal internal rods. The position of a weight is controlled\nby a single neuron receiving excitatory input from the sensor, measuring its\nactual position, and inhibitory inputs from the other two neurons. The\ninhibitory connections are transiently plastic, following physiologically\ninspired STSP-rules. We find that a wide palette of motion patterns are\ngenerated through the interaction of STSP, robot, and environment (closed-loop\nconfiguration), including various forward meandering and circular motions,\ntogether with chaotic trajectories. The observed locomotion is robust with\nrespect to additional interactions with obstacles. In the chaotic phase the\nrobot is seemingly engaged in actively exploring its environment. We believe\nthat our results constitute a concept of proof that transient synaptic\nplasticity, as described by STSP, may potentially be important for the\ngeneration of motor commands and for the emergence of complex locomotion\npatterns, adapting seamlessly also to unexpected environmental feedback. We\nobserve spontaneous and collision induced mode switchings, finding in addition,\nthat locomotion may follow transiently limit cycles which are otherwise\nunstable. Regular locomotion corresponds to stable limit cycles in the\nsensorimotor loop, which may be characterized in turn by arbitrary angles of\npropagation.

For\nreactive empirical bond-order (REBO) potential, the honeycomb structure is\nfound to be the most stable one among all permissible planar 2-D structures.\nUsing this criterion, the stable existence of graphene, silicene and germanene\nis explained.\n","Comment: 40 pages (36 main text, 1 appendix), 6 figures(5 main text, 1\n  appendix)"]}]

However, the\nclustering statistics of tracers are biased and depend on various properties of\nthe tracers themselves, such as their host-halo mass and formation and assembly\nhistory. On very large scales, where density fluctuations are within the linear\nregime, this tracer bias results in a constant offset in the clustering\namplitude, which is known as linear bias. Towards smaller non-linear scales,\nthis is no longer the case and tracer bias becomes a complicated function of\nscale and time. We focus on tracer bias centered on cosmic voids, depressions\nof the density field that spatially dominate the universe. We consider three\ndifferent types of tracers: galaxies, galaxy clusters and AGNs, extracted from\nthe hydrodynamical simulation suite Magneticum Pathfinder. In contrast to\ncommon clustering statistics that focus on the auto-correlation of tracers, we\nfind that void-tracer cross-correlations are successfully described by a linear\nbias-relation within voids. The tracer-density profile of voids can thus be\nrelated to their matter-density profile by a single number. We show that this\nnumber coincides with the linear tracer bias extracted from the large-scale\nauto-correlation function and expectations from theory, if sufficiently large\nvoids are considered. For smaller voids we observe a shift towards higher\nvalues. This has important consequences on cosmological parameter inference\nfrom large-scale structure, as the problem of unknown tracer bias is alleviated\nup to a constant number.

Time-varying droplet shapes and\ntemperature of the liquid-gas interface are measured using high-speed\nvisualization and infrared thermography, respectively. The motion of the\nparticles inside the evaporating droplet is qualitatively visualized by an\noptical microscope and profile of final particle deposit is measured by an\noptical profilometer. On a non-heated hydrophilic substrate, a ring-like\ndeposit forms after the evaporation, as reported extensively in the literature;\nwhile on a heated hydrophilic substrate, a thinner ring with an inner deposit\nis reported in the present work. The latter is attributed to Marangoni\nconvection and recorded motion of the particles as well as measured temperature\ngradient across the liquid-gas interface confirms this hypothesis. The thinning\nof the ring scales with the substrate temperature and is reasoned to stronger\nMarangoni convection at larger substrate temperature.

On the other hand, in case of a heated hydrophobic substrate,\nthe substrate heating as well as larger particle concentration helps in the\npinning of the contact line, which results in a thin ring with an inner\ndeposit. We propose a regime map for predicting three types of deposits namely,\nring, thin ring with inner deposit and inner deposit - for varying substrate\ntemperature, substrate wettability and particles concentration.

However, designing and\ntuning classical controllers, such as proportional-integral-derivative (PID)\ncontrollers, to achieve high tracking precision can be time-consuming and\ndifficult, due to hidden dynamics and other non-idealities. The Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN), with its superior capability of approximating abstract,\nnonlinear functions, proposes a novel approach for enhancing trajectory\ntracking control.

Typically, corrupt authorities that\ntry to fake the result of the tally must always be detected.\n  To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive\nZero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs).

We aim at quantifying\nthe systematic errors introduced when modelling debris discs composed of porous\ndust with a disc model assuming spherical, compact grains. We calculate the\noptical dust properties derived via the fast, but simple effective medium\ntheory. The theoretical lower boundary of the size distribution -- the\nso-called 'blowout size' -- is compared in the cases of compact and porous\ngrains. Finally, we simulate observations of hypothetical debris discs with\ndifferent porosities and feed them into a fitting procedure using only compact\ngrains. The deviations of the results for compact grains from the original\nmodel based on porous grains are analysed. We find that the blowout size\nincreases with increasing grain porosity up to a factor of two. An analytical\napproximation function for the blowout size as a function of porosity and\nstellar luminosity is derived. The analysis of the geometrical disc set-up,\nwhen constrained by radial profiles, are barely affected by the porosity.\nHowever, the determined minimum grain size and the slope of the grain size\ndistribution derived using compact grains are significantly overestimated.\nThus, the unexpectedly high ratio of minimum grain size to blowout size found\nby previous studies using compact grains can be partially described by dust\ngrain porosity, although the effect is not strong enough to completely explain\nthe trend.\n","Comment: accepted by MNRAS"]}]

The long-standing empirical rule of thumb that icebergs\ndrift at 2% of the wind velocity, relative to the ocean current, is derived\nhere from physical first principles, and it is shown that this relation only\nholds in the limit of strong winds or small icebergs, which approximately\napplies for typical icebergs in the Arctic. It is demonstrated that the\nopposite limit of weak winds or large icebergs approximately applies for\ntypical Antarctic tabular icebergs, and that in this case the icebergs simply\nmove with the ocean surface current. It is furthermore found that when winds\nare strong, wind drag drives icebergs in the direction the wind blows, whereas\nweak winds drive icebergs at a 90 degree angle to the wind direction.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Gravitational field modeling typically approximates the target body\nwith a sphere, leading to a representation in spherical harmonics. However,\nsmall celestial bodies are often irregular in shape, and hence poorly\napproximated by a sphere. A much better suited geometrical fit is achieved by a\ntri-axial ellipsoid. This is also mirrored in the fact that the associated\nharmonic expansion (ellipsoidal harmonics) shows a significantly better\nconvergence behavior as opposed to spherical harmonics. Unfortunately, complex\nmathematics and numerical problems (arithmetic overflow) so far severely\nlimited the applicability of ellipsoidal harmonics. In this paper, we present a\nmethod that allows expanding ellipsoidal harmonics to a considerably higher\ndegree compared to existing techniques. We apply this novel approach to model\nthe gravitational field of comet 67P, the final target of the Rosetta mission.\nThe comparison of results based on the ellipsoidal parameterization with those\nbased on the spheroidal and spherical approximations reveals that the latter is\nclearly inferior; the spheroidal solution, on the other hand, is virtually just\nas accurate as the ellipsoidal one. Finally, in order to generalize our\nfindings, we assess the gravitational field modeling performance for some 400\nsmall bodies in the solar system. From this investigation we generally conclude\nthat the spheroidal representation is an attractive alternative to the complex\nellipsoidal parameterization on the one hand, and the inadequate spherical\nrepresentation on the other hand.\n","Comment: published in JGR Planets"]}]

The proton NMR spectrum from a dry sample of\npolycrystalline silicon powder (1-5 $\\mu$m) shows a distinctively narrow\nLorentzian-shaped resonance with a width of 6.2 kHz, indicative of a very\nsparse distribution of protons attached to the silicon surface. These protons\nare within a few atomic monolayers of the silicon surface. The high sensitivity\nNMR detection of surface protons from low surface area ($0.26 - 1.3 \\: m^2/g$)\nparticles is enabled by an overall signal enhancement of 4150 over the room\ntemperature NMR signal at the same field. When the particles were suspended in\na solvent with 80% H2O and 20% D2O, the narrow peak was observed to grow in\nintensity over time, indicating growth of the sparse surface proton layer.\nHowever, when the particles were suspended in a solvent with 20% H2O and 80%\nD2O, the narrow bound-proton peak was observed to shrink due to exchange\nbetween the surface protons and the deuterium in solution. This decrease was\naccompanied by a concomitant growth in the intensity of the frozen solvent\npeak, as the relative proton concentration of the solvent increased. When the\nparticles were suspended in the organic solvent hexane, the proton NMR spectra\nremained unchanged over time. These results are consistent with the known\nchemisorption of water on the silicon surface resulting in the formation of\nhydride and hydroxyl species. Low-temperature DNP NMR can thus be used as a\nnon-destructive probe of surface corrosion for silicon in aqueous environments.\nThis is important in the context of using silicon MEMS and bioMEMS devices in\nsuch environments, for silicon micro- and nano-particle MRI imaging agents, and\nthe use of nanosilicon for splitting water in fuel cells.\n"]}]
