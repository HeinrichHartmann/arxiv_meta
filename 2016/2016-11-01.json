We develop a novel approach to establishing the\nconvergence of these methods, which makes use of the expression of a specific\nsolution of their subproblems and avoids the intricate issue of finding the\nexplicit expression for the Clarke subdifferential of the objective of their\nsubproblems. In particular, we show that any accumulation point of the sequence\ngenerated by the IRSVM methods is a first-order stationary point of the\nproblems. Our computational results demonstrate that the IRSVM methods\ngenerally outperform some recently developed state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof solution quality and/or speed.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to major revision and\n  corrections"]}]

However, real-time\noptimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time, this\nproblem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at\nhigh rate, hence leading to fast growth of the number of variables in the\noptimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial\nmeasurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion\nconstraints. Our first contribution is a \\emph{preintegration theory} that\nproperly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally\ndiscuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation\nnoise and derive the expression for the \\emph{maximum a posteriori} state\nestimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary\nJacobians for the optimization and a-posteriori bias correction in analytic\nform. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated IMU model can\nbe seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying\nframework of factor graphs. This enables the application of\nincremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a \\emph{structureless} model\nfor visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3D points, further\naccelerating the computation.

Combined, these comparisons provide a clear and deep account for the\nrelation between nominal and structural OO type systems that has not been\npresented before, and they help demonstrate the key value of nominal typing and\nnominal subtyping to OO developers and language designers.\n  We believe a clearer understanding of the key semantic advantage of pure\nnominal OO typing over pure structural OO typing can help remedy the existing\nschism. We believe future foundational OO PL research, to further its relevance\nto mainstream OOP, should be based less on structural models of OOP and more on\nnominal ones instead.\n","Comment: 19 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1603.08648"]}]

We define edge, node, and degreewise metamorphosis\ncoefficients, enabling a more detailed understanding of the bipartite\nconnectivity that is not explained by degree distribution alone.

Our article proposes two new fast Bayesian\napproaches for estimating high dimensional copulas with discrete margins, or a\ncombination of discrete and continuous margins.

In\nchronic psychotic patients, the representation of verbal reports as word graphs\nprovides automated sorting of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control\ngroups based on the degree of speech connectedness. Here we aim to use machine\nlearning to verify whether speech connectedness during first clinical contact\ncan predict negative symptoms and Schizophrenia diagnosis six months later.\nMethods: PANSS scores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients\nundergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis and followed for 6\nmonths to establish DSM-IV diagnosis, and 21 healthy controls. Each report was\nrepresented as a graph in which words corresponded to nodes, and node temporal\nsuccession corresponded to edges. Three connectedness attributes were extracted\nfrom each graph, z-scores to random graph distributions were measured,\ncorrelated with the PANSS negative subscale, combined into a single\nFragmentation Index, and used for predictions. Findings: Random-like speech was\nprevalent among Schizophrenia patients (64% x 5% in Control group, p=0.0002).\nConnectedness explained 92% of the PANSS negative subscale variance (p=0.0001).\nThe Fragmentation Index classified low versus high scores of PANSS negative\nsubscale with 93% accuracy (AUC=1), predicted Schizophrenia diagnosis with 89%\naccuracy (AUC=0.89), and was validated in an independent cohort of chronic\npsychotic patients. Interpretation: The structural randomness of speech graph\nconnectedness is increased in Schizophrenia. It provides a quantitative\nmeasurement of word salad as a Fragmentation Index that tightly correlates with\nnegative symptoms and predicts Schizophrenia diagnosis during first clinical\ncontact of recent-onset psychosis.\n"]}]

Then, we\nhandle the local regression tasks by using several tiny deep networks which\nsimultaneously output the bounding boxes, categories and confidence scores of\ndetected objects. To reduce the consumption of storage and computing resources,\nthe weights of the deep networks are constrained to the form of generalized\nHaar filter in training phase. Additionally, we introduce the strategy of\nsparse windows generation to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Finally,\nwe perform several experiments to validate the performance of our proposed\napproach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is both\nefficient and effective in traffic scene compared with the state-of-the-art.\n"]}]

Nonthermal radiation, such as\nphotoluminescence (PL), is a fundamental light matter interaction that\nconventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization,\nand the emission of a redshifted photon. Until recently, the role of rate\nconservation when thermal excitation is significant, has not been studied in\nany nonthermal radiation. A question: What is the overall emission rate if a\nhigh quantum efficiency (QE), PL material, is heated to a temperature where it\nthermally emits a rate of 50 photons/sec at its bend edge, while in parallel is\nPL excited at a rate of 100 photons/sec. Recently, we discovered that the\nanswer is an overall rate of 100 blueshifted photons/sec. In contrast to\nthermal emission, the PL rate is conserved with temperature increase, while\neach photon is blueshifted. Further rise in temperature leads to an abrupt\ntransition to thermal emission where the photon rate increases sharply. These\nfindings show that PL is an ideal optical heat pump. Here we study, for the\nfirst time, the emission rate of PL radiation at moderate QE where nonradiative\nprocesses dominate the dynamics. Though conservation of photon rate does not\napply, we predict that the emission rate at 100% QE is an upper limit for the\noverall emission rate regardless of the QE.

The well-known Metropolis-adjusted\nLangevin algorithm (MALA) and preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL)\nalgorithm are shown to be special cases of the marginal samplers we propose. We\nprove that marginal schemes are superior in terms of asymptotic variance, but\ndemonstrate that the acceptance ratios in auxiliary schemes can be computed an\norder of magnitude faster. In the context of latent Gaussian models we propose\nnew auxiliary and marginal samplers whose implementation requires a single\ntuning parameter, which can be found automatically during the transient phase.\nExtensive experimentation shows that the increase in efficiency (measured as\neffective sample size per unit of computing time) relative to (optimised\nimplementations of) state-of-the-art methods such as pCNL or elliptical slice\nsampling ranges from 10-fold in binary classification problems to 25-fold in\nlog-Gaussian Cox processes to 100-fold in Gaussian process regression.

An alternative approach is to use a black\nhole engineered holographic model, which displays a critical point at large\ndensities and matches lattice susceptibilities at $\\mu_{_B}\\!=\\!0$. Using the\nthermodynamic data from this black hole model, we obtain the freeze-out points\nextracted from the net-protons distribution measured at STAR and explore higher\norder fluctuations at the lowest energies at the beam energy scan to\ninvestigate signatures of the critical point.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, contribution to the proceedings of Hot Quarks\n  2016 conference at South Padre Island, TX, USA"]}]

We show that the\nelectrical ac-conductance associated to the displacement current is thus\ndirectly linked to the electrical noise summed over reservoirs, whereas the\nrelation between the thermoelectrical ac-conductance and the mixed noise\ncontains an additional term proportional to the energy step that the electrons\nmust overcome when travelling through the junction.

In\nparticular, we compare simulation results with the de Gennes theory for the\ncontact-angle effects on the liquid drop spreading on wall surfaces, and\ndemonstrate that our method produces physically accurate results.\n","Comment: 54 pages, 17 figures, 8 tables"]}]

The C[II] 158$\\mu$m fine-structure line is one of the\nbrightest emission lines of typical star-forming galaxies and a promising\ntracer of the global star-formation activity during the epoch of reionization.\nHowever, C[II] intensity maps are contaminated by interloping CO rotational\nline emission ($3 \\leq J_{\\rm upp} \\leq 6$) from lower-redshift galaxies, whose\ntotal power is a function of the population's stochasticity. Here we present a\nmodel of CO contamination from foreground galaxies to guide the masking\nstrategy of future C[II] intensity mapping experiments. The model is based on\nempirical measurements of the mean and scatter of the bolometric infrared\nluminosities, converted to CO line strengths, of galaxies at $z < 3$ and with\nstellar masses $\\rm log$$(M/\\rm M_{\\rm \\odot}) > 8$.
