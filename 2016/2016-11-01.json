We develop a novel approach to establishing the\nconvergence of these methods, which makes use of the expression of a specific\nsolution of their subproblems and avoids the intricate issue of finding the\nexplicit expression for the Clarke subdifferential of the objective of their\nsubproblems. In particular, we show that any accumulation point of the sequence\ngenerated by the IRSVM methods is a first-order stationary point of the\nproblems. Our computational results demonstrate that the IRSVM methods\ngenerally outperform some recently developed state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof solution quality and/or speed.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to major revision and\n  corrections"]}]

In this scheme, expected length of the message is equal to the\nShannon entropy of the source (with a constant additive factor) and the\nprotocol succeeds with zero error. This is a single-shot scheme from which the\nasymptotic result, viz. Shannon's source coding theorem, can be recovered by\nencoding each input state sequentially.\n  For the quantum case, the asymptotic compression rate is given by the\nvon-Neumann entropy. However, we show that there is no one-shot scheme which is\nable to match this rate, even if interactive communication is allowed.

Currently, data augmentation methods are used to carry out\ninference for discrete copula and, in practice, the computation becomes\ninfeasible when $J$ is large. Our article proposes two new fast Bayesian\napproaches for estimating high dimensional copulas with discrete margins, or a\ncombination of discrete and continuous margins. Both methods are based on\nrecent advances in Bayesian methodology that work with an unbiased estimate of\nthe likelihood rather than the likelihood itself, and our key observation is\nthat we can estimate the likelihood of a discrete copula unbiasedly with much\nless computation than evaluating the likelihood exactly or with current\nsimulation methods that are based on augmenting the model with latent\nvariables.

The second approach is based on a\nVariational Bayes approximation to the posterior and also uses an unbiased\nestimate of the likelihood. We show that Monte Carlo and randomised quasi Monte\nCarlo methods can be used with both approaches to reduce the variability of the\nestimate of the likelihood, and hence enable us to carry out Bayesian inference\nfor high values of $J$ for some classes of copulas where the computation was\npreviously too expensive.

In\nchronic psychotic patients, the representation of verbal reports as word graphs\nprovides automated sorting of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and control\ngroups based on the degree of speech connectedness. Here we aim to use machine\nlearning to verify whether speech connectedness during first clinical contact\ncan predict negative symptoms and Schizophrenia diagnosis six months later.\nMethods: PANSS scores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients\nundergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis and followed for 6\nmonths to establish DSM-IV diagnosis, and 21 healthy controls. Each report was\nrepresented as a graph in which words corresponded to nodes, and node temporal\nsuccession corresponded to edges. Three connectedness attributes were extracted\nfrom each graph, z-scores to random graph distributions were measured,\ncorrelated with the PANSS negative subscale, combined into a single\nFragmentation Index, and used for predictions. Findings: Random-like speech was\nprevalent among Schizophrenia patients (64% x 5% in Control group, p=0.0002).\nConnectedness explained 92% of the PANSS negative subscale variance (p=0.0001).\nThe Fragmentation Index classified low versus high scores of PANSS negative\nsubscale with 93% accuracy (AUC=1), predicted Schizophrenia diagnosis with 89%\naccuracy (AUC=0.89), and was validated in an independent cohort of chronic\npsychotic patients.

We focus on the role of the viscosity ratio U (between\nthe ambient fluid and the plume fluid) in determining the plume structure and\ndynamics. In our experiments, we are able to capture geophysical convection\nregimes relevant to mantle convection both for hot spots (when U > 1) and\nplate-subduction (when U < 1) regimes. The planar laser induced fluorescence\n(PLIF) technique is used for flow visualization and characterizing the plume\nstructures. The convection is driven by compositional buoyancy generated by the\nperfusion of lighter fluid across a permeable mesh and the viscosity ratio U is\nsystematically varied over a range from 1/300 to 2500. The planform, near the\nbottom boundary for U=1, exhibits a well-known dendritic line plume structure.\nAs the value of U is increased, a progressive morphological transition is\nobserved from the dendritic-plume structure to discrete spherical plumes,\naccompanied with thickening of the plumes and an increase in the plume spacing.\nIn the vertical section, mushroom-shaped plume heads at U=1 change into\nintermittent spherical-blob shaped plumes at high U, resembling mantle plume\nhot spots in mantle convection.

While great achievements have been made in identifying key\nfeatures to characterize programs, choosing a correct set of features for a\nspecific compiler task remains an ad hoc procedure. In order to guarantee a\ncomprehensive coverage of features, compiler engineers usually need to select\nexcessive number of features. This, unfortunately, would potentially lead to a\nselection of multiple similar features, which in turn could create a new\nproblem of bias that emphasizes certain aspects of a program's characteristics,\nhence reducing the accuracy and performance of the target compiler task. In\nthis paper, we propose FEAture Selection for compilation Tasks (FEAST), an\nefficient and automated framework for determining the most relevant and\nrepresentative features from a feature pool. Specifically, FEAST utilizes\nwidely used statistics and machine-learning tools, including LASSO, sequential\nforward and backward selection, for automatic feature selection, and can in\ngeneral be applied to any numerical feature set. This paper further proposes an\nautomated approach to compiler parameter assignment for assessing the\nperformance of FEAST.

Nonthermal radiation, such as\nphotoluminescence (PL), is a fundamental light matter interaction that\nconventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization,\nand the emission of a redshifted photon. Until recently, the role of rate\nconservation when thermal excitation is significant, has not been studied in\nany nonthermal radiation. A question: What is the overall emission rate if a\nhigh quantum efficiency (QE), PL material, is heated to a temperature where it\nthermally emits a rate of 50 photons/sec at its bend edge, while in parallel is\nPL excited at a rate of 100 photons/sec. Recently, we discovered that the\nanswer is an overall rate of 100 blueshifted photons/sec. In contrast to\nthermal emission, the PL rate is conserved with temperature increase, while\neach photon is blueshifted. Further rise in temperature leads to an abrupt\ntransition to thermal emission where the photon rate increases sharply. These\nfindings show that PL is an ideal optical heat pump. Here we study, for the\nfirst time, the emission rate of PL radiation at moderate QE where nonradiative\nprocesses dominate the dynamics. Though conservation of photon rate does not\napply, we predict that the emission rate at 100% QE is an upper limit for the\noverall emission rate regardless of the QE. Also, the transition temperature to\nthermal emission is QE independent.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1412.6896"]}]

In contrast to\nlower frequencies, a typical mobile millimeter wave channel consists of a few\ndominant paths. It is generally sufficient to estimate the path gains, angles\nof departure (AoD), and angles of arrival (AoA) of those paths.

For acquisition, we formulate a least squares problem and find its\nsolution based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. To track slow variations\nof AoDs and AoAs, we propose a new approach using Kalman filtering.

We\napply this to both the standard and the inside-out techniques. Our test cases,\nthe polars HU Aqr and V834 Cen, and the intermediate polar PQ Gem, were chosen\nbecause of their known accretion characteristics, namely ballistic, magnetic\nand curtain dominated accretion, respectively. In all three cases the\ninside-out tomogram better exposes low-velocity emission details which are\noverly compacted in the standard tomogram. This is especially apparent for the\nmid-inclination V834 Cen where the almost blob-like blended lower velocity\nemission in the standard tomogram is more exposed in the inside-out tomogram,\nmaking it easier to distinguish between the ballistic and magnetically confined\naccretion flows that are evident in the trailed spectra. Similarly, the\ninside-out tomogram enhances high velocity emission details which are washed\nout in the standard tomogram. This is particularly effective in revealing the\nhigh velocity magnetic accretion flows in the polars HU Aqr and V834 Cen. The\naddition of our flux modulation technique gives a significant improvement in\nreproducing the trailed input spectra adding more confidence to the\ninterpretation of the Doppler maps. Furthermore, amplitude and phase maps are\nconstructed that further reveal amplitude and phasing characteristics of the\nemission components in the three test cases.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, published in A&A"]}]

The scalar field (as in the classical Jordan-Thiry Theory) is\nconnected to the effective gravitational constant. This field is massive and\nhas Yukawa-type behaviour. We derive the equation of motion for a test particle\nfrom conservation laws in the hydrodynamic limit. We consider a truncation\nprocedure for a tower of massive scalar fields using Friedrichs' theory and an\napproximation procedure for the lagrangian involving Higgs' field. The geodetic\nequations on the Jordan-Thiry manifold are considered with an emphasis to terms\ninvolving Higgs' field.
