Caloric\neffects could be obtained by manipulating their degrees of freedom such as\nmagnetization, electric polarization and volume using a variable external\nfield. In conventional magnetocaloric refrigeration systems, the magnetocaloric\neffect is exploited by moving the active material in and out of the magnetic\nfield source. Here we demonstrate that a giant and reversible magnetocaloric\neffect can be generated simply by rotating the multiferroic TbMn2O5 single\ncrystal around its b axis in a relatively low constant magnetic field applied\nin the ac plane. For a magnetic field applied along the easy axis a, we report\nan entropy change of 12.25 J/kg K at about 10 K in a field change of 5 T which\nis 100 times larger than that found when the field is applied along the hard\naxis c. When the TbMn2O5 is rotated with the field remaining in the ac plane,\nthe associated adiabatic temperature change reaches minimum values of 8 K and\n14 K under 2 T and 5 T, respectively. This giant rotating magnetocaloric effect\nin TbMn2O5 is caused by the colossal anisotropy of the entropy change, the\nenhancement of the magnetization under relatively moderate magnetic fields and\nthe lower magnitude of specific heat. On the other hand, the application of the\ncoherent rotational model demonstrates that the rotating magnetocaloric effect\nexhibited by TbMn2O5 does not originate directly from the magneto-crystalline\nanisotropy. Our results should inspire and open new ways toward the\nimplementation of compact, efficient and embedded magnetocaloric devices for\nlow temperature and space application.

In contrast to prior works, which often released\noffline packets, including the source code of a modified Tor client and a\nsnapshot of the Internet topology, ASmoniTor is an online system that assists\nend users with mitigating the threat of AS-level adversaries in a near\nreal-time fashion. For Tor clients proposed in previous works, users need to\ncompile the source code on their machine and continually update the snapshot of\nthe Internet topology in order to obtain accurate AS-path inferences.

With ASmoniTor, the author makes three key\ntechnical contributions to the research against AS-level adversaries in the Tor\nnetwork. First, ASmoniTor does not require the users to initiate complicated\nsource code compilations. Second, it helps to reduce errors in AS-path\ninferences by letting users input a set of suspected ASes obtained directly\nfrom their own traceroute measurements. Third, the Internet topology database\nat the back-end of ASmoniTor is periodically updated to assure near real-time\nAS-path inferences between Tor exit nodes and the most likely visited websites.\nFinally, in addition to its convenience, ASmoniTor gives users full control\nover the information they want to input, thus preserving their privacy.\n","Comment: Master's thesis"]}]

In the considered model, at the demand side, it is\nassumed that customers can act as prosumers who own renewable energy sources\nand can both produce and consume energy. Due to the coupling between the\nprosumers' decisions and the stochastic nature of renewable energy, the\ninteraction among prosumers is formulated as a stochastic game, in which each\nprosumer seeks to maximize its payoff, in terms of revenues, by controlling its\nenergy consumption and demand. In particular, the subjective behavior of\nprosumers is explicitly reflected into their payoff functions using prospect\ntheory, a powerful framework that allows modeling real-life human choices. For\nthis prospect-based stochastic game, it is shown that there always exists a\nstationary Nash equilibrium where the prosumers' trading policies in the\nequilibrium are independent of the time and their histories of the play.\nMoreover, a novel distributed algorithm with no information sharing among\nprosumers is proposed and shown to converge to an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium.\nOn the other hand, at the supply side, the interaction between the utility\ncompany and the prosumers is formulated as an online optimization problem in\nwhich the utility company's goal is to learn its optimal energy allocation\nrules. For this case, it is shown that such an optimization problem admits a\nno-regret algorithm meaning that regardless of the actual outcome of the game\namong the prosumers, the utility company can follow a strategy that mitigates\nits allocation costs as if it knew the entire demand market a priori.\nSimulation results show the convergence of the proposed algorithms to their\npredicted outcomes and present new insights resulting from prospect theory that\ncontribute toward more efficient energy management in the smart grids.\n"]}]

Lower thermal\nconductivities were observed in (GaAs)0.77(Ge2)0.23 alloys; transmission\nelectron microscopy study reveals phase separation in the alloys. These alloys\ncan be interpreted as fine nanostructures, with length scales comparable to the\nperiods of very thin superlattices. Our experimental findings help gain\nfundamental insight into nanoscale thermal transport in superlattices and are\nalso useful for future improvement of thermoelectric performance using\nsuperlattice nanostructures.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The reference point is\ntypically different for each individual and originates from its past\nexperiences and future aspirations. A closed-form expression for the Bayesian\nNash equilibrium is derived for the standard game formulation. Under PT, a best\nresponse algorithm is proposed to find the equilibrium.

In this game,\nthe attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS\nto maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator\nchooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize\npotential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts\nfor the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational\ncapabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such\nbounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from\nthe behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed.

The main technical\ntool used in this paper is a relativisation technique where ordinal analysis is\ncarried out relative to an arbitrary but fixed set x. A classic result from\nordinal analysis is the characterisation of the provably recursive functions of\nPeano Arithmetic, PA, by means of the fast growing hierarchy [10]. Whilst it is\npossible to formulate the natural numbers within KP, the theory speaks\nprimarily about sets. For this reason it is desirable to obtain a\ncharacterisation of its provably total set functions. We will show that KP\nproves the totality of a set function precisely when it falls within a\nhierarchy of set functions based upon a relativised constructible hierarchy\nstretching up in length to any ordinal below the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. As a\nconsequence of this result we obtain that IKP + forall x,y (x in y or x not in\ny) is conservative over KP for forall-exists-formulae, where IKP stands for\nintuitionistic Kripke-Platek set theory. In a similar vein, utilising [56], it\nis shown that KP(P) proves the totality of a set function precisely when it\nfalls within a hierarchy of set functions based upon a relativised von Neumann\nhierarchy of the same length. The relativisation technique applied to KP(P)\nwith the global axiom of choice, AC-global, also yields a parameterised\nextension of a result in [58], showing that KP(P) + AC-global is conservative\nover KP(P) + AC and CZF + AC for Pi_2 in powerset statements.

A special class of GOIs originates from the superposition of a\nsimple geometric figure (\"target\") with an array of non-intersecting\ncurvilinear elements (\"context\") that elicits a perceptual distortion of the\ntarget element. Here we specifically deal with the case of circular targets.\nStarting from the fact that (half)circles are geodesics in a model of\nhyperbolic geometry, we conceive of the deformations of the target as resulting\nfrom a context-induced perturbation of that \"base\" geometry. We present\ncomputational methods for predicting distorted shapes of the target in\ndifferent contexts, and we report the results of a psychophysical pilot\nexperiment with eight subjects and four contexts to test the predictions.\nFinally, we propose a common scheme for modeling GOIs associated with more\ngeneral types of target curves, subsuming those studied previously.\n","Comment: Preprint version of journal article"]}]

We also introduce a new metric for evaluating confidence\nestimation systems that can capture new aspects of their performance.\nEvaluation of CONE on Android phones in a typical testbed using the iBeacons\nBLE technology with a side-by-side comparison with traditional confidence\nestimation techniques shows that CONE can achieve a consistent median absolute\nerror difference accuracy of less than 2.7m while estimating the user position\nmore than 80% of the time within the confidence circle. This is significantly\nbetter than the state-of-the-art confidence estimation systems that are\ntailored to the specific localization system in use. Moreover, CONE does not\nrequire any calibration and therefore provides a scalable and ubiquitous\nconfidence estimation system for pervasive applications.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in IPIN 2016 - International Conference on\n  Indoor Positioning and Indoor Navigation 2016 6 pages, 9 figures"]}]

In this\npaper we propose a mathematical and computational model to study the behavior\nof microcirculatory networks subjected to different conditions. The network\ngeometry is composed of a graph of connected straight cylinders, each one\nrepresenting a vessel. The blood flow and pressure drop across the single\nvessel, further split into smaller elements, are related through a generalized\nOhm's law featuring a conductivity parameter, function of the vessel cross\nsection area and geometry, which undergo deformations under pressure loads.

With our generic\nformalism, we obtain several results on membrane dynamics. We find that\nproteins that span the bilayer increase the intermonolayer friction\ncoefficient.

Second, we find that asymmetric proteins\ncouple to the membrane curvature and to the difference in monolayer densities.\nFor practically all accessible membrane tensions ($\\sigma> 10^{-8}$ N/m) we\nshow that the protein density is the slowest relaxing variable. Furthermore,\nits relaxation rate decreases at small wavelengths due to the coupling to\ncurvature. We apply our formalism to the large-scale diffusion of a\nconcentrated protein patch.
