The Lagrangian is the sum a mechanical one and of a\nmagnetic one. This magnetic Lagrangian is expressed in terms of rotor angle,\ncomplex stator and rotor currents. A complexification procedure widely used in\nquantum electrodynamic is applied here in order to derive the Euler-Lagrange\nequations with complex stator and rotor currents. Such complexification process\navoids the usual separation into real and imaginary parts and simplifies\nnotably the calculations. Via simple modifications of such magnetic Lagrangians\nwe derive new dynamical models describing permanent-magnet machines with both\nsaturation and saliency, and induction machines with both magnetic saturation\nand space harmonics. For each model we also provide its Hamiltonian thus its\nmagnetic energy. This energy is also expressed with complex currents and can be\ndirectly used in Lyapunov and/or passivity based control. Further, we briefly\ninvestigate the observability of this class of Euler-Lagrange models, in the\nso-called sensorless case when the measured output is the stator current and\nthe load torque is constant but unknown. For all the dynamical models obtained\nvia such variational principles, we prove that their linear tangent systems are\nunobservable around a one-dimensional family of steady-states attached to the\nsame constant stator voltage and current.

We conduct a comprehensive comparison between two\nsub-Nyquist acquisition strategies for spectrally-sparse signals, the random\ndemodulator and the modulated wideband converter (MWC), in terms of these\nmetrics and draw operative conclusions regarding the choice of analog\ncompression.

Several variations on the basic theme have been proposed\nto date, all of which share the good performance characteristics of\nconvolutional LDPC ensembles. We describe the fundamental mechanism which\nexplains why \"convolutional-like\" or \"spatially coupled\" codes perform so well.\nIn essence, the spatial coupling of the individual code structure has the\neffect of increasing the belief-propagation (BP) threshold of the new ensemble\nto its maximum possible value, namely the maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) threshold\nof the underlying ensemble. For this reason we call this phenomenon \"threshold\nsaturation.\" This gives an entirely new way of approaching capacity. One\nsignificant advantage of such a construction is that one can create\ncapacity-approaching ensembles with an error correcting radius which is\nincreasing in the blocklength. Our proof makes use of the area theorem of the\nBP-EXIT curve and the connection between the MAP and BP threshold recently\npointed out by Measson, Montanari, Richardson, and Urbanke. Although we prove\nthe connection between the MAP and the BP threshold only for a very specific\nensemble and only for the binary erasure channel, empirically a threshold\nsaturation phenomenon occurs for a wide class of ensembles and channels.

A distributed control law is examined: the control action\non an individual vehicle depends on (i) its own velocity and (ii) the relative\nposition measurements with a small subset of vehicles (neighbors) in the\nformation. The neighbors are defined according to an information graph.\n  In this paper we describe a methodology for modeling, analysis, and\ndistributed control design of such vehicular formations whose information graph\nis a D-dimensional lattice. The modeling relies on an approximation based on a\npartial differential equation (PDE) that describes the spatio-temporal\nevolution of position errors in the formation. The analysis and control design\nis based on the PDE model. We deduce asymptotic formulae for the closed-loop\nstability margin (absolute value of the real part of the least stable\neigenvalue) of the controlled formation. The stability margin is shown to\napproach 0 as the number of vehicles N goes to infinity. The exponent on the\nscaling law for the stability margin is influenced by the dimension and the\nstructure of the information graph.

In this study, we tackle this\nchallenge for smart grid with integrated wind generation, by leveraging\nmulti-timescale dispatch and scheduling. Specifically, we consider smart grids\nwith two classes of energy users - traditional energy users and opportunistic\nenergy users (e.g., smart meters or smart appliances), and investigate pricing\nand dispatch at two timescales, via day-ahead scheduling and realtime\nscheduling. In day-ahead scheduling, with the statistical information on wind\ngeneration and energy demands, we characterize the optimal procurement of the\nenergy supply and the day-ahead retail price for the traditional energy users;\nin realtime scheduling, with the realization of wind generation and the load of\ntraditional energy users, we optimize real-time prices to manage the\nopportunistic energy users so as to achieve systemwide reliability.

For the\npurpose of exposition, we study the classic three-node Gaussian relay channel\nwith decode-and-forward (DF) relaying, in which the source and relay nodes\ntransmit with power drawn from energy-harvesting (EH) sources. Assuming a\ndeterministic EH model under which the energy arrival time and the harvested\namount are known prior to transmission, the throughput maximization problem\nover a finite horizon of $N$ transmission blocks is investigated. In\nparticular, two types of data traffic with different delay constraints are\nconsidered: delay-constrained (DC) traffic (for which only one-block decoding\ndelay is allowed at the destination) and no-delay-constrained (NDC) traffic\n(for which arbitrary decoding delay up to $N$ blocks is allowed). For the DC\ncase, we show that the joint source and relay power allocation over time is\nnecessary to achieve the maximum throughput, and propose an efficient algorithm\nto compute the optimal power profiles. For the NDC case, although the\nthroughput maximization problem is non-convex, we prove the optimality of a\nseparation principle for the source and relay power allocation problems, based\nupon which a two-stage power allocation algorithm is developed to obtain the\noptimal source and relay power profiles separately. Furthermore, we compare the\nDC and NDC cases, and obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions under\nwhich the NDC case performs strictly better than the DC case. It is shown that\nNDC transmission is able to exploit a new form of diversity arising from the\nindependent source and relay energy availability over time in cooperative\ncommunication, termed \"energy diversity\", even with time-invariant channels.\n","Comment: appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, special\n  issue on theories and methods for advanced wireless relays"]}]

HAS comes with\ntwo unique flavors. First, by riding on top of HTTP/TCP, it leverages the\nnetwork-friendly TCP to achieve firewall/NATS traversal and bandwidth sharing.\nSecond, by pre-encoding and storing the video in a number of discrete bitrate\nlevels, it introduces video bitrate adaptivity in a scalable way that the video\nencoding is excluded from the closed-loop adaptation. A conventional wisdom is\nthat the TCP throughput observed by a HAS client indicates the available\nnetwork bandwidth, thus can be used as a reliable reference for the video\nbitrate selection.\n  We argue that this no longer holds true when HAS becomes a substantial\nfraction of the Internet traffic. We show that when multiple HAS clients\ncompete at a network bottleneck, the presence of competing clients and the\ndiscrete nature of the video bitrates would together create confusion for a\nclient to correctly perceive its fair-share bandwidth. Through analysis and\nreal experiments, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation would lead\nto, for example, video rate oscillation that negatively impacts the video\nwatching experiences. We therefore argue that it is necessary to implement at\nthe application layer a \"probe-and-adapt\" mechanism for HAS video rate\nadaptation, which is akin but orthogonal to the transport-layer network rate\nadaptation achieved by TCP. We present PANDA -- a client-side rate adaptation\nalgorithm for HAS -- as an embodiment of this idea.

SDR-based beamforming has been\nshown to be promising for a small or moderate number of users. This paper\ndescribes two new transceiver strategies for physical-layer multicasting.

The use of channel coding and the\nassumption of sufficiently long code lengths play a crucial role in achieving\nthe above result.

If a node fails, any d out of (n-1) nodes help in the repair of\nthe failed node. For such a (n,k,d)-DSS, two types of wiretapping scenarios are\ninvestigated: (a) Type-I (node) adversary which can wiretap the data stored on\nany l<k nodes; and a more severe (b) Type-II (repair data) adversary which can\nwiretap the contents of the repair data that is used to repair a set of l\nfailed nodes over time.

In other\nwords, we will introduce a constraint that PAPR cannot exceed a predetermined\nthreshold. By adding the aforementioned constraint into the CCPA optimization\nframework, the power efficiency of a power amplifier (PA) can be significantly\nenhanced by enabling it to operate on its linear operation range. Hence, PAPR\nconstraint is especially beneficial for power limited cell-edge users. In this\npaper, we will derive the instantaneous PAPR constraint as a function of\ntransmit power allocation. Furthermore, successive convex approximation is\nderived for the PAPR constrained problem. Numerical results show that the\nproposed method can achieve the objectives described above.\n","Comment: Presented in IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)\n  2014"]}]

To collect massive sensitive data from\nusers, we propose a reward-based collaboration mechanism, where the master\nannounces a total reward to be shared among collaborators, and the\ncollaboration is successful if there are enough users wanting to collaborate.\nWe show that if the master knows the users' collaboration costs, then he can\nchoose to involve only users with the lowest costs. However, without knowing\nusers' private information, then he needs to offer a larger total reward to\nattract enough collaborators. Users will benefit from knowing their costs\nbefore the data acquisition. Perhaps surprisingly, the master may benefit as\nthe variance of users' cost distribution increases.\n  To utilize smartphones' computation resources to solve complex computing\nproblems, we study how the master can design an optimal contract by specifying\ndifferent task-reward combinations for different user types.

In our approach, we first propose\nsub-modular formulations for the hashing binary code inference problem and an\nefficient GraphCut based block search method for solving large-scale inference.\nThen we learn hash functions by training boosted decision trees to fit the\nbinary codes. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method significantly\noutperforms most state-of-the-art methods in retrieval precision and training\ntime. Especially for high-dimensional data, our method is orders of magnitude\nfaster than many methods in terms of training time.\n","Comment: Appearing in Proc. IEEE Conf.

Hence, to the best of our\nknowledge, the analysis of this queueing model remains quite uncharted.\n  Recent traces from Amazon S3 show that the time to retrieve a fixed size\nchunk is random and can be approximated as a constant delay plus an i.i.d.\nexponentially distributed random variable. For the tractability of the\ntheoretical analysis, we assume that the chunk downloading time is i.i.d.\nexponentially distributed. Under this assumption, we show that any\nwork-conserving scheme is delay-optimal among all on-line scheduling schemes\nwhen k = 1. When k > 1, we find that a simple greedy scheme, which allocates\nall available threads to the head of line request, is delay optimal among all\non-line scheduling schemes. We also provide some numerical results that point\nto the limitations of the exponential assumption, and suggest further research\ndirections.\n","Comment: Original accepted by IEEE Infocom 2014, 9 pages.

Furthermore, we derive a\nscaling law between the gap to capacity, the cardinality of the input and\noutput alphabets, and the required size of the mapper.\n  The second one is an integrated scheme in which the code is used both for\nsource coding, in order to create codewords distributed according to the\ncapacity-achieving input distribution, and for channel coding, in order to\nprovide error protection.

Subsequently, we determine the effective capacity region of this\nchannel model, and we attain the power allocation policies that maximize this\nregion. Finally, we present the numerical results. We first show the\nsuperiority of Majority rule when the channel sensing results are good. Then,\nwe illustrate that a greedy transmission rate approach is more beneficial for\nthe SUs under strict interference power constraints, whereas sending with lower\nrates will be more advantageous under loose interference constraints.\n","Comment: Submitted and Accepted to IEEE Globecom 2014"]}]

The proposed\nalgorithms transform the nonconvex problems into a sequence of convex problems,\neach of which is solved very efficiently by the interior-point method. We prove\nthat our algorithms converge to the locally optimal solutions that satisfy the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the original nonconvex problems. We then\nextend our results to the case of decode-and-forward (DF) relaying with\nvariable timeslot durations. We show that our resource allocation solutions in\nthis case offer better throughput than that of the AF counterpart with equal\ntimeslot durations, albeit at a higher computational complexity. Numerical\nresults confirm that the proposed joint optimization solutions substantially\nimprove the network performance, compared with cases where the radio resource\nparameters are individually optimized.\n"]}]

We introduce a design metric called 'side information\ngain' that measures the advantage of a code in utilizing the side information\nat the receivers, and hence its goodness as an index code. Based on the Chinese\nremainder theorem, we then construct lattice index codes with large side\ninformation gains using lattices over the following principal ideal domains:\nrational integers, Gaussian integers, Eisenstein integers, and the Hurwitz\nquaternions. Among all lattice index codes constructed using any densest\nlattice of a given dimension, our codes achieve the maximum side information\ngain. Finally, using an example, we illustrate how the proposed lattice index\ncodes can benefit Gaussian broadcast channels with more general message\ndemands.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory.

Since most of the\ntarget WSN applications are very sensitive, security issue is one of the major\nchallenges in the deployment of WSN. One of the important building blocks in\nsecuring WSN is key management. Traditional key management solutions developed\nfor other networks are not suitable for WSN since WSN networks are resource\n(e.g. memory, computation, energy) limited. Key pre-distribution algorithms\nhave recently evolved as efficient alternatives of key management in these\nnetworks. In the key pre-distribution systems, secure communication is achieved\nbetween a pair of nodes either by the existence of a key allowing for direct\ncommunication or by a chain of keys forming a key-path between the pair. In\nthis paper, we propose methods which bring prior knowledge of network\ncharacteristics and application constraints into the design of key\npre-distribution schemes, in order to provide better security and connectivity\nwhile requiring less resources. Our methods are based on casting the prior\ninformation as a graph. Motivated by this idea, we also propose a class of\nquasi-symmetric designs referred here to as g-designs.

The proposed framework consists of a\ndense feature extractor and detectors of three important classes. Once the\ndense features have been extracted, these features are shared with all\ndetectors. The advantage of using one common framework is that the detection\nspeed is much faster, since all dense features need only to be evaluated once\nin the testing phase.

To enhance the\nfeature robustness to noises and image deformations, we introduce spatially\npooled features as a part of aggregated channel features.

In particular, using the fact that splitting may be\nunnecessary when the reliability of decoding the unfrozen bit is sufficiently\nhigh, a novel splitting rule is proposed. Based on this rule, it is conjectured\nthat, if the correct path survives at some stage, it tends to survive till\ntermination without splitting with high probability. On the other hand, the\nincorrect paths are more likely to split at the following stages. Motivated by\nthese observations, a simple counter that counts the successive number of\nstages without splitting is introduced for each decoding path to facilitate the\nidentification of correct and incorrect path. Specifically, any path with\ncounter value larger than a predefined threshold \\omega is deemed to be the\ncorrect path, which will survive at the decoding stage, while other paths with\ncounter value smaller than the threshold will be pruned, thereby reducing the\ndecoding complexity. Furthermore, it is proved that there exists a unique\nunfrozen bit u_{N-K_1+1}, after which the successive cancellation decoder\nachieves the same error performance as the maximum likelihood decoder if all\nthe prior unfrozen bits are correctly decoded, which enables further complexity\nreduction.

Our proposed method\nhas several distinguished advantages over conventional formulations (e.g., the\nwell-known backward Euler with Newton-Raphson method). The matrix factorization\nis performed only for the conductance/resistance matrix G, without being\nperformed for the combinations of the capacitance/inductance matrix C and\nmatrix G, which are used in traditional implicit formulations. Furthermore, due\nto the explicit nature of our formulation, we do not need to repeat LU\ndecompositions when adjusting the length of time steps for error controls. Our\nalgorithm is better suited to solving tightly coupled post-layout circuits in\nthe pursuit for full-chip simulation. Our experimental results validate the\nadvantages of our framework.\n","Comment: 6 pages; ACM/IEEE DAC 2015"]}]

This shows that there exist networks where sharing even a\nnegligible number of bits per channel use with the encoders yields a\nnon-negligible benefit.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 3 figures.

Caching popular videos in the\nstorage of small-cell base stations (SBS), namely, small-cell caching, is an\nefficient technology for reducing the transmission latency whilst mitigating\nthe redundant transmissions of popular videos over back-haul channels. In this\npaper, we consider a commercialized small-cell caching system consisting of a\nnetwork service provider (NSP), several video retailers (VR), and mobile users\n(MU). The NSP leases its SBSs to the VRs for the purpose of making profits, and\nthe VRs, after storing popular videos in the rented SBSs, can provide faster\nlocal video transmissions to the MUs, thereby gaining more profits. We conceive\nthis system within the framework of Stackelberg game by treating the SBSs as a\nspecific type of resources. We first model the MUs and SBSs as two independent\nPoisson point processes, and develop, via stochastic geometry theory, the\nprobability of the specific event that an MU obtains the video of its choice\ndirectly from the memory of an SBS. Then, based on the probability derived, we\nformulate a Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the average profit of both the\nNSP and the VRs. Also, we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium by solving a\nnon-convex optimization problem. With the aid of this game theoretic framework,\nwe shed light on the relationship between four important factors: the optimal\npricing of leasing an SBS, the SBSs allocation among the VRs, the storage size\nof the SBSs, and the popularity distribution of the VRs.

The\nimplementation of the algorithm only requires to solve a deterministic problem\nin each time slot, for which the optimal solution can be obtained either in\nclosed form or by bisection search. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown\nto be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis.

Our goal is to obtain an\nestimate of the number of SCs required to maintain a target outage rate. Such\nan analysis is trivial if the MCs are located according to a Poisson point\nprocess (PPP), which provides a lower bound on performance. Here, we consider\nMCs placed on a hexagonal grid, which complements the PPP model by providing an\nupper bound on performance. We first provide accurate bounds for the average\ninterference within a MC when SCs are not used. Then, by obtaining the outage\nareas, we estimate the number of SCs required within an MC to overcome outage.\nIf resource allocation amongst SCs is not used, we show that the problem of\noutage is not solved completely, and the residual outage area depends on\nwhether co-channel or orthogonal SCs are used.

By penalising the distance and the relative\nrotation between neighbouring triangles our matching compromises between the\nimage and the shape information.

To our\nknowledge this is the first combinatorial formulation for non-rigid 3D\nshape-to-image matching.

The occlusions incurred by random\nmeshes severely degenerate the performance of face verification systems, which\nraises the MeshFace verification problem between MeshFace and daily photos.\nPrevious methods cast this problem as a typical low-level vision problem, i.e.\nblind inpainting. They recover perceptually pleasing clear ID photos from\nMeshFaces by enforcing pixel level similarity between the recovered ID images\nand the ground-truth clear ID images and then perform face verification on\nthem. Essentially, face verification is conducted on a compact feature space\nrather than the image pixel space. Therefore, this paper argues that pixel\nlevel similarity and feature level similarity jointly offer the key to improve\nthe verification performance. Based on this insight, we offer a novel feature\noriented blind face inpainting framework. Specifically, we implement this by\nestablishing a novel DeMeshNet, which consists of three parts. The first part\naddresses blind inpainting of the MeshFaces by implicitly exploiting extra\nsupervision from the occlusion position to enforce pixel level similarity. The\nsecond part explicitly enforces a feature level similarity in the compact\nfeature space, which can explore informative supervision from the feature space\nto produce better inpainting results for verification. The last part copes with\nface alignment within the net via a customized spatial transformer module when\nextracting deep facial features. All the three parts are implemented within an\nend-to-end network that facilitates efficient optimization. Extensive\nexperiments on two MeshFace datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed DeMeshNet as well as the insight of this paper.\n","Comment: 10pages, submitted to CVPR 17"]}]

While conventional LDPC\ncodes are sensitively tuned to operate efficiently at a certain channel\nparameter, the proposed bilayer LDPC codes are capable of working at two\ndifferent channel parameters and two different rates: that at the relay and at\nthe destination. To analyze the performance of bilayer LDPC codes, bilayer\ndensity evolution is devised as an extension of the standard density evolution\nalgorithm. Based on bilayer density evolution, a design methodology is\ndeveloped for the bilayer codes in which the degree distribution is iteratively\nimproved using linear programming. Further, in order to approach the\ntheoretical decode-and-forward rate for a wide range of channel parameters,\nthis paper proposes two different forms bilayer codes, the bilayer-expurgated\nand bilayer-lengthened codes.

The form of these\ngeneral private states are given, and we show that there are a number of useful\nways of expressing them. Some of the private states can be approximated by\ncertain states which are bound entangled. Thus distillable entanglement is not\na requirement for a private key.

We also find a general class of states which have negative partial\ntranspose (are NPT), but which appear to be bound entangled.

Recently, many theoretical efforts have been made on\nthis topic and have theoretically predicted the high performance of decoy\nmethod. However, the gap between theory and experiment remains open. In this\npaper, we report the first experiments on decoy state QKD, thus bridging the\ngap. Two protocols of decoy state QKD are implemented: one-decoy protocol over\n15km of standard telecom fiber, and weak+vacuum protocol over 60km of standard\ntelecom fiber. We implemented the decoy state method on a modified commercial\nQKD system. The modification we made is simply adding commercial acousto-optic\nmodulator (AOM) on the QKD system. The AOM is used to modulate the intensity of\neach signal individually, thus implementing the decoy state method. As an\nimportant part of implementation, numerical simulation of our set-up is also\nperformed. The simulation shows that standard security proofs give a zero key\ngeneration rate at the distance we perform decoy state QKD (both 15km and\n60km).
