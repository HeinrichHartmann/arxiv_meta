Of particular importance is the case where f(X)\nis a function of independent random variables X=(X_1, ..., X_n). Here the well\nknown bounded differences inequality (also called McDiarmid's or\nHoeffding-Azuma inequality) establishes sharp concentration if the function f\ndoes not depend too much on any of the variables. One attractive feature is\nthat it relies on a very simple Lipschitz condition (L): it suffices to show\nthat |f(X)-f(X')| \\leq c_k whenever X,X' differ only in X_k. While this is easy\nto check, the main disadvantage is that it considers worst-case changes c_k,\nwhich often makes the resulting bounds too weak to be useful.\n  In this paper we prove a variant of the bounded differences inequality which\ncan be used to establish concentration of functions f(X) where (i) the typical\nchanges are small although (ii) the worst case changes might be very large. One\nkey aspect of this inequality is that it relies on a simple condition that (a)\nis easy to check and (b) coincides with heuristic considerations why\nconcentration should hold. Indeed, given an event \\Gamma that holds with very\nhigh probability, we essentially relax the Lipschitz condition (L) to\nsituations where \\Gamma occurs. The point is that the resulting typical changes\nc_k are often much smaller than the worst case ones.\n  To illustrate its application we consider the reverse H-free process, where H\nis 2-balanced. We prove that the final number of edges in this process is\nconcentrated, and also determine its likely value up to constant factors. This\nanswers a question of Bollob\\'as and Erd\\H{o}s.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

Among the existing techniques used for i.i.d.\nobservations, the multiplier bootstrap of R\\'{e}millard and Scaillet (J.\nMultivariate Anal. 100 (2009) 377-386) frequently appears to lead to inference\nprocedures with the best finite-sample properties. B\\\"{u}cher and Ruppert (J.\nMultivariate Anal. 116 (2013) 208-229) recently proposed an extension of this\ntechnique to strictly stationary strongly mixing observations by adapting the\ndependent multiplier bootstrap of B\\\"{u}hlmann (The blockwise bootstrap in time\nseries and empirical processes (1993) ETH Z\\\"{u}rich, Section 3.3) to the\nempirical copula process. The main contribution of this work is a\ngeneralization of the multiplier resampling scheme proposed by B\\\"{u}cher and\nRuppert along two directions. First, the resampling scheme is now genuinely\nsequential, thereby allowing to transpose to the strongly mixing setting many\nof the existing multiplier tests on the unknown copula, including nonparametric\ntests for change-point detection. Second, the resampling scheme is now fully\nautomatic as a data-adaptive procedure is proposed which can be used to\nestimate the bandwidth parameter. A simulation study is used to investigate the\nfinite-sample performance of the resampling scheme and provides suggestions on\nhow to choose several additional parameters. As by-products of this work, the\nvalidity of a sequential version of the dependent multiplier bootstrap for\nempirical processes of B\\\"{u}hlmann is obtained under weaker conditions on the\nstrong mixing coefficients and the multipliers, and the weak convergence of the\nsequential empirical copula process is established under many serial dependence\nconditions.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.3150/14-BEJ682 in the Bernoulli\n  (http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/) by the International Statistical\n  Institute/Bernoulli Society (http://isi.cbs.nl/BS/bshome.htm)"]}]

We define these estimators by estimating a non-parametric\nconditional density estimates and minimizing a disparity between this estimate\nand the parametric model averaged over values of $x$. The consistency and\nasymptotic normality of such estimators is demonstrated for a broad class of\nmodels in which response and covariate vectors can take both discrete and\ncontinuous values and incorportates a wide set of choices for kernel-based\nconditional density estimation. It also establishes the robustness of these\nestimators for a broad class of disparities. As has been observed in Tamura and\nBoos (J. Amer. Statist.

The Planck\nall-sky maps of linearly polarized emission from dust at 353GHz provide the\nrequired combination of imaging and statistics to study the correlation between\nthe structures of the Galactic magnetic field and of interstellar matter, both\nin the diffuse ISM and in molecular clouds. The data reveal structures, or\nridges, in the intensity map with counterparts in the Stokes Q and/or U maps.\nWe focus on structures at intermediate and high Galactic latitudes with column\ndensity from $10^{20}$ to $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. We measure the magnetic field\norientation on the plane of the sky from the polarization data, and present an\nalgorithm to estimate the orientation of the ridges from the dust intensity\nmap. We use analytical models to account for projection effects. Comparing\npolarization angles on and off the structures, we estimate the mean ratio\nbetween the strengths of the turbulent and mean components of the magnetic\nfield to be between 0.6 and 1.0, with a preferred value of 0.8. We find that\nthe ridges are preferentially aligned with the magnetic field measured on the\nstructures. This trend becomes more striking for increasing polarization\nfraction and decreasing column density. We interpret the increase of alignment\nwith polarization fraction as a consequence of projections effects. The\ndecrease of alignment for high column density is not due to a loss of\ncorrelation between the structures and the geometry of the magnetic field. In\nmolecular complexes, we observe structures perpendicular to the magnetic field,\nwhich cannot be accounted for by projection effects.

These differences for Musca and L1506 are larger than the\ndispersions of psi, both along the filaments and in their backgrounds. The\nobserved changes of psi are direct evidence for variations of the orientation\nof the plane of the sky (POS) projection of the B-field. As in previous\nstudies, we find a decrease of several percent of p with NH. We show that the\ndrop in p cannot be explained by random fluctuations of the orientation of B\nwithin the filaments because they are too small (sigma_psi<10deg). We recognize\nthe degeneracy between dust alignment efficiency and the structure of B in\ncausing variations in p, but we argue that the decrease of p from the\nbackgrounds to the filaments results in part from depolarization associated\nwith the 3D structure of B: both its orientation in the POS and with respect to\nthe POS.

In the regime\nof enhanced scaling the optimal measurement whose precision is given by the QFI\ninvolves measuring both system and output.

The dust shell that surrounds the Rosette HII\nregion is clearly observed in the Planck intensity map at 353 GHz, with a\npolarization signal significantly different from that of the local background\nwhen considered as a whole. The Planck observations constrain the\nplane-of-the-sky orientation of the magnetic field in the Rosette's parent\nmolecular cloud to be mostly aligned with the large-scale field along the\nGalactic plane. The Planck data are compared with the analytical model, which\npredicts the mean polarization properties of a spherical and uniform dust shell\nfor a given orientation of the field.

Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol is\ngood for a given situation. Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, on\nthe other hand, is almost impossible. Using the intuition that the protocols in\nthe same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to\nintroduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the given\nrequirements from the category that performs better for a given context. We\ndefine the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance\nof different categories protocols for different contexts.

The depth basis captures spatial and statistical\nregularities and reduces the problem of global depth estimation to the task of\npredicting the input-specific coefficients in the linear combination. This is\nformulated as a regression problem from a holistic representation of the image.\nCrucially, the depth basis and the regression function are {\\bf coupled} and\njointly optimized by our learning scheme. We demonstrate that this results in a\nsignificant improvement in accuracy compared to direct regression of depth\npixel values or approaches learning the depth basis disjointly from the\nregression function. The global depth estimate is then used as a guidance by a\nlocal refinement method that introduces depth details that were not captured at\nthe global level.

The column densities in the selected regions range from $N_H\n\\approx 10^{21}$ to $10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, and hence they correspond to the bulk\nof the molecular clouds. The relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixel\nand analyzed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called\n\"Histogram of Relative Orientations\". Throughout this study, we assume that the\npolarized emission observed by Planck at 353 GHz is representative of the\nprojected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, i.e., we assume a\nconstant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment.\nWithin most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressively\nwith increasing $N_H$, from preferentially parallel or having no preferred\norientation to preferentially perpendicular. In simulations of\nmagnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relative\norientation is a signature of Alfv\\'enic or sub-Alfv\\'enic turbulence, implying\nthat the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scales\nprobed by Planck.

For the best characterized organic superconductors of\nk-(BEDT-TTF)2X (X=anion), a first order transition between AFM insulator and\nsuperconductor can be tuned by applied external pressure or chemical pressure.\nAlso, the superconducting state can be directly developed from AFM insulator by\napplication of pressure in Cs3C60.

Interactions\nsuppress spin density wave order, and favor a superfluid \\textit{only} at the\nBrillouin zone edge. This state has spatially oscillating mean field order\nparameters, but a homogeneous density. We show that the spin density wave\nsuperfluid phase survives in a two dimensional harmonic trap, and thus\nestablish that our results are directly applicable to experiments on $^{87}$Rb,\n$^7$Li, and $^{41}$K.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, replaced with published version"]}]

This situation holds at any radius because the motion of a shell\nin a spherically symmetric system is not affected by the outside.

The line emission is mostly due to i) a large scale ionisation cone\nenergised by the AGN, ii) a Ly-alpha emitting bridge of gas between the radio\ngalaxy and a heavily star-forming set of components. Strangely, the ionisation\ncone has no Ly-alpha emission. We find this is due to an optically thick layer\nof neutral gas with unity covering fraction spread out over a region of at\nleast ~100kpc from the AGN. Other, less thick absorption components are\nassociated with Ly-alpha emitting gas within a few tens of kpc from the radio\ngalaxy and are connected by a bridge of emission. We speculate that this linear\nstructure of dust, Ly-alpha and CO emission, and the redshifted absorption seen\nin the circum-nuclear region may represent an accretion flow feeding gas into\nthis massive AGN host galaxy.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

From RV observations a dearth of\ncompanions with masses between 10-40 MJup has been noticed at close\nseparations, suggesting the possibility of a distinct formation mechanism for\nobjects above and below this range. We present a model for the substellar\ncompanion mass function (CMF). It consists of the superposition of the planet\nand BD companion mass distributions, assuming that we can extrapolate the RV\nmeasured companion mass function for planets to larger separations and the\nstellar companion mass-ratio distribution over all separations into the BD mass\nregime. By using both the results of the VLT/NaCo large program and the\ncomplementary archive datasets that probe the occurrence of planets and BDs on\nwide orbits around solar-type stars, we place some constraints on the planet\nand BD distributions. We developed a MC simulation tool to predict the outcome\nof a given survey, depending on the shape of the orbital parameter\ndistributions. Comparing the predictions with the results of the observations,\nwe calculate how likely different models are and which can be ruled out.\nCurrent observations are consistent with the proposed model for the CMF, as\nlong as a sufficiently small outer truncation radius is introduced for the\nplanet separation distribution. The results of the direct imaging surveys\nsearching for substellar companions around Sun-like stars are consistent with a\ncombined substellar mass spectrum of planets and BDs. This mass distribution\nhas a minimum between 10 and 50 MJup, in agreement with RV measurements. The\ndearth of objects in this mass range would naturally arise from the shape of\nthe mass distribution, without the introduction of any distinct formation\nmechanism for BDs.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures.

A distinctive property of the nebular\ncomponent in these ETGs, classified i+, is a two-radial-zone structure, with\nthe inner zone displaying LINER emission with a H\\alpha equivalent width\nEW~1{\\AA}, and the outer one (3{\\AA}<EW<~20{\\AA}) showing HII-region\ncharacteristics. Using CALIFA IFS data, we empirically demonstrate that the\nconfinement of nebular emission to the galaxy periphery leads to a strong\naperture (or, redshift) bias in spectroscopic single-fiber studies of type i+\nETGs: At low redshift (<~0.45), SDSS spectroscopy is restricted to the inner\n(SF-devoid LINER) zone, thereby leading to their erroneous classification as\n\"retired\" galaxies (systems lacking SF and whose faint emission is powered by\npAGB stars). Only at higher z's the SDSS aperture can encompass the outer SF\nzone, permitting their unbiased classification as \"composite SF/LINER\". We also\ndemonstrate that the principal effect of a decreasing aperture on the\nclassification of i+ ETGs via standard BPT emission-line ratios consists in a\nmonotonic up-right shift precisely along the upper-right wing of the \"seagull\"\ndistribution. Motivated by these insights, we also investigate theoretically\nthese biases in aperture-limited studies of inside-out growing galaxies as a\nfunction of z. To this end, we devise a simple model, which involves an\noutwardly propagating SF process, that reproduces the radial extent and\ntwo-zone EW distribution of i+ ETGs.

When the buyer's valuation\nfunction is additive, we are able to completely characterize the different\npossible pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) and in particular obtain a necessary and\nsufficient condition for uniqueness. Furthermore, we characterize the market\nclearing (or Walresian) equilibria for all submodular valuations.\n  Surprisingly, for certain monotone submodular function valuations, we show\nthat the pure NE can exhibit some counterintuitive phenomena; namely, there is\na valuation such that the pricing will be market clearing and within budget if\nthe buyer does not reveal the budget but will result in a smaller set of\nallocated items (and higher prices for items) if the buyer does reveal the\nbudget. It is also the case that the conditions that guarantee market clearing\nin Babaioff et al for submodular functions are not necessarily market clearing\nwhen there is a budget.

For\nthis purpose, the VLT/SPHERE instrument includes a unique long-slit\nspectroscopy (LSS) mode coupled with Lyot coronagraphy in its infrared\ndual-band imager and spectrograph (IRDIS). The performance of this mode is\nintrinsically limited by the use of a non-optimal coronagraph, but in a\nprevious work we demonstrated that it could be significantly improved at small\ninner-working angles using the stop-less Lyot coronagraph (SLLC).

The\nperformance of the SLLC is tested in both imaging and spectroscopy using data\nacquired on the internal source. In imaging, we obtain a raw contrast gain of a\nfactor 10 at 0.3\" and 5 at 0.5\" with the SLLC. Using data acquired with a\nfocal-plane mask, we also demonstrate that no Lyot stop is required to reach\nthe full performance, which validates the SLLC concept. Comparison with a\nrealistic simulation model shows that we are currently limited by the internal\nphase aberrations of SPHERE. In spectroscopy, we obtain a gain of ~1 mag in a\nlimited range of angular separations. Simulations show that although the main\nlimitation comes from phase errors, the performance in the non-SLLC case is\nvery close to the ultimate limit of the LSS mode.

The new learning method preserves the privacy on numerical attributes,\nbuilds a classification model without sharing private data without disclosing\nthe data of each party to others.\n","Comment: 22nd International Conference, ICONIP 2015"]}]

While classical machine\nlearning methods such as the Support Vector Machine and linear Distance\nWeighted Discrimination can sometimes give reasonable answers for a given data\nset, their generalizability is severely compromised because of the linear\nseparating boundary. Radial DWD addresses this challenge by using a more\nappropriate (in this particular case) spherical separating boundary.\nSimulations show that for appropriate radial contexts, this gives much better\ngeneralizability than linear methods, and also much better than conventional\nkernel based (nonlinear) Support Vector Machines, because the latter methods\nessentially use much of the information in the data for determining the shape\nof the separating boundary.

This subspace information can be used directly, in order to\nseparate users in the spatial domain, or indirectly, in order to improve the\nestimate of the user channel vector from the current pilot-symbol observation.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures.

While the mechanisms of worm infection and their\npropagation models are well understood, defense against worms remains an open\nproblem. One branch of defense research investigates the behavioral difference\nbetween worm-infected hosts and normal hosts to set them apart. One particular\nobservation is that a worm-infected host, which scans the Internet with\nrandomly selected addresses, has a much higher connection-failure rate than a\nnormal host.
