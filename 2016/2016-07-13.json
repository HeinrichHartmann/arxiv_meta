There are three degenerate physical\nsolutions and two of these are due to a new type of degeneracy in the\nmicrolensing parallax parameters, which we designate \"the wide degeneracy\".

At the same time, they are\nknown to be very sensitive to photon losses and rather hard to produce\nexperimentally. Concerning the former, here we present a scheme where NOON\nstates are the elementary resources for building quantum error correction codes\nagainst photon losses, thus demonstrating that such resources can also be\nuseful to suppress the effect of loss. Our NOON-code is an exact code that can\nbe systematically extended from one-photon to higher-number losses.

Another\ngeneralisation of the NOON-code is given for arbitrary logical qudits instead\nof logical qubits. While, in general, the final codewords are always obtainable\nfrom multi-mode NOON states through application of beam splitters, both\ncodewords for the one-photon-loss qubit NOON-code can be simply created from\nsingle-photon states with beam splitters.

This\nstrategy may not only lead to deep understanding of the quantum phase itself,\nbut also its deep connections to various other quantum phases nearby. We\nimplement this approach by studying the Rotated Ferromagnetic Heisenberg model\n(RFHM) in two different transverse fields $h_x$ and $h_z$ which can be\nintuitively visualized as studying spin-orbit couplings (SOC) effects in 2d\nIsing or anisotropic XY model in a transverse field. At a special SOC class, it\nwas known that the RFHM at a zero field owns an exact ground state called Y-x\nstate. It supports non only the commensurate C-C$_0$ and C-C$_{\\pi} $ magnons,\nbut also the in-commensurate C-IC magnons. These magnons are non-relativistic,\nnot contained in the exact ground state, so need to be thermally excited.

It can also be an indication of a\nnew force that couples to muons, but not to electrons. An effective field\ntheory analysis using Non Relativistic Quantum Electrodynamics (NRQED)\nindicates that the muonic hydrogen result can be interpreted as a large,\ncompared to some model estimates, muon-proton spin-independent contact\ninteraction. The muonic hydrogen result can be tested by a muon-proton\nscattering experiment, MUSE, that is planned at the Paul Scherrer Institute in\nSwitzerland. The typical momenta of the muons in this experiment are of the\norder of the muon mass. In this energy regime the muons are relativistic but\nthe protons are still non-relativistic. The interaction between the muons and\nprotons can be described by a hybrid QED-NRQED effective field theory. We\npresent some elements of this effective field theory. In particular we consider\n${\\cal O}(Z\\alpha)$ scattering up to power $m^2/M^2$, where $m$ ($M$) is the\nmuon (proton) mass and $Z=1$ for a proton, and ${\\cal O}(Z^2\\alpha^2)$\nscattering at leading power.

The first scenario is that the\nregolith in Gale Crater adsorbs methane when dry and releases this methane to\nthe atmosphere upon deliquescence. The adsorption energy needs to be 36 kJ/mol\nto explain the magnitude of the methane spikes, higher than existing laboratory\nmeasurements. The second scenario is that microorganisms convert organic matter\nin the soil to methane when they are in liquid solutions. This scenario does\nnot require regolith adsorption, but entails extant life on Mars. The third\nscenario is that deep subsurface aquifers produce the bursts of methane.\nContinued in situ measurements of methane and water, as well as laboratory\nstudies of adsorption and deliquescence, will test these hypotheses and inform\nthe existence of the near-surface reservoir and its exchange with the\natmosphere.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication on Astrobiology"]}]

Most of these\ncarbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars also show enhancement in elements\nproduced mainly by the s-process (CEMP-s stars) and evidence suggests that the\norigin of these non-standard abundances can be traced to mass transfer from a\nbinary asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion. Thus, observations of CEMP-s\nstars are commonly used to infer the nucleosynthesis output of low-metallicity\nAGB stars. A crucial step in this exercise is understanding what happens to the\naccreted material after mass transfer ceases. Here we present models of the\npost-mass-transfer evolution of CEMP-s stars considering the physics of\nthermohaline mixing and atomic diffusion, including radiative levitation. We\nfind that stars with typical CEMP-s star masses (M ~ 0.85 Msun) have very\nshallow convective envelopes (Menv < 1e-7 Msun). Hence, the surface abundance\nvariations arising from the competition between gravitational settling and\nradiative levitation should be orders of magnitude larger than observed (e.g.\n[C/Fe]<-1 or [C/Fe]>+4). We are therefore unable to reproduce the spread in the\nobserved abundances with these models and conclude that some other physical\nprocess must largely suppress atomic diffusion in the outer layers of CEMP-s\nstars. We demonstrate that this could be achieved by some additional\n(turbulent) mixing process operating at the base of the convective envelope, as\nfound by other authors. Alternatively, mass-loss rates around 1e-13 Msun/yr\ncould also negate most of the abundance variations by eroding the surface\nlayers and forcing the base of the convective envelope to move inwards in mass.\nSince atomic diffusion cannot have a substantial effect on the surface\nabundances of CEMP-s stars, the dilution of the accreted material, while\nvariable in degree from one star to the next, is most likely the same for all\nelements.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 8 figures.

In this context, there is more cold gas, fueling the central\noptical AGN, in isolated systems.

The waves are probably driven by\nphotospheric motions and may transport energy up to prominences suspended in\nthe corona. Dissipation of wave energy can lead to heating of the cool\nprominence plasma, so contributing to the local energy balance within the\nprominence. Here we discuss the role of Alfv\\'en wave dissipation as a heating\nmechanism for the prominence plasma. We consider a slab-like quiescent\nprominence model with a transverse magnetic field embedded in the solar corona.\nThe prominence medium is modelled as a partially ionized plasma composed of a\ncharged ion-electron single fluid and two separate neutral fluids corresponding\nto neutral hydrogen and neutral helium. Friction between the three fluids acts\nas a dissipative mechanism for the waves. The heating caused by\nexternally-driven Alfv\\'en waves incident on the prominence slab is\nanalytically explored. We find that the dense prominence slab acts as a\nresonant cavity for the waves. The fraction of incident wave energy that is\nchannelled into the slab strongly depends upon the wave period, $P$. Using\ntypical prominence conditions, we obtain that wave energy trapping and\nassociated heating are negligible when $P \\gtrsim 100$ s, so that it is\nunlikely that those waves have a relevant influence on prominence energetics.\nWhen $1$ s $\\lesssim P \\lesssim 100$ s the energy absorption into the slab\nshows several sharp and narrow peaks, that can reach up to 100%, when the\nincident wave frequency matches a cavity resonance of the slab. Wave heating is\nenhanced at those resonant frequencies. Conversely, when $P \\lesssim 1$ s\ncavity resonances are absent, but the waves are heavily damped by the strong\ndissipation.

Based on\nformation enthalpies from optimized van der Waals density functional\ncalculations, three thermodynamically stable phases (Li$_4$C$_3$, Li$_2$C$_2$\nand LiC$_{12}$) were identified at 0 GPa, and seven thermodynamically stable\nphases (Li$_8$C, Li$_6$C, Li$_4$C, Li$_8$C$_3$, Li$_2$C, Li$_3$C$_4$, and\nLi$_2$C$_3$) were predicted at 40 GPa. A rich diversity of carbon bonding,\nincluding monomers, dimers, trimers, nanoribbons, sheets and frameworks, was\nfound within these structures, and the dimensionality of carbon connectivity\nexisting within each phase was observed to increase with increasing carbon\nconcentration. Of particular interest, we find that the well-known composition\nLiC$_6$ is actually a metastable one. We also find a unique coexistence of\ncarbon monomers and dimers within the predicted thermodynamically stable phase\nLi$_8$C$_3$, and different widths of carbon nanoribbons coexist in a metastable\nphase of Li$_2$C$_2$ (\\textit{Imm}2). Interesting mixed\n\\textit{sp}$^2$-\\textit{sp}$^3$ carbon frameworks are predicted in metastable\nphases with composition LiC$_6$.\n"]}]

There have been a number of\napproximate MCMC algorithms that use sub-sampling ideas to reduce this\ncomputational burden, but with the drawback that these algorithms no longer\ntarget the true posterior distribution. We introduce a new family of Monte\nCarlo methods based upon a multi-dimensional version of the Zig-Zag process of\n(Bierkens, Roberts, 2016), a continuous time piecewise deterministic Markov\nprocess. While traditional MCMC methods are reversible by construction the\nZig-Zag process offers a flexible non-reversible alternative. The dynamics of\nthe Zig-Zag process correspond to a constant velocity model, with the velocity\nof the process switching at events from a point process. The rate of this point\nprocess can be related to the invariant distribution of the process. If we wish\nto target a given posterior distribution, then rates need to be set equal to\nthe gradient of the log of the posterior. Unlike traditional MCMC, We show how\nthe Zig-Zag process can be simulated without discretisation error, and give\nconditions for the process to be ergodic. Most importantly, we introduce a\nsub-sampling version of the Zig-Zag process that is an example of an exact\napproximate scheme. That is, if we replace the true gradient of the log\nposterior with an unbiased estimator, obtained by sub-sampling, then the\nresulting approximate process still has the posterior as its stationary\ndistribution. Furthermore, if we use a control-variate idea to reduce the\nvariance of our unbiased estimator, then both heuristic arguments and empirical\nobservations show that Zig-Zag can be super-efficient: after an initial\npre-processing step, essentially independent samples from the posterior\ndistribution are obtained at a computational cost which does not depend on the\nsize of the data.\n"]}]

The TILT can be\ndetermined from the gray level, the unknown is the SLANT. To calculate the\nnormal of each part of the surface (pixel) a supervised Machine learning method\nhas been proposed. This method divided into three steps: the first step is the\npreparation of the training data from 3D mathematical functions and synthetic\nobjects. The second step is the creation of database of examples from 3D\nobjects (off-line process). The third step is the application of test images\n(on-line process). The idea is to find for each pixel of the test image the\nmost similar element in the examples database using a similarity value.\n","Comment: 2nd International Conference on Signal, Image, Vision and their\n  Applications (SIVA'13), November 18-20, 2013 - Guelma, Algeria"]}]

During the last\ndecade, machine learning has made spectacular progress, surpassing human\nperformance in complex tasks such as object recognition, car driving, and\ncomputer gaming. However, the central role of prediction in machine learning\navoids progress towards general-purpose artificial intelligence. As one way\nforward, we argue that causal inference is a fundamental component of human\nintelligence, yet ignored by learning algorithms.\n  Causal inference is the problem of uncovering the cause-effect relationships\nbetween the variables of a data generating system. Causal structures provide\nunderstanding about how these systems behave under changing, unseen\nenvironments. In turn, knowledge about these causal dynamics allows to answer\n\"what if\" questions, describing the potential responses of the system under\nhypothetical manipulations and interventions. Thus, understanding cause and\neffect is one step from machine learning towards machine reasoning and machine\nintelligence. But, currently available causal inference algorithms operate in\nspecific regimes, and rely on assumptions that are difficult to verify in\npractice.\n  This thesis advances the art of causal inference in three different ways.\nFirst, we develop a framework for the study of statistical dependence based on\ncopulas and random features.

To\novercome this difficulty, we take on a new approach that combines a\nparameterized 3D magnetic field model with forward modeling of the polarization\nsignal. For that purpose, we develop a new, fast and efficient, optimization\nmethod for model-data fitting: the Radial-basis-functions Optimization\nApproximation Method (ROAM). Model-data fitting is achieved by optimizing a\nuser-specified log-likelihood function that quantifies the differences between\nthe observed polarization signal and its synthetic/predicted analogue. Speed\nand efficiency are obtained by combining sparse evaluation of the magnetic\nmodel with radial-basis-function (RBF) decomposition of the log-likelihood\nfunction. The RBF decomposition provides an analytical expression for the\nlog-likelihood function that is used to inexpensively estimate the set of\nparameter values optimizing it. We test and validate ROAM on a synthetic test\nbed of a coronal magnetic flux rope and show that it performs well with a\nsignificantly sparse sample of the parameter space. We conclude that our\noptimization method is well-suited for fast and efficient model-data fitting\nand can be exploited for converting coronal polarimetric measurements, such as\nthe ones provided by CoMP, into coronal magnetic field data.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 12 figures, accepted in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space\n  Sciences"]}]

Many algorithms for the reconstruction of molecules from images\nin heterogeneous Cryo-EM experiments are based on iterative approximations of\nthe molecules in a non-convex optimization that is prone to reaching suboptimal\nlocal minima.
