We\nfind that an USEC holds provided the density dependence of the symmetry energy\n$E_s(n)$ follows a behaviour that limits the proton fraction $x(n)$ to values\nbelow the threshold for the direct Urca (DU) cooling process. The absence of DU\ncooling in typical mass neutron stars appears to be supported by the\nphenomenology of neutron star cooling data and allows to constrain the\nbehaviour of $E_s(n)$ at high densities. Two classes of symmetry energy\nfunctions are investigated more in detail to elucidate the USEC. We derive an\nanalytic formula for the USEC to the neutron star EoS based on the result for\nthe symmetry energy extracted from isobaric analog states of nuclei.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 12 figures, one figure (Fig. 6) and descriptive text added"]}]

The system must react\nto unplanned events in order to optimize the task allocation between the\nrobots. In a broad sense, the resilience of a system can be defined as the\nability to maintain or recover a stable state when subject to disturbance and\nit is related to the concept of robustness in industrial systems. In this\npaper, we study the resilience in a synchronized multi-robot system stated as\nfollows:Consider a team of $n$ (ground or aerial) robots each moving along\npredetermined periodic closed trajectories. Each of the agents needs to\ncommunicate informationabout its operation to other agents, but the\ncommunication links have a limited range. Hence, when two agents are within\ncommunication range, a communication link is established, and information is\nexchanged. Thus, two neighbors are synchronized if they visit the communication\nlink at the same time and a multi-robot system is called synchronized if each\npair of neighbors is synchronized. If a set of robots left the system, then\nsome trajectories has no robots. In these cases, when an alive robot detects no\nneighboring robot then it pass to this neighboring trajectory to assume the\nunattended task. In this framework, a fault-tolerance measure is introduced:\nthe resilience of the system is the largest number of robots that can fail\nwhile executing the global task. Interesting combinatorial properties of the\nresilience are showed that allow to know its value for some usual scenarios.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures"]}]
