The main theme of our paper\nis to identify several of these problems, among them a couple of widely studied\nextremal functions related to certain restricted versions of the k-SAT problem,\nwhere the Local Lemma does give essentially optimal answers.\n  As our main contribution, we construct unsatisfiable k-CNF formulas where\nevery clause has k distinct literals and every variable appears in at most (2/e\n+ o(1))*2^k/k clauses. The Lopsided Local Lemma shows that this is\nasymptotically best possible. The determination of this extremal function is\nparticularly important as it represents the value where the corresponding k-SAT\nproblem exhibits a complexity hardness jump: from having every instance being a\nYES-instance it becomes NP-hard just by allowing each variable to occur in one\nmore clause.\n  The construction of our unsatisfiable CNF-formulas is based on the binary\ntree approach of [16] and thus the constructed formulas are in the class MU(1)\nof minimal unsatisfiable formulas having one more clauses than variables. The\nmain novelty of our approach here comes in setting up an appropriate continuous\napproximation of the problem. This leads us to a differential equation, the\nsolution of which we are able to estimate. The asymptotically optimal binary\ntrees are then obtained through a discretization of this solution.\n  The importance of the binary trees constructed is also underlined by their\nappearance in many other scenarios. In particular, they give asymptotically\nprecise answers for seemingly unrelated problems like the European Tenure Game\nintroduced by Doerr [9] and a search problem allowing a limited number of\nconsecutive lies.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The potential for photonic devices to directly manipulate\nlight remains unfulfilled due largely to a lack of materials with strong, fast\noptical nonlinearities. In this paper, we show that small-signal amplifier,\nsummator and invertor functions for optical signals may be realized using a\nfour-port device that exploits the coherent interaction of beams on a planar\nplasmonic metamaterial, assuming no intrinsic nonlinearity. The redistribution\nof energy among ports can be coherently controlled at the single photon level,\nwith THz bandwidth and without introducing signal distortion, thereby\npresenting powerful opportunities for novel optical data processing\narchitectures, complexity oracles and the locally coherent networks that are\nbecoming part of the mainstream telecommunications agenda.\n"]}]

These effects play an\nimportant role for the numerical determination of large deviation functions of\nadditive observables for stochastic processes. A method commonly used in order\nto determine such functions is the so-called cloning algorithm which in its\nnon-constant population version essentially reduces to the determination of the\ngrowth rate of a population, averaged over many realizations of the dynamics.\nHowever, the averaging of populations is highly dependent not only on the\nnumber of realizations of the population dynamics, and on the initial\npopulation size but also on the cut-off time (or population) considered to stop\ntheir numerical evolution. This may result in an over-influence of discreteness\neffects at initial times, caused by small population size. We overcome these\neffects by introducing a (realization-dependent) time delay in the evolution of\npopulations, additional to the discarding of the initial transient regime of\nthe population growth where these discreteness effects are strong.

Here we, for the first time, establish a rigorous classification\nof topological metals that are protected by the PT symmetry using KO-theory. As\na physically realistic example, a PT-invariant nodal loop (NL) model in a 3D\nBrillouin zone is constructed, whose topological stability is revealed through\nits PT-symmetry-protected nontrivial Z2 topological charge. Based on these\nexact results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize and to detect\ntunable PT-invariant topological NL states with ultracold atoms in an optical\nlattice, in which atoms with two hyperfine spin states are loaded in a\nspin-dependent 3D OL and two pairs of Raman lasers are used to create\nout-of-plane spin-flip hopping with site-dependent phase. Such a realistic\ncold-atom setup can yield topological NL states, having a tunable ring-shaped\nband-touching line with the two-fold degeneracy in the bulk spectrum and\nnon-trivial surface states. The states are actually protected by the combined\nPT symmetry even in the absence of both P and T symmetries, and are\ncharacterized by a Z2-type invariant (a quantized Berry phase). Remarkably, we\ndemonstrate with numerical simulations that (i) the characteristic NL can be\ndetected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener\noscillation; (ii) the topological invariant may be measured based on the\ntime-of-flight imaging; and (iii) the surface states may be probed through\nBragg spectroscopy.

Hence, this\nwork also presents an explicit locally convex topology on the universal\nenveloping algebra of certain locally convex Lie algebras.
