One approach to understanding the emergence of this\nresponse is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory\ndata with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is\nbelieved that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across\nneurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively\nsmall number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of\nsparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been\nproposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the\nspecific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still\nlargely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural\nrepresentation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism\nthat optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding\nalgorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from\nnatural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms.\nResults show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding\nresults, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of\nnatural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding\nis optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical\ncompetition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more\nefficient solution to the emergence of independent components.\n"]}]

Nonlinearity, however,\nraises fundamental issues because regressors are no longer ancillary, hence\ncan't be treated as fixed. The consequences are severe: (1)~the regressor\ndistribution affects the slope parameters, and (2)~randomness of the regressors\nconspires with the nonlinearity to create sampling variability in slope\nestimates --- even in the complete absence of error. For these observations to\nmake sense it is necessary to re-interpret population slopes and view them not\nas parameters in a generative model but as statistical functionals associated\nwith OLS fitting as it applies to largely arbitrary joint $\\xy$~distributions.\nIn such a \"model-robust\" approach to linear regression, the meaning of slope\nparameters needs to be rethought and inference needs to be based on\nmodel-robust standard errors that can be estimated with sandwich plug-in\nestimators or with the $\\xy$~bootstrap.

When this ratio,\nwhich depends on the bandwidth of the excitation signal, exceeds a certain\nvalue, the Markovian approach is appropriate; below, memory of preceding\nexcitations arises, leading to a significant decrease of the jump duration; at\nthe smallest values of the ratio, chattering occurs. Overall, our results open\nthe way for uses of the model in the low excitation regime, which is still\npoorly understood.\n","Comment: Final published version, 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We also prove that for any infinite,\nfinitely-generated group with more than one end, there exists a locally finite\nCayley graph on which SAWs have positive speed - this implies that the mean\nsquare displacement exponent $\\nu=1$ on such graphs.\n  These results are obtained by proving more general theorems for SAWs on\nquasi-transitive graphs with more than one end, which make use of a variation\nof Kesten's pattern theorem in a surprising way, as well as the Stalling's\nsplitting theorem. Applications include proving that SAWs have positive speed\non the square grid in an infinite cylinder, and on the infinite free product\ngraph of two connected, quasi-transitive graphs.\n"]}]

But what\nmakes two images similar? Most existing work on visual similarity assumes that\nimages are similar because they contain the same object instance or category.\nHowever, the reason why images are similar is much more complex. For example,\nfrom the perspective of category, a black dog image is similar to a white dog\nimage. However, in terms of color, a black dog image is more similar to a black\nhorse image than the white dog image. This example serves to illustrate that\nvisual similarity is ambiguous but can be made precise when given an explicit\ncontextual perspective. Based on this observation, we propose the concept of\ncontextual visual similarity. To be concrete, we examine the concept of\ncontextual visual similarity in the application domain of image search. Instead\nof providing only a single image for image similarity search (\\eg, Google image\nsearch), we require three images. Given a query image, a second positive image\nand a third negative image, dissimilar to the first two images, we define a\ncontextualized similarity search criteria. In particular, we learn feature\nweights over all the feature dimensions of each image such that the distance\nbetween the query image and the positive image is small and their distances to\nthe negative image are large after reweighting their features. The learned\nfeature weights encode the contextualized visual similarity specified by the\nuser and can be used for attribute specific image search. We also show the\nusefulness of our contextualized similarity weighting scheme for different\ntasks, such as answering visual analogy questions and unsupervised attribute\ndiscovery.\n","Comment: Submitted to CVPR 2017"]}]

From the light\ncurve amplitude data we are able to determine the orientation of the rotation\naxis of Bienor ($\\beta_p=50\\pm3^{\\circ}$, $\\lambda_p=35\\pm8^{\\circ}$). We are\nalso able to constrain the $b/a$ axial ratio of a triaxial Jacobi ellipsoidal\nbody (with semi-axis $a>b>c$). The best fit is for $b/a=0.45\\pm0.05$, which\ncorresponds to a density value of $594^{+47}_{-35}$ kg$\\,$m$^{-3}$ under the\nusual assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium and given that Bienor's rotational\nperiod is 9.17 h. However, the absolute magnitude of Bienor at several epochs\nis not well reproduced. We tested several explanations such as relaxing the\nhydrostatic equilibrium constraint, a large North-South asymmetry in the\nsurface albedo of Bienor or even a ring system. When a ring system of similar\ncharacteristics to those of Chariklo and Chiron is included, we can fit both\nthe light curve amplitude and absolute magnitude. In this case the derived\naxial ratio is modified to $b/a=0.37\\pm0.10$. The implied density is\n$678^{+209}_{-100}$ kg$\\,$m$^{-3}$. Also the existence of a ring is consistent\nwith the spectroscopic detection of water ice on Bienor. Nevertheless the other\nexplanations cannot be discarded.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, 13 tables, accepted in MNRAS"]}]

There are many factors that can make of group exercises a\nchallenging setting for older adults. A major one in the elderly population is\nthe difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical,\npsychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a novel virtual gym that enables\nonline group-exercises in older adults with different levels of skills.\n  Methods. A total of 37 older adults (65-87 years old) followed a personalized\nexercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period\nof eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a\ntablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to a Control group\n(individual training) or Social group (online group-exercising). Pre- and post-\nmeasurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social\nwellbeing outcomes. The study received ethical approval from the CREATE-NET\nEthics Committee on ICT Research Involving Human Beings (Application N.\n2014-001).\n  Results. There were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in\nterms of physical outcomes. Interestingly though, while in the Control group\nfitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case\nfor the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For\npsychological and social wellbeing outcomes there were improvements on both\ngroups, regardless of the application used.\n  Conclusion. Group exercising in a virtual gym can be effective in motivating\nand enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter\nindividuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together\ndespite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise\ncan reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context.

The design of the supervisor consists of two parts: safety\nverification and control design. Safety verification is the problem to\ndetermine if vehicles will be able to cross the intersection without colliding\nwith current drivers' inputs. We translate this safety verification problem\ninto a jobshop scheduling problem, which minimizes the maximum lateness and\nevaluates if the optimal cost is zero. The zero optimal cost corresponds to the\ncase in which all vehicles can cross each conflict area without collisions.\nComputing the optimal cost requires solving a Mixed Integer Nonlinear\nProgramming (MINLP) problem due to the nonlinear second-order dynamics of the\nvehicles. We therefore estimate this optimal cost by formulating two related\nMixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems that assume simpler vehicle\ndynamics. We prove that these two MILP problems yield lower and upper bounds of\nthe optimal cost. We also quantify the worst case approximation errors of these\nMILP problems. We design the supervisor to override the vehicles with a safe\ncontrol input if the MILP problem that computes the upper bound yields a\npositive optimal cost.
