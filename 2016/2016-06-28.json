This paper introduces the asymptotic concept of high\ndimensional efficiency which quantifies the detection power of different\nstatistics in such situations. While being related to classic asymptotic\nrelative efficiency, it is different in that it provides the rate at which the\nchange can get smaller with dimension while still being detectable. This also\nallows for comparisons of different methods with different null asymptotics as\nis for example the case in high-dimensional change point settings. Based on\nthis new concept we investigate change point detection procedures using\nprojections and develop asymptotic theory for how full panel (multivariate)\ntests compare with both oracle and random projections. Furthermore, for each\ngiven projection we can quantify a cone such that the corresponding projection\nstatistic yields better power behavior if the true change direction is within\nthis cone. The effect of misspecification of the covariance on the power of the\ntests is investigated, because in many high dimensional situations estimation\nof the full dependency (covariance) between the multivariate observations in\nthe panel is often either computationally or even theoretically infeasible. It\nturns out that the projection statistic is much more robust in this respect in\nterms of size and somewhat more robust in terms of power. The theoretic\nquantification by the theory is accompanied by simulation results which confirm\nthe theoretic (asymptotic) findings for surprisingly small samples.

This formulation differs from the Elastic Net (EN) formulation,\nin which the regularizer is a convex combination of the $\\ell_1$- and\n$\\ell_2$-norm squared. This seemingly simple modification has fairly\nsignificant consequences. In particular, it is shown in this paper that the EN\nformulation \\textit{does not achieve} robust recovery of sparse vectors in the\ncontext of compressed sensing, whereas the new CLOT formulation does so. Also,\nlike EN but unlike LASSO, the CLOT formulation achieves the grouping effect,\nwherein coefficients of highly correlated columns of the measurement (or\ndesign) matrix are assigned roughly comparable values. It is noteworthy that\nLASSO does not have the grouping effect and EN (as shown here) does not achieve\nrobust sparse recovery. Therefore the CLOT formulation combines the best\nfeatures of both LASSO (robust sparse recovery) and EN (grouping effect).\n  The CLOT formulation is a special case of another one called SGL (Sparse\nGroup LASSO) which was introduced into the literature previously, but without\nany analysis of either the grouping effect or robust sparse recovery.

The path algorithm is attractive because it provides\nthe entire family of estimates for all possible values of the condition number\nbound, at the same computational cost of a single estimate with a fixed upper\nbound. An important finding is that the proximal operator for the condition\nnumber constraint, which turns out to be very useful in regularizing loss\nfunctions that are not orthogonally invariant and may yield\nnon-positive-definite estimates, can be efficiently computed by this path\nalgorithm.

These tracts linked hippocampus to septum, and amygdala to BNST.\nSeptal and BNST axons passed by anteromedial thalamic nucleus to MHb, which\nprojected to pineal gland. Question is what is the MHb doing and why it\nreceives information from hippocampus via septum? This study explores the MHb\nconnectivity, predicts its functional role and how it is linked to memory.\nCombination of known findings about the septum and MHb connectivity and\nfunction led to this circuit-based idea that posterior septum activates MHb,\nMHb activates IPN,and IPN stimulates MRN and its serotonin release. Proposed\nidea is that this MHb-IPN-MRN circuit promotes slow wave sleep (SWS), high\nserotonin and low acetylcholine state. My prediction is that this SWS-promoting\ncircuit reciprocally suppresses the theta oscillations promoting circuit,\nlinked to high acetylcholine levels in brain, and formed by supramamillary area\nprojections to the medial septum (MS) that induces theta rhythm in hippocampus\nand other theta-coupled regions.

In these limits, resonances\nmay be included as elementary weakly coupled spin-zero states or can correspond\nto hyperglueballs, hyperonia, or pseudoscalar hypermesons. For each of these\ncases, we make predictions for additional states that could be resonantly or\npair produced and observed at the Large Hadron Collider or in future collider\nexperiments. Heavy digauge boson resonances can provide a unified explanation\nfor a number of small discrepancies and excesses in reported data from the\nLarge Hadron Collider.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 4 figures. v2: Title changed, additional minor\n  modifications in the text (conclusions unchanged), references added. v3:\n  Minor modifications (conclusions unchanged), matches published version"]}]

Our main\nresult is that $D_\\beta$ is nonempty if and only if the number $1$ has a unique\nnonterminating expansion in base $\\beta$, and in that case, $D_\\beta$ is\nuncountable. We give a sufficient condition for $D_\\beta$ to have positive\nHausdorff dimension, and show that, on the other hand, there are infinitely\nmany values of $\\beta$ for which $D_\\beta$ is uncountable but of Hausdorff\ndimension zero.\n","Comment: 25 pages.

Recent studies show\nthat YAP/TAZ mechanical sensing is dependent on RhoA-regulated stress fibers.\nHowever, current understanding of YAP/TAZ still remains limited due to the\nunknown interaction between the canonical Hippo pathway and cell tension. To\nidentify the roles of key signaling molecules in mechanical signal sensing and\ntransduction, we present a novel computational model of the YAP/TAZ signaling\npathway. This model converts ECM mechanical properties to biochemical signals\nvia adhesion, and integrates intracellular signaling cascades associated with\ncytoskeleton dynamics. Adhesion molecules, such as FAK, are predicted to rescue\nYAP/TAZ activity in soft environments via the RhoA pathway. We found that\nchanges of molecule concentrations result in different pattern of YAP/TAZ\nstiffness response. We also investigate the sensitivity of YAP/TAZ activity to\nECM stiffness. In addition, the model shows that the unresolved synergistic\neffect of YAP/TAZ activity between the mechanosensing and the Hippo pathways\ncan be explained by the interaction of LIMK and LATS. Overall, our model\nprovides a novel platform for studying YAP/TAZ activity in the context of\nintegrating different signaling pathways.

Moreover, $\\mathcal{G}$ can be\nenhanced to support efficient update operations: After processing $\\mathcal{G}$\nin $O(w f_{\\mathcal{A}})$ time, we can insert/delete any (sub)string of length\n$y$ into/from an arbitrary position of $T$ in $O((y+ \\log N\\log^* M)\nf_{\\mathcal{A}})$ time, where $f_{\\mathcal{A}} = O(\\min \\{ \\frac{\\log\\log M\n\\log\\log w}{\\log\\log\\log M}, \\sqrt{\\frac{\\log w}{\\log\\log w}} \\})$.

In addition, only a few investigations\nhave probed the suitability of representations based on bipartite networks and\ngraphs (bigraphs) for the problem, as many approaches consider all possible\nlinks between words. In this context, we assess the relevance of a bipartite\nnetwork model representing both feature words (i.e. the words characterizing\nthe context) and target (ambiguous) words to solve ambiguities in written\ntexts. Here, we focus on the semantical relationships between these two type of\nwords, disregarding the relationships between feature words. In special, the\nproposed method not only serves to represent texts as graphs, but also\nconstructs a structure on which the discrimination of senses is accomplished.\nOur results revealed that the proposed learning algorithm in such bipartite\nnetworks provides excellent results mostly when topical features are employed\nto characterize the context. Surprisingly, our method even outperformed the\nsupport vector machine algorithm in particular cases, with the advantage of\nbeing robust even if a small training dataset is available. Taken together, the\nresults obtained here show that the proposed representation/classification\nmethod might be useful to improve the semantical characterization of written\ntexts.\n"]}]

The first to consider these problems over a general ordered\nalphabet was Kosolobov (\\emph{Inf.\\ Process.\\ Lett.}, 2016), who presented an\n$O(n (\\log n)^{2/3})$-time algorithm for answering $O(n)$ LCE queries. This\nresult was improved by Gawrychowski et.\\ al.\\ (accepted to CPM 2016) to $O(n\n\\log \\log n)$ time. In this work we note a special \\emph{non-crossing} property\nof LCE queries asked in the runs computation. We show that any $n$ such\nnon-crossing queries can be answered on-line in $O(n \\alpha(n))$ time, which\nyields an $O(n \\alpha(n))$-time algorithm for computing runs.\n"]}]

We use a motivational example from the North American\nCystic Fibrosis (CF) Consortium genetic association study with 3444 individuals\nand 898 family members to illustrate the challenge of computing ancestry scores\nwhen sets of both unrelated individuals and closely-related family members are\nincluded. We propose novel methods to obtain ancestry scores and demonstrate\nthat the proposed methods outperform existing methods. The current standard is\nto compute loadings (left singular vectors) using unrelated individuals and to\ncompute projected scores for remaining family members. However, projected\nancestry scores from this approach suffer from shrinkage toward zero. We\nconsider in turn alternate strategies: (i) within-family data\northogonalization, (ii) matrix substitution based on decomposition of a target\nfamily-orthogonalized covariance matrix, (iii) covariance-preserving whitening,\nretaining covariances between unrelated pairs while orthogonalizing family\nmembers, and (iv) using family-averaged data to obtain loadings. Except for\nwithin-family orthogonalization, our proposed approaches offer similar\nperformance and are superior to the standard approaches.

The linearization allows us\nto use Matsubara frequencies instead of real ones. As a result it gives us an\nadvantage in terms of efficiency, allowing us easily switch to the imaginary\ntime representation the same way as in the space time method. The all electron\nLAPW basis set eliminates the need for pseudopotentials.

For each tree, let h:T_j->Z be the Busemann function with respect\nto a fixed boundary point (end). Its level sets are the horocycles.

This group is of type F_{d-1}, but not F_d. It is not\nautomatic, but it is an automata group in most cases.\n  On the other hand, when the q_j do not all coincide, DL(q_1,...,q_d) is a\nvertex-transitive graph, but is not the Cayley graph of a finitely generated\ngroup. Indeed, it does not even admit a group action with finitely many orbits\nand finite point stabilizers.\n  The l^2-spectrum of the ``simple random walk'' operator on DL is always pure\npoint. When d=2, it is known explicitly from previous work, while for d=3 we\ncompute it explicitly. Finally, we determine the Poisson boundary of a large\nclass of group-invariant random walks on DL.
