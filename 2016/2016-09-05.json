Classically, the Riemannian structure\ncomes in two flavors: Wasserstein and Fisher--Rao. The former is pivotal in\noptimal mass transport (OMT), whereas the latter occurs in information\ngeometry---the differential geometric approach to statistics. Both Riemannian\nstructures naturally restrict to the submanifold of multivariate Gaussian\ndistributions, thereby inducing Riemannian structures on the space of\ncovariance matrices.\n  Here we give a systematic description of classical matrix decompositions (or\nfactorizations) in terms of Riemannian geometry and compatible principal bundle\nstructures. Both Wasserstein and Fisher--Rao geometries are discussed. The link\nto matrices is obtained by considering OMT and information geometry in the\ncategory of linear transformations and multivariate Gaussian distributions.\nThis way, OMT is directly related to the polar decomposition of matrices,\nwhereas information geometry is directly related to the $QR$, Cholesky,\nspectral, and singular value decompositions. We also give a coherent\ndescription of gradient flow equations for the various decompositions; most\nflows are illustrated in numerical examples.\n  The paper is a combination of previously known and original results. As a\nsurvey it covers the Riemannian description of OMT and polar decompositions\n(both smooth and linear category), entropy gradient flows, and the Fisher--Rao\nmetric and its geodesics on the statistical manifold of multivariate Gaussian\ndistributions.

In principle, one requires\nthe \\emph{observed information}--the negative Hessian matrix or the second\nderivative of the log-likelihood---to obtain an accurate maximum likelihood\nestimator according to the Newton method. When one uses the \\emph{Fisher\ninformation}, the expect value of the observed information, a simpler algorithm\nthan the Newton method is obtained as the Fisher scoring algorithm. With the\nadvance in high-throughput technologies in the biological sciences,\nrecommendation systems and social networks, the sizes of data sets---and the\ncorresponding statistical models---have suddenly increased by several orders of\nmagnitude. Neither the observed information nor the Fisher information is easy\nto obtained for these big data sets. This paper introduces an information\nsplitting technique to simplify the computation. After splitting the mean of\nthe observed information and the Fisher information, an simpler approximate\nHessian matrix for the log-likelihood can be obtained. This approximated\nHessian matrix can significantly reduce computations, and makes the linear\nmixed model applicable for big data sets. Such a spitting and simpler formulas\nheavily depends on matrix algebra transforms, and applicable to large scale\nbreeding model, genetics wide association analysis.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1605.07646"]}]

The long-range magnetic\norder occurs below 1.6 K and is confirmed by the results of the heat capacity\nand magnetic susceptibility. The observed magnetic ground state is highly\nsensitive to low magnetic fields, suggesting a delicate magnetic state that\nfits no descriptions of the spin-alone S=1 state as well as the spin-orbit\ninteraction (SOI) imposed Jeff = 0 singlet state. This work generates a phase\ndiagram that features a linear dependence of the magnetic order on Sr doping,\nimplying the same mechanism that drives the ground state across the entire\nseries (Ba1-xSrx)2YIrO6. The emergence of the magnetic ground state is\nextraordinary because its occurrence contradicts the highly anticipated Jeff =\n0 singlet ground state in presence of the strong SOI and highlights a wealth of\nnovel quantum states that are not possible without the unusual interplay\nbetween the strong SOI, electron-electron correlations and electron hopping.\n","Comment: 5 figures"]}]

Early models of the biological\naspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a\nfixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have\nbeen proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are\nnot amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they\nneglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues,\nwe developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of\nevolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the\nspatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and\nquiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by\nbone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of\ninteracting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic\nregimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that\nallow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in\nphysiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional\nsimulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison\nbetween spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and\nsuggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of\naccounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the\nprocess of bone remodeling.

The IoT is a collection of\nconnected devices (things) which are constantly recording data from their\nsurroundings using on-board sensors. These devices can record and stream data\nto the cloud at a very high rate, leading to high storage and analysis costs.\nIn order to ameliorate these costs, we can analyse the data as it arrives in a\nstream to learn about the underlying process, perform interpolation and\nsmoothing and make forecasts and predictions.\n  Conventional tools of state space modelling assume data on a fixed regular\ntime grid. However, many sensors change their sampling frequency, sometimes\nadaptively, or get interrupted and re-started out of sync with the previous\nsampling grid, or just generate event data at irregular times. It is therefore\ndesirable to model the system as a partially and irregularly observed Markov\nprocess which evolves in continuous time. Both the process and the observation\nmodel are potentially non-linear. Particle filters therefore represent the\nsimplest approach to online analysis. A functional Scala library of composable\ncontinuous time Markov process models has been developed in order to model the\nwide variety of data captured in the IoT.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 11 figures.
