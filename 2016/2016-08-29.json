The direct\nconsequence of this approach is that an apriori dielectric constant, which\nstill does not have a clear definition, has to be assigned to this polarization\nlayer. Because the Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) and the Sum-Frequency\nGeneration vibrational Spectroscopy (SFG-VS) have been proven as the sensitive\nprobes for interfaces with the submonolayer coverage, the treatment based on\nthe more realistic discrete induced dipole model needs to be developed. Here we\nshow that following the molecular optics theory approach the SHG, as well as\nthe SFG-VS, radiation from the monolayer or submonolayer at an interface can be\nrigorously treated as the radiation from an induced dipole lattice at the\ninterface. In this approach, the introduction of the polarization sheet is no\nlonger necessary. Therefore, the ambiguity of the unaccounted dielectric\nconstant of the polarization layer is no longer an issue. Moreover, the\nanisotropic two dimensional microscopic local field factors can be explicitly\nexpressed with the linear polarizability tensors of the interfacial molecules.\nBased on the planewise dipole sum rule in the molecular monolayer, crucial\nexperimental tests of this microscopic treatment with SHG and SFG-VS are\ndiscussed. Many puzzles in the literature of surface SHG and SFG spectroscopy\nstudies can also be understood or resolved in this framework. This new\ntreatment may provide a solid basis for the quantitative analysis in the\nsurface SHG and SFG studies.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Opt. Soc. Rap. Public. 8, 13044 (2013), presents the diffraction\nintegrals per Zernike term in the form of doubly infinite series. These double\nseries involve, aside from an overall azimuthal factor, the products of Jinc\nfunctions for the radial dependence and structural quantities $c_t$ that depend\non the optical parameters of the optical system (such as NA and refractive\nindices) and the defocus value. The products in the double series have\ncoefficients that are related to Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and that depend on\nthe order of the Jinc function and the index $t$ of the structural quantity, as\nwell as on the azimuthal order and degree of the involved Zernike term. In\naddition, the structural quantities themselves are also given in the form of\ndoubly infinite series.

We fitted the 610 MHz light curve by a model of\nsynchrotron emission from an expanding shell being modified by radiative\ntransfer effects due to local absorbing gas consisting of a uniformly\ndistributed and a clumpy component. Using our model parameters, we find that\nthe emission at 235 MHz peaked around day 35 which is consistent with our GMRT\nobservations. The two main results of our study are: (1) The radio emission at\na given frequency is visible sooner after the outburst in successive outbursts\nof both V745 Scorpii and RS Ophiuchi.

(2) The clumpy\nmaterial, if exists, is close to the white dwarf and can be interpreted as\nbeing due to the material from the hot accretion disk.

This model is\nsufficiently simple and concise to enable designing a closed-loop controller,\ncapable of accurate vertical positioning of a carried object. The near-field\nacoustic levitation phenomenon exploits the compressibility, the nonlinearity\nand the viscosity of the gas trapped between a rapidly oscillating surface and\na freely suspended planar object, to elevate its time averaged pressure above\nthe ambient pressure. By these means, the vertical position of loads weighing\nup to several kilograms can be varied between dozens and hundreds of\nmicrometers. The simplified model developed in this paper is a second order\nordinary differential equation where the height-dependent stiffness and damping\nterms of the gas layer are derived explicitly. This simplified model replaces a\ntraditional model consisting of the equation of motion of the levitated object,\ncoupled to a nonlinear partial differential equation, accounting for the\nbehavior of the entrapped gas. Due to the relatively simple form of the model\ndeveloped here, it constitutes a convenient foundation for model based control\nalgorithms, governing the slow dynamics of near-field acoustically levitated\nobjects.
