In\n1972, Ronald Coase conjectured that a duropolist who lacks commitment power\ncannot sell the good above the competitive price if the time between periods\napproaches zero. Coase's counterintuitive conjecture was later proven by Gul et\nal. (1986) under an infinite time horizon model with non-atomic consumers.\nRemarkably, the situation changes dramatically for atomic consumers and an\ninfinite time horizon. Bagnoli et al.

Indeed, we prove that for finite time horizons\nand atomic agents, in any equilibrium satisfying the standard skimming\nproperty, duropoly profits are at most an additive factor more than static\nmonopoly profits.

We\ninvestigate the behaviour of the local flow close to the interface between the\nsingle-phase and porous regions (governed by the incompressible Navier--Stokes\nand Darcy flow equations, respectively). We solve for the flow in these inner\nregions in the limits of low and high Reynolds number, facilitating an\nunderstanding of the nature of the transition from Poiseuille to plug to\nPoiseuille flow in each of these limits. Significant analytic progress is made\nin the high-Reynolds-number limit, and we explore in detail the rich boundary\nlayer structure that occurs. We consider the three-dimensional generalization\nto unsteady laminar flow through and around a tight-fitting highly permeable\ncylindrical porous obstacle within a Hele-Shaw cell. For the\nhigh-Reynolds-number limit, we give the coupling conditions and interfacial\nstress in terms of the outer flow variables, allowing information from a\nnonlinear three-dimensional problem to be obtained by solving a linear\ntwo-dimensional problem. Finally, we illustrate the utility of our analysis by\nconsidering the specific example of time-dependent forced far-field flow in a\nHele-Shaw cell containing a porous cylinder with a circular cross-section. We\ndetermine the internal stress within the porous obstacle, which is key for\ntissue engineering applications, and the interfacial stress on the boundary of\nthe porous obstacle, which has applications to biofilm erosion. In the\nhigh-Reynolds-number limit, we demonstrate that the fluid inertia can result in\nthe cylinder experiencing a time-independent net force, even when the far-field\nforcing is periodic with zero mean.\n","Comment: 49 pages with 15 figures.

We apply the model to a\ndendrochronology dataset comprising measurements from forest stands of varying\ncomposition, structure, and development stage in northeastern Minnesota.\nResults indicate average forest growth was most sensitive to variables\ndescribing climatic water deficit. Forest growth responses to water deficit\nwere partitioned into responses driven by climatic threshold exceedances and\ninteractions with forest tent caterpillar defoliation. Forest growth was both\nresistant and resilient to climate extremes with the majority of forest growth\nresponses occurring after multiple climatic threshold exceedances or insect\ndefoliation events. Forest growth was most sensitive to water deficit during\nperiods of high stem density following major regeneration events when average\ninter-tree competition was high. Results suggest that forest growth resistance\nand resilience to interactions between climate extremes and insect defoliation\ncan be increased through management steps such as thinning to reduce\ncompetition during early stages of stand development and small-group selection\nharvests to maintain forest structures characteristic of older, mature stands.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures"]}]

In that case,\nit may be easier to look for the second stop since naturalness requires both\nstops to be close to the weak scale. The current experimental searches for the\nsecond stop are based on the simplified model approach with the decay modes\n$\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 Z$ and $\\tilde{t}_2 \\to \\tilde{t}_1 h$.

The mathematical framework that we introduce describes this\nphenomenon, by taking into account \"natural parameters\" such as the eye-sight\nof the penguins, their cruising speed and the possible \"fear\" of animals.

We discuss the implications of these simulations, reviewing a number of\nrecent developments in the literature, and suggest a revision to the canonical\nmodel as it relates to the expected angular momentum content of gaseous halos\naround galaxies.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 3 figures.

Our key contribution is TerpreT, a domain-specific\nlanguage for expressing program synthesis problems. A TerpreT model is composed\nof a specification of a program representation and an interpreter that\ndescribes how programs map inputs to outputs. The inference task is to observe\na set of input-output examples and infer the underlying program. From a TerpreT\nmodel we automatically perform inference using four different back-ends:\ngradient descent (thus each TerpreT model can be seen as defining a\ndifferentiable interpreter), linear program (LP) relaxations for graphical\nmodels, discrete satisfiability solving, and the Sketch program synthesis\nsystem. TerpreT has two main benefits. First, it enables rapid exploration of a\nrange of domains, program representations, and interpreter models. Second, it\nseparates the model specification from the inference algorithm, allowing proper\ncomparisons between different approaches to inference.\n  We illustrate the value of TerpreT by developing several interpreter models\nand performing an extensive empirical comparison between alternative inference\nalgorithms on a variety of program models.

Based on\nthe estimated restricted Cobb-Douglas production function and the results\nobtained from the Solow residual equation, the annual growth rates of TFP were\nmeasured for each year. According to the findings, the average annual growth\nrate of TFP has been 2.94% during the time period of the present study. The\nother findings of this study indicate that the average contributions of TFPG,\nlabor accumulation and capital accumulation in the economic growth of the\nmining sector have been 56%, 23%, and 21%, respectively, during the time period\nof the study. As such, it can be concluded that the policy of benefiting from\navailable factors in the mining sector together with the policy of accumulating\nfactors have simultaneously caused the value-added growth of this sector.\nTherefore, considering the desired performance of the mining sector in terms of\nits sizable productivity growth, it can be argued that the mining sector can\naid Iran's economic development plans to achieve their assigned economic\nobjectives, one of which is to increase the share of total factor productivity\ngrowth in economic growth.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

However, inherent structure in our world and bias in\nour language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities,\nresulting in models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated\nsense of their capability.\n  We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance\nthe popular VQA dataset (Antol et al., ICCV 2015) by collecting complementary\nimages such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not\njust a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two\ndifferent answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced\nthan the original VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of\nimage-question pairs. Our complete balanced dataset will be publicly released\nas part of the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Challenge (VQA\nv2.0).\n  We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced\ndataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset,\nsuggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors.\nThis finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to\nbe a qualitative sense among practitioners.\n  Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images\nenables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to\nproviding an answer to the given (image, question) pair also provides a\ncounter-example based explanation - specifically, it identifies an image that\nis similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the\nsame question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users.\n"]}]
