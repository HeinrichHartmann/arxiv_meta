In particular, we analyze how far the\nresulting yields and slopes of the invariant-mass spectra can probe the\nlifetime and temperatures of the fireball. We find that dilepton radiation sets\nin after the initial overlap phase of the colliding nuclei of about 7 fm/c, and\nlasts for about 13 fm/c. This duration closely coincides with the development\nof the transverse collectivity of the baryons, thus establishing a direct\ncorrelation between hadronic collective effects and thermal EM radiation, and\nsupporting a near local equilibration of the system. This fireball \"lifetime\"\nis substantially smaller than the typical 20-30 fm/c that naive considerations\nof the density evolution alone would suggest.

In\nthis paper, we report a long laser pulse induced dual photoacoustic (LDPA)\nnonlinear effect, which originates from unsatisfied stress and thermal\nconfinements. Being different from conventional short laser pulse illumination,\nthe proposed method utilizes a long square-profile laser pulse to induce dual\nphotoacoustic signals. Without satisfying the stress confinement, the dual\nphotoacoustic signals are generated following the positive and negative edges\nof the long laser pulse. More interestingly, the first expansion-induced\nphotoacoustic signal exhibits positive waveform due to the initial sharp rising\nof temperature. On the contrary, the second contraction-induced photoacoustic\nsignal exhibits exactly negative waveform due to the falling of temperature, as\nwell as pulse-width-dependent signal amplitude which is caused by the\nconcurrent heat accumulation and thermal diffusion during the long laser\nillumination. An analytical model is derived to describe the generation of the\ndual photoacoustic pulses, incorporating Gruneisen saturation and thermal\ndiffusion effect, which is experimentally proved. Lastly, an alternate of LDPA\ntechnique using quasi-CW laser excitation is also introduced and demonstrated\nfor both super-contrast in vitro and in vivo imaging. Compared with existing\nnonlinear PA techniques, the proposed LDPA nonlinear effect could enable a much\nbroader range of potential applications.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The manuscript highlights the general regularities\nin a field on the grounds of strong interrelation between catalytic, kinetic\nand thermodynamic behaviour of the reaction system. The trials of the catalytic\nNH3 synthesis and the oscillatory NO+H2 reaction have revealed that the\nthermodynamics of the local structure determines the properties and\nmultiplicity of the reaction intermediates enabling the peculiar macroscopic\nkinetics and specific catalytic activity. Structure and activity of catalytic\nsites are correlated within a realistic model, where total undercoordination of\nadjacent surface atoms and enthalpy of local reaction is taken as a descriptor\nfor structure and activity, respectively. The model has specified the resonant\ncatalytic centers for NH3 synthesis on metal surfaces in close agreement with\nexperimental data. The basal planes of noble metals are less active than Fe-\nand Ru-based catalysts, whereas an extraordinary activity of small Pt, Ir and\nRh clusters can be expected. A strong advantage of imperfections compared to\nperfect areas in the surface wave nucleation is evaluated. Isothermal rate\noscillations in open heterogeneous catalytic reaction systems are expected\nunder the multiplicity of reaction intermediates fairly different in activity,\nproviding the steady state and reaction rout multiplicity. Switching between\nactive and inactive kinetic brunches gives rise to the explosive coverage\nchangeover that can be visualized as a traveling wave. A single pattern of\noscillations in the NO+H2 reaction includes the key role of intermediate NHad\nspecies providing the catalytic removal of strongly bound nitrogen. The driving\nforces, the feedback, and chemical interactions within the traveling waves are\nclearly understood.\n","Comment: 14200 words, 14 figures, 13 tables, 2 schemes, 119 references"]}]

Even though the matrices of the algebraic equation corresponding the\nnonlocal models are usually Toeplitz (denote a0 as the principal diagonal\nelement, a1 as the trailing diagonal element, etc). There are still some\ndifferences for the models in these two fields. For the model of anomalous\ndiffusion, a0/a1 is uniformly bounded; most of the time, a0/a1 of the model for\nperidyanmics is unbounded as the stepsize h tends to zero. Based on the uniform\nboundedness of a0/a1, the convergence of the two-grid method is well\nestablished [Chan, Chang, and Sun, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 19 (1998), pp.\n516--529; Pang and Sun, J. Comput.

This paper provides the\ndetailed proof of the convergence of the two-grid method for the nonlocal model\nof peridynamics. Some special cases of the full multigrid and the V-cycle\nmultigrid are also discussed. The numerical experiments are performed to verify\nthe convergence.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

We assume that in a technical system several processes\ninteract. If we observe these processes with sensors, we are able to model the\nobservations (samples) with a probabilistic model, where, in an ideal case, the\ncomponents of the parametric mixture density model we use, correspond to the\nprocesses in the real world. Eventually, at run-time, novel processes emerge in\nthe technical systems such as in the case of an unpredictable failure. As a\nconsequence, new kinds of samples are observed that require an adaptation of\nthe model. CANDIES relies on mixtures of Gaussians which can be used for\nclassification purposes, too. New processes may emerge in regions of the\nmodels' input spaces where few samples were observed before (low-density\nregions) or in regions where already many samples were available (high-density\nregions). The latter case is more difficult, but most existing solutions focus\non the former. Novelty detection in low- and high-density regions requires\ndifferent detection strategies. With CANDIES, we introduce a new technique to\ndetect novel processes in high-density regions by means of a fast online\ngoodness-of-fit test. For detection in low-density regions we combine this\napproach with a 2SND (Two-Stage-Novelty-Detector) which we presented in\npreliminary work.

These prompt neutrons have been used for active\ninterrogation to detect nuclear materials, the first such demonstration of a\nlaser-driven neutron source. During the experiments, delayed neutrons from\n$^9$Li decay was observed. It was identified by its characteristic half-life of\n178.3 ms.

These reactions\nhave energy thresholds of 18.42 and 14.26 MeV respectively, and we estimate the\n(d,2p) reaction to be the dominant source of $^9$Li production. Therefore, only\nthe higher-energy portion of the deuteron spectrum contributes to the\nproduction of the delayed neutrons. It was observed that the delayed-neutron\nyield decreases with increasing distance between the converter and the deuteron\nsource.

In the second case we\nalso prove that the exchange graph does not depend on the coefficients of $\\A$.\nBoth conjectures were formulated recently by Fomin and Zelevinsky.\n","Comment: Former Conjecture 2 split into Conjectures 2 and 3. Former Theorem 3\n  split into Theorems 4 and 5 accordingly. Former Section 2 split into Sections\n  2 and 3 accordingly. An error in the proof of case (i) of the former Theorem\n  3 (now Theorem 4) corrected, see 10 lines after equation (12)"]}]
