The patterns\ndisplayed by the two aforementioned quantities are found to hold for both low\nand high mutation rates. We discuss how these patterns can be exploited to\ndetermine the distribution of beneficial fitness effects in microbial\nexperiments.\n","Comment: Communicated to PLOS ONE"]}]

This occurs because the photonic crystal cavity resonances do\nnot form a complete set. By taking into account the dispersive mode profile, we\nformulate a mode coupling model that accurately describes the asymmetric\ndispersion without introducing any new free parameters.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Since the imitation mechanism is only partial, agents copy only one\nentry (randomly chosen) of another array (i.e. solution). In doing so, the\npopulation converges towards a shared solution, behaving like a spin system\nundergoing a cooling process, i.e. driven towards an ordered phase.

It is generally believed that matter is absorbed into\nblack holes via accretion disks, the state of which depends primarily on the\nmass-accretion rate. When this rate approaches the critical rate (the Eddington\nlimit), thermal instability is supposed to occur in the inner disc, causing\nrepetitive patterns of large-amplitude X-ray variability (oscillations) on\ntimescales of minutes to hours. In fact, such oscillations have been observed\nonly in sources with a high mass accretion rate, such as GRS 1915+105. These\nlarge-amplitude, relatively slow timescale, phenomena are thought to have\nphysical origins distinct from X-ray or optical variations with small\namplitudes and fast ($\\lesssim$10 sec) timescales often observed in other black\nhole binaries (e.g., XTE J1118+480 and GX 339-4). Here we report an extensive\nmulti-colour optical photometric data set of V404 Cygni, an X-ray transient\nsource containing a black hole of nine solar masses (and a conpanion star) at a\ndistance of 2.4 kiloparsecs. Our data show that optical oscillations on\ntimescales of 100 seconds to 2.5 hours can occur at mass-accretion rates more\nthan ten times lower than previously thought. This suggests that the accretion\nrate is not the critical parameter for inducing inner-disc instabilities.\nInstead, we propose that a long orbital period is a key condition for these\nlarge-amplitude oscillations, because the outer part of the large disc in\nbinaries with long orbital periods will have surface densities too low to\nmaintain sustained mass accretion to the inner part of the disc. The lack of\nsustained accretion -- not the actual rate -- would then be the critical factor\ncausing large-amplitude oscillations in long-period systems.\n","Comment: Published in Nature on January 7th, 2016"]}]

Isolated white dwarfs emit most of their power from ultraviolet\nto near-infrared wavelengths, but when in close orbits with less dense stars,\nwhite dwarfs can strip material from their companions, and the resulting mass\ntransfer can generate atomic line and X-ray emission, as well as near- and\nmid-infrared radiation if the white dwarf is magnetic. However, even in\nbinaries, white dwarfs are rarely detected at far-infrared or radio\nfrequencies. Here we report the discovery of a white dwarf / cool star binary\nthat emits from X-ray to radio wavelengths. The star, AR Scorpii (henceforth AR\nSco), was classified in the early 1970s as a delta-Scuti star, a common variety\nof periodic variable star. Our observations reveal instead a 3.56 hr period\nclose binary, pulsing in brightness on a period of 1.97 min. The pulses are so\nintense that AR Sco's optical flux can increase by a factor of four within 30\ns, and they are detectable at radio frequencies, the first such detection for\nany white dwarf system. They reflect the spin of a magnetic white dwarf which\nwe find to be slowing down on a 10^7 yr timescale. The spin-down power is an\norder of magnitude larger than that seen in electromagnetic radiation, which,\ntogether with an absence of obvious signs of accretion, suggests that AR Sco is\nprimarily spin-powered. Although the pulsations are driven by the white dwarf's\nspin, they originate in large part from the cool star. AR Sco's broad-band\nspectrum is characteristic of synchrotron radiation, requiring relativistic\nelectrons.

Both servers and\nclients may be added and/or removed from the system periodically, and the main\nobjectives of allocation algorithms are: the uniformity of the allocation, and\nthe number of moves after adding or removing a server or a client. The most\npopular solution for our dynamic settings is Consistent Hashing. However, the\nload balancing of consistent hashing is no better than a random assignment of\nclients to servers, so with $n$ of each, we expect many servers to be\noverloaded with $\\Theta(\\log n/ \\log\\log n)$ clients. In this paper, with $n$\nclients and $n$ servers, we get a guaranteed max-load of 2 while only moving an\nexpected constant number of clients for each update.\n  We take an arbitrary user specified balancing parameter $c=1+\\epsilon>1$.\nWith $m$ balls and $n$ bins in the system, we want no load above $\\lceil\ncm/n\\rceil$. Meanwhile we want to bound the expected number of balls that have\nto be moved when a ball or server is added or removed. Compared with general\nlower bounds without capacity constraints, we show that in our algorithm when a\nball or bin is inserted or deleted, the expected number of balls that have to\nbe moved is increased only by a multiplicative factor $O({1\\over \\epsilon^2})$\nfor $\\epsilon \\le 1$ (Theorem 4) and by a factor $1+O(\\frac{\\log c}c)$ for\n$\\epsilon\\ge 1$ (Theorem 3).

We accurately determine the\nposition of the hard-wall as a function of oscillator space parameters, derive\nextrapolation formulas for the energy and other observables, and discuss the\nextension of this approach to higher angular momentum.\n  Nucleon knockout reactions have been widely used to study and understand\nnuclear properties. Such an analysis implicitly assumes that the effects of the\nprobe can be separated from the physics of the target nucleus. This\nfactorization between nuclear structure and reaction components depends on the\nrenormalization scale and scheme, and has not been well understood. But it is\npotentially critical for interpreting experiments and for extracting\nprocess-independent nuclear properties. We use similarity renormalization group\n(SRG) transformations to systematically study the scale dependence of\nfactorization for the simplest knockout process of deuteron\nelectrodisintegration. We find that the extent of scale dependence depends\nstrongly on kinematics, but in a systematic way. Based on examination of the\nrelevant overlap matrix elements, we are able to qualitatively explain and even\npredict the nature of scale dependence based on the kinematics under\nconsideration.\n","Comment: PhD thesis"]}]

We show that any $n$-point quasimetric\nspace supported on a graph of treewidth $t$ admits a random embedding into\nquasiultrametric spaces with distortion $O(t \\log^2 n)$, where\nquasiultrametrics are a natural generalization of ultrametrics.

We experiment with Forum for Information Retrieval and Evaluation\n(FIRE) 2008 and 2012 datasets for Hindi to English CLIR. The proposed word\nembedding based approach outperforms the basic dictionary based approach by 70%\nand when the word embeddings are combined with the dictionary, the hybrid\napproach beats the baseline dictionary based method by 77%. It outperforms the\nEnglish monolingual baseline by 15%, when combined with the translations\nobtained from Google Translate and Dictionary.\n","Comment: 17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and\n  Computational Linguistics"]}]

A\nmuon may sustain hundreds of interactions before it is detected by the\nexperiment. Since a small systematic uncertainty repeated hundreds of times may\nlead to sizable errors, requirements on the precision of the muon propagation\ncode are very stringent. A new tool for propagating muon and tau charged\nleptons through matter that is believed to meet these requirements is presented\nhere. An overview of the program is given and some results of its application\nare discussed.\n","Comment: MMC can be downloaded at http://icecube.wisc.edu/~dima/work/MUONPR/"]}]
