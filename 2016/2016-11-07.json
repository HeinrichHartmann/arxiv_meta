We\ncalculate the maximal transverse Lyapunov exponent to evaluate the asymptotic\nstability of the complete synchronization manifold of each of the main and the\ncorresponding auxiliary systems, which in turn ensures the stability of the GS\nmanifold between the main systems.

In order to cope with the sampling rate bottleneck, new sampling\nmethods have been proposed that sample below the Nyquist rate. However, such\ntechniques decrease the signal to noise ratio (SNR), deteriorating the\nperformance of subsequent energy detection. Cyclostationary detection, which\nexploits the periodic property of communication signal statistics, absent in\nstationary noise, is a natural candidate for this setting. In this work, we\nconsider cyclic spectrum recovery from sub-Nyquist samples, in order to achieve\nboth efficiency and robustness to noise. To that end, we propose a structured\ncompressed sensing algorithm, that extends orthogonal matching pursuit to\naccount for the structure imposed by cyclostationarity.

In\nparticular, in non sparse settings, the cyclic spectrum can be recovered at\n$4/5$ of the Nyquist rate. If the signal of interest is sparse, then the\nsampling rate may be further reduced to $8/5$ of the Landau rate. Once the\ncyclic spectrum is recovered, we estimate the number of transmissions that\ncompose the input signal, along with their carrier frequencies and bandwidths.\nSimulations show that cyclostationary detection outperforms energy detection in\nlow SNRs in the sub-Nyquist regime.

In this configuration, dominated by the disk in\nthe center, a bar forms relatively quickly, after 1 Gyr of evolution. This is\nimmediately followed by the formation of two manifold-driven spiral arms and\nthe outflow of stars that modifies the potential in the vicinity of the bar,\napparently shifting the position of the L_1/L_2 Lagrange points. This\nmodification leads to the shortening of the bar and the creation of a next\ngeneration of manifold-driven spiral arms at a smaller radius. The process\nrepeats itself a few times over the next 0.5 Gyr resulting in further\nsubstantial weakening and shortening of the bar. The time when the damping\ncomes to an end coincides with the first buckling episode in the bar which\nrebuilds the orbital structure so that no more new spiral arms are formed. The\nmorphology of the bar and the spiral structure at this time show remarkable\nsimilarity to the present properties of the Milky Way.

Aims: We aim at detecting and characterizing\nsubstellar+stellar companions to the giant star HD 59686 A (HR 2877, HIP\n36616). Methods: We obtained high precision radial velocity (RV) measurements\nof the star HD 59686 A.

For continuous time models in which individuals disperse\nthroughout their lifetime, it has been shown that a balanced dispersal\nstrategy, which results in an ideal free distribution, is evolutionary stable\nin spatially varying but temporally constant environments. Many species,\nhowever, primarily disperse prior to reproduction (natal dispersal) and less\ncommonly between reproductive events (breeding dispersal). As demographic and\ndispersal terms combine in a multiplicative way for models of natal dispersal,\nrather than the additive way for the previously studied models, we develop new\nmathematical methods to study the evolution of natal dispersal for\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time models. A fundamental ecological dichotomy is\nidentified for the non-trivial equilibrium of these models: (i) the per-capita\ngrowth rates for individuals in all patches is equal to zero, or (ii)\nindividuals in some patches experience negative per-capita growth rates, while\nindividuals in other patches experience positive per-capita growth rates. The\nfirst possibility corresponds to an ideal-free distribution, while the second\npossibility corresponds to a \"source-sink\" spatial structure. We prove that\npopulations with a dispersal strategy leading to an ideal-free distribution\ndisplace populations with dispersal strategy leading to a source-sink spatial\nstructure. When there are patches which can not sustain a population,\nideal-free strategies can be achieved by sedentary populations, and we show\nthat these populations can displace populations with any irreducible dispersal\nstrategy. Collectively, these results support that evolution selects for natal\nor breeding dispersal strategies which lead to ideal-free distributions in\nspatially heterogenous, but temporally homogenous, environments.\n","Comment: Revision correcting several minor errors"]}]

The correctness of subtyping\nrelations has been usually provided as the soundness for type safety. The\nconverse direction, the completeness, has been largely ignored in spite of its\nusefulness to define the largest subtyping relation ensuring type safety. This\npaper formalises preciseness (i.e. both soundness and completeness) of\nsubtyping for mobile processes and studies it for the synchronous and the\nasynchronous session calculi. We first prove that the well-known session\nsubtyping, the branching-selection subtyping, is sound and complete for the\nsynchronous calculus. Next we show that in the asynchronous calculus, this\nsubtyping is incomplete for type-safety: that is, there exist session types T\nand S such that\n  T can safely be considered as a subtype of S, but T < S is not derivable by\nthe subtyping. We then propose an asynchronous subtyping system which is sound\nand complete for the asynchronous calculus. The method gives a general guidance\nto design rigorous channel-based subtypings respecting desired safety\nproperties. Both the synchronous and the asynchronous calculus are first\nconsidered with lin ear channels only, and then they are extended with session\ninitialisations and c ommunications of expressions (including shared channels).\n"]}]

Orbits then typically\nfollow the slow manifold, which hence act as a transient attractor, performing\nin addition rapid transitions between distinct branches of the slow manifold on\nthe time scales of the fast variables. These intermittent transitions\ncorrespond to state switching within transient state dynamics. A full\ncharacterization of slow manifolds is often difficult, e. g. in neural networks\nwith a large number of dynamical variables, due to the generically complex\nshape. We therefore introduce here the concept of locally attracting points,\nthe target points. The set of target points is, by definition, the subsets of\nthe slow manifold guiding the time evolution of a given trajectory. The motion\nof the target points, also called attractor metadynamics, by definition takes\nplace on the slow manifold guiding the time evolution of a given trajectory.\n  We consider here systems, in which the overall dynamics settles in the limit\nof long times either in a limit cycle, or in a chaotic attractor. The set of\ntarget points then decomposes into one-dimensional (or fractal) branches, which\ncan be analyzed directly. Here we examine the role of target points as\ntransiently stable attractors in an autonomously active recurrent neural\nnetwork.

After optimizing the\nGMM-based objective function, given an observed set of binaural features, both\nthe number of sources and their locations are estimated by selecting the GMM\ncomponents with the largest priors.

In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, called\n\\emph{Parallel Voting Decision Tree (PV-Tree)}, to tackle this challenge. After\npartitioning the training data onto a number of (e.g., $M$) machines, this\nalgorithm performs both local voting and global voting in each iteration.

Finally, the full-grained\nhistograms of the globally top-$2k$ attributes are collected from local\nmachines in order to identify the best (most informative) attribute and its\nsplit point. PV-Tree can achieve a very low communication cost (independent of\nthe total number of attributes) and thus can scale out very well. Furthermore,\ntheoretical analysis shows that this algorithm can learn a near optimal\ndecision tree, since it can find the best attribute with a large probability.\nOur experiments on real-world datasets show that PV-Tree significantly\noutperforms the existing parallel decision tree algorithms in the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and efficiency.\n"]}]

In legacy SISO\ntransmitters and small MIMO arrays, OOB radiation is well understood and is\ncommonly handled by digital compensation techniques. In large arrays, however,\nnew phenomena and hardware limitations have to be considered: First, signals\ncan be radiated directionally, which might focus the OOB radiation. Second,\nlow-complexity hardware with poor linearity has to be used for cost reasons,\nwhich increases the relative amount of OOB radiation. Given that massive MIMO\nand millimeter wave communication rely on base stations with a huge number of\nantennas, the spatial behavior of OOB radiation from large arrays will have\nsignificant implications for future hardware requirements. We show that, if the\nOOB radiation is beamformed, its array gain is never larger than that of the\nin-band signal. In many cases, the OOB radiation is even close to isotropic\nalso when the in-band signal is highly directive. With the same total radiated\npower, the OOB radiation from large arrays is therefore never more severe than\nfrom a legacy system with the same adjacent-channel-leakage ratio. The OOB\nradiation is even less detrimental than from a legacy system since the high\narray gain of the in-band signal allows large arrays to radiate less total\npower than legacy systems. We also show how OOB radiation from large arrays\nvaries with location in static propagation environments and how these effects\nvanish when averaged over the small-scale fading.

Based on this model, we focus on the problem\nof inferring the connectivity that best explains the data samples at different\nvertices of a graph that is a priori unknown. We concentrate on the case where\nthe observed data is actually the sum of heat diffusion processes, which is a\nquite common model for data on networks or other irregular structures. We cast\na new graph learning problem and solve it with an efficient nonconvex\noptimization algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real world data\nfinally illustrate the benefits of the proposed graph learning framework and\nconfirm that the data structure can be efficiently learned from data\nobservations only. We believe that our algorithm will help solving key\nquestions in diverse application domains such as social and biological network\nanalysis where it is crucial to unveil proper geometry for data understanding\nand inference.\n"]}]

We\nfirst train a series of deep neural networks to predict eight-class secondary\nstructure labels given a protein's amino acid sequence information and find\nthat using recent methods for regularization, such as dropout and weight-norm\nconstraining, leads to measurable gains in accuracy. We then adapt recent\nconvolutional neural network architectures--Inception, ReSNet, and DenseNet\nwith Batch Normalization--to the problem of protein structure prediction. These\nconvolutional architectures make heavy use of multi-scale filter layers that\nsimultaneously compute features on several scales, and use residual connections\nto prevent underfitting. Using a carefully modified version of these\narchitectures, we achieve state-of-the-art performance of 70.0% per amino acid\naccuracy on the public CB513 benchmark dataset. Finally, we explore additions\nfrom sequence-to-sequence learning, altering the model to make its predictions\nconditioned on both the protein's amino acid sequence and its past secondary\nstructure labels.
