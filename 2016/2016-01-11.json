The framework, aimed at seamlessly generalizing error\nbackpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron setting, is based strictly\non spike timing and avoids invoking concepts pertaining to spike rates or\nprobabilistic models of spiking. The derivation is founded on two innovations.\nFirst, an error functional is proposed that compares the spike train emitted by\nthe output neuron of the network to the desired spike train by way of their\nputative impact on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps\nthe need for spike alignment and leads to closed form solutions for all\nquantities of interest. Second, virtual assignment of weights to spikes rather\nthan synapses enables a perturbation analysis of individual spike times and\nsynaptic weights of the output as well as all intermediate neurons in the\nnetwork, which yields the gradients of the error functional with respect to the\nsaid entities. Learning proceeds via a gradient descent mechanism that\nleverages these quantities. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of\nthe proposed learning framework.

This problem is\ninteresting since, on equiregular sub-Riemannian manifolds, there is always an\nintrinsic volume (e.g. Popp's one $P$) but not a canonical choice of\ncomplement. The result depends heavily on the type of structure under\ninvestigation. On contact structures, for every volume $\\omega$, there exists a\nunique complement $c$ such that $\\Delta_\\omega=L^c$. On Carnot groups, if $H$\nis the Haar volume, then there always exists a complement $c$ such that\n$\\Delta_H=L^c$. However this complement is not unique in general.

Inference of the shear\npower spectrum is a powerful intermediate product for a cosmic shear analysis,\nsince it requires very few model assumptions and can be used to perform\ninference on a wide range of cosmological models \\emph{a posteriori} without\nloss of information. We show that joint posterior for the shear map and power\nspectrum can be sampled effectively by Gibbs sampling, iteratively drawing\nsamples from the map and power spectrum, each conditional on the other. This\napproach neatly circumvents difficulties associated with complicated survey\ngeometry and masks that plague frequentist power spectrum estimators, since the\npower spectrum inference provides prior information about the field in masked\nregions at every sampling step. We demonstrate this approach for inference of\ntomographic shear $E$-mode, $B$-mode and $EB$-cross power spectra from a\nsimulated galaxy shear catalogue with a number of important features; galaxies\ndistributed on the sky and in redshift with photometric redshift uncertainties,\nrealistic random ellipticity noise for every galaxy and a complicated survey\nmask. The obtained posterior distributions for the tomographic power spectrum\ncoefficients recover the underlying simulated power spectra for both $E$- and\n$B$-modes.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

Roughly speaking, a curve is\n$\\kappa$-packed if the length of its intersection with any ball of radius $r$\nis at most $\\kappa \\cdot r$, and a curve is $\\kappa$-bounded if the sub-curve\nbetween two curve points does not go too far from the two points compared to\nthe distance between the two points. In backbone sequences, consecutive points\nare spaced at approximately equal distances apart, and no two points lie very\nclose together. Recent results suggest that a subquadratic algorithm for DTW or\nED is unlikely for an arbitrary pair of point sequences even for $d=1$. Our\nalgorithms work by constructing a small set of rectangular regions that cover\nthe entries of the dynamic programming table commonly used for these distance\nmeasures. The weights of entries inside each rectangle are roughly the same, so\nwe are able to use efficient procedures to approximately compute the cheapest\npaths through these rectangles.\n"]}]

Although the mobility of bulk organic semiconductors has increased\ndramatically, direct probing of intrinsic charge transport in the\ntwo-dimensional limit has not been possible due to excessive disorders and\ntraps in ultrathin organic thin films. Here, highly ordered mono- to\ntetra-layer pentacene crystals are realized by van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy on\nhexagonal BN. We find that the charge transport is dominated by hopping in the\nfirst conductive layer, but transforms to band-like in subsequent layers. Such\nabrupt phase transition is attributed to strong modulation of the molecular\npacking by interfacial vdW interactions, as corroborated by quantitative\nstructural characterization and density functional theory calculations. The\nstructural modulation becomes negligible beyond the second conductive layer,\nleading to a mobility saturation thickness of only ~3nm.

One such structured signal model - which\nforms the focus of this paper - is the local sparsity in levels class. This\nclass has recently found applications in problems such as compressive imaging,\nmulti-sensor acquisition systems and sparse regularization in inverse problems.\nIn this paper we present uniform recovery guarantees for this class when the\nmeasurement matrix corresponds to a subsampled isometry. We do this by\nestablishing a variant of the standard restricted isometry property for the\nsparsity in levels class, known as the restricted isometry property in levels.\nInterestingly, besides the usual log factors, our uniform recovery guarantees\nare simpler and less stringent than existing nonuniform recovery guarantees.\nFor the particular case of discrete Fourier sampling with Haar wavelet\nsparsity, a corollary of our main theorem yields a new recovery guarantee which\nimproves over the current state-of-the-art.\n"]}]
