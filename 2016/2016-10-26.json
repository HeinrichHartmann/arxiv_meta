While there has been significant progress\nregarding this problem and its variants, one basic shortcoming of the models is\nthat they lack the flexibility in the way the budget is allocated to\nindividuals.

We use lattice\nMonte Carlo methods to determine essential quantities like the energy, which we\ncompute as a function of coupling strength and particle number in the regime\nfrom few to many particles. Many-fermion systems bound by hard walls display\nnon-trivial density profiles characterized by so-called Friedel oscillations\n(which are similar to those observed in harmonic traps). In non-interacting\nsystems, the characteristic length scale of the oscillations is set by (2\nkF)^(-1), where kF is the Fermi momentum, while repulsive interactions tend to\ngenerate Wigner-crystal oscillations of period (4 kF)^(-1). Based on the\nnon-interacting result, we find a remarkably simple parametrization of the\ndensity profiles of the attractively interacting case, which we generalize to\nthe one-body density matrix. While the total momentum is not a conserved\nquantity in the presence of hard walls, the magnitude of the momentum does\nprovide a good quantum number.

In this\npaper, we run simulated experiments and use real survival data to build upon\nthe risk-regression architecture proposed by Faraggi and Simon. We demonstrate\nthat our model, DeepSurv, not only works as well as other survival models but\nactually outperforms in predictive ability on survival data with linear and\nnonlinear risk functions. We then show that the neural network can also serve\nas a recommender system by including a categorical variable representing a\ntreatment group. This can be used to provide personalized treatment\nrecommendations based on an individual's calculated risk. We provide an open\nsource Python module that implements these methods in order to advance research\non deep learning and survival analysis.\n"]}]

Here we present new results that include a 15-dimensional\nprecessing-spin waveform model (precessing EOBNR) developed within the EOB\nformalism. We find good agreement with the parameters estimated previously [2],\nand we quote updated component masses of $35^{+5}_{-3}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ and\n$30^{+3}_{-4}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ (where errors correspond to 90% symmetric\ncredible intervals). We also present slightly tighter constraints on the\ndimensionless spin magnitudes of the two black holes, with a primary spin\nestimate $0.65$ and a secondary spin estimate $0.75$ at 90% probability.\nReference [2] estimated the systematic parameter-extraction errors due to\nwaveform-model uncertainty by combining the posterior probability densities of\nprecessing IMRPhenom and nonprecessing EOBNR. Here we find that the two\nprecessing-spin models are in closer agreement, suggesting that these\nsystematic errors are smaller than previously quoted.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]

This process induces inhomogeneities in the gas\ndensity distribution (clumping) which need to be taken into account to recover\nthe physical properties of the intracluster medium (ICM) at large radii. Aims.\nWe studied the thermodynamic properties in the outskirts (R > R500) of the\nmassive galaxy cluster Abell 2142 by combining the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ)\neffect with the X-ray signal. Methods. We combined the SZ pressure profile\nmeasured by Planck with the XMM-Newton gas density profile to recover radial\nprofiles of temperature, entropy and hydrostatic mass out to 2R500. We used a\nmethod that is insensitive to clumping to recover the gas density, and we\ncompared the results with traditional X-ray measurement techniques. Results.\nWhen taking clumping into account, our joint SZ/X-ray entropy profile is\nconsistent with the predictions from pure gravitational collapse, whereas a\nsignificant entropy flattening is found when the effect of clumping is\nneglected. The hydrostatic mass profile recovered using joint X-ray/SZ data\nagrees with that obtained from spectroscopic X-ray measurements and with mass\nreconstructions obtained through weak lensing and galaxy kinematics.\nConclusions. We found that clumping can explain the entropy flattening observed\nby Suzaku in the outskirts of several clusters. When using a method insensitive\nto clumping for the reconstruction of the gas density, the thermodynamic\nproperties of Abell 2142 are compatible with the assumption that the thermal\ngas pressure sustains gravity and that the entropy is injected at accretion\nshocks, with no need to evoke more exotic physics. Our results highlight the\nneed for X-ray observations with sufficient spatial resolution, and large\ncollecting area, to understand the processes at work in cluster outer regions.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 32 figures, accepted in the journal A&A"]}]

L1451 is the survey region with the lowest level of star\nformation activity---it contains no confirmed protostars.

HCO+ has the broadest velocity dispersion,\nnear 0.3 km/s on average, compared to ~0.15 km/s for the other molecules, thus\nrepresenting a range from supersonic to subsonic gas motions. Our non-binary\ndendrogram analysis reveals that the dense gas traced by each molecule has\nsimilar hierarchical structure, and that gas surrounding the candidate first\nhydrostatic core (FHSC), L1451-mm, and other previously detected single-dish\ncontinuum clumps have similar hierarchical structure; this suggests that\ndifferent sub-regions of L1451 are fragmenting on the pathway to forming young\nstars.

In\nthe UV band, where higher spectral resolution is available, these lines are\ncharacterized by rather complex profiles whose origin is still not clear.\n  Aims. We investigate the origin of UV and X-ray emission at impact regions of\ndensity structured (fragmented) accretion streams.We study if and how the\nstream fragmentation and the resulting structure of the post-shock region\ndetermine the observed profiles of UV and X-ray emission lines.\n  Methods. We model the impact of an accretion stream consisting of a series of\ndense blobs onto the chromosphere of a CTTS through 2D MHD simulations.

The impacts of accreting blobs onto the stellar chromosphere produce\nreverse shocks propagating through the blobs and shocked upflows.

Sentinel will be able\nto find 50% of all impactors larger than 40 meters in a 6.5 year survey. The\nSentinel mission concept is shown to be as effective as any survey in finding\nobjects bigger than D=140 m but is more effective when applied to finding\nsmaller objects on Earth-impacting orbits. Sentinel is also more effective at\nfinding objects of interest for human exploration that benefit from lower\npropulsion requirements. To explore the interaction between space and ground\nsearch programs, we also study a case where Sentinel is combined with the Large\nSynoptic Survey Telescope and show the benefit of placing a space-based\nobservatory in an orbit that reduces the overlap in search regions with a\nground-based telescope. In this case, Sentinel+LSST can find more than 70% of\nthe impactors larger than 40 meters assuming a 6.5 year lifetime for Sentinel\nand 10 years for LSST.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 18 figures, 13 tables, accepted 2016-07-11 for publication\n  in the Astronomical Journal"]}]

We decomposed the observed GC/UCD mass function into\nindividual SC populations and converted $M_{\\mathrm{max}}$ of each SC\npopulation to an SFR. The overall distribution of SFRs reveals how the GC/UCD\nsample formed.

This ~1\nGyr-old 400K dwarf is at a distance of 8pc and has a mass around 5 M_Jupiter.\nWe observed W1738 using two near-infrared filters at lambda~1um, Y and J, on\nGemini observatory, and two mid-infrared filters at lambda~4um, [3.6] and\n[4.5], on the Spitzer observatory. Twenty-four hours were spent on the source\nby Spitzer on each of June 30 and October 30 2013 UT. Between these\nobservations, around 5 hours were spent on the source by Gemini on each of July\n17 and August 23 2013 UT. The mid-infrared light curves show significant\nevolution between the two observations separated by four months. We find that a\ndouble sinusoid can be fit to the [4.5] data, where one sinusoid has a period\nof 6.0 +/- 0.1 hours and the other a period of 3.0 +/- 0.1 hours. The\nnear-infrared observations suggest variability with a ~3.0 hour period,\nalthough only at a <~2 sigma confidence level. We interpret our results as\nshowing that the Y dwarf has a 6.0 +/- 0.1 hour rotation period, with one or\nmore large-scale surface features being the source of variability. The\npeak-to-peak amplitude of the light curve at [4.5] is 3%. The amplitude of the\nnear-infrared variability, if real, may be as high as 5 to 30%. Intriguingly,\nthis size of variability and the wavelength dependence can be reproduced by\natmospheric models that include patchy KCl and Na_2S clouds and associated\nsmall changes in surface temperature. The small number of large features, and\nthe timescale for evolution of the features, is very similar to what is seen in\nthe atmospheres of the solar system gas giants.\n","Comment: Accepted by ApJ July 26 2016.

As the\ndiffuse galactic emission dominates the signal, the large scale morphology of\nthe MW has been modelled accordingly and was included in a maximum likelihood\nanalysis.

We analyse bounds for the best position estimation of a stellar-like\nobject on a CCD detector array in a Bayesian setting where the position is\nunknown, but where we have access to a prior distribution. In contrast to a\nparametric setting where we estimate a parameter from observations, the\nBayesian approach estimates a random object (i.e., the position is a random\nvariable) from observations that are statistically dependent on the position.\n  Methods. We characterize the Bayesian Cramer-Rao (CR) that bounds the minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) of the best estimator of the position of a point\nsource on a linear CCD-like detector, as a function of the properties of\ndetector, the source, and the background.\n  Results.

Once the planets have,\nfor the most part, assembled after a giant impact phase, they continue to be\nbombarded by a multitude of planetesimals left over from accretion.

An added complication is that analysis of lunar samples indicates the\nMoon does not preserve convincing evidence for a late veneer like Earth.\nSecond, the expected chondritic veneer component on Mars is 0.06 weight\npercent. Third, the flux of terrestrial impactors must have been low (\n<=10^(-6) M_earth/Myr) to avoid wholesale melting of Earth's crust after\n4.4~Ga, and to simultaneously match the number of observed lunar basins. This\nconclusion leads to an Hadean eon which is more clement than assumed\npreviously.

Algorithms for identifying dense subgraphs are\nused in biology, in finance, in spam detection, etc. Standard formulations of\nthis problem such as the problem of finding the maximum clique of a graph are\nhard to solve. However, some tractable formulations of the problem have also\nbeen proposed, focusing mainly on optimizing some density function, such as the\ndegree density and the triangle density. However, maximization of degree\ndensity usually leads to large subgraphs with small density. In this paper, we\nintroduce the k-clique-graph densest subgraph problem, k >= 3, a novel\nformulation for the discovery of dense subgraphs. Given an input graph, its\nk-clique-graph is a new graph created from the input graph where each vertex of\nthe new graph corresponds to a k-clique of the input graph and two vertices are\nconnected with an edge if they share a common (k-1)-clique. We define a simple\ndensity function, the k-clique-graph density, which gives compact and at the\nsame time dense subgraphs, and we project its resulting subgraphs back to the\ninput graph. In this paper we focus on the triangle-graph densest subgraph\nproblem obtained for k=3. To optimize the proposed function, we provide an\nexact algorithm. Furthermore, we present an efficient greedy approximation\nalgorithm that scales well to larger graphs. We evaluate the proposed\nalgorithms on real datasets and compare them with other algorithms in terms of\nthe size and the density of the extracted subgraphs. The results verify the\nability of the proposed algorithms in finding high-quality subgraphs in terms\nof size and density.

Shared spaces constitute considerable office space\narea, in which most office employees perform their meetings and daily tasks,\nand therefore the ACs in these areas have significant impact on the energy\nusage of the entire office building. The cost of this energy consumption,\nhowever, is not paid by the shared space users, and the AC's temperature\nset-point is not determined based on the users' preferences. This latter factor\nis compounded by the fact that different people may have different choices of\ntemperature set-points and sensitivities to change of temperature. Therefore,\nit is a challenging task to design an office policy to decide on a particular\nset-point based on such a diverse preference set. As a result, users are not\naware of the energy consumption in shared spaces, which may potentially\nincrease the energy wastage and related cost of office buildings. In this\ncontext, this paper proposes an energy policy for an office shared space by\nexploiting an established temperature control mechanism. In particular, we\nchoose meeting rooms in an office building as the test case and design a policy\naccording to which each user of the room can give a preference on the\ntemperature set-point and is paid for felt discomfort if the set-point is not\nfixed according to the given preference. On the other hand, users who enjoy the\nthermal comfort compensate the other users of the room. Thus, the policy\nenables the users to be cognizant and responsible for the payment on the energy\nconsumption of the office space they are sharing, and at the same time ensures\nthat the users are satisfied either via thermal comfort or through incentives.\nThe policy is also shown to be beneficial for building management.

It is particularly important in the\npresence of parallel imaging acceleration, where the noise distribution can\ncontain severe spatial heterogeneities. If the parallel imaging reconstruction\nis a linear process, an exact noise analysis is possible by taking into account\nthe correlations between all the samples involved. However, for k-space based\ntechniques like GRAPPA, the exact analysis has been considered computationally\nprohibitive due to the very large size of the noise covariance matrices\nrequired to characterize the noise propagation from k-space to image-space.\nPrevious methods avoid this computational burden by approximating the GRAPPA\nreconstruction as a pixel-wise linear operation performed in the image-space.\nHowever, these methods are not exact in the presence of non-uniform k-space\nundersampling (e.g.: containing a calibration region).

In\nthis article the same problem is considered for spin-1/2 particle in the Dirac\nequation.

Moreover the orthogonality\nproperty is also failed, while the total probability is finite in the certain\narea of the model-parameters. Therefore, we are inclined to conclude that this\nadditional solution in the Dirac equation must be ignored and restrict\nourselves only by normal (standard) solutions.\n  Because the question is to determine the asymptotic behaviour of wave\nfunction at the origin, using the radial equations, is natural. The system of\nDirac radial equations is of the first order. Usual practice is to pass to the\nsecond order single radial equation, called the reduced equation, instead of a\nsystem.

In this essay, I focus on this subject of causal continuity and its\nrelated issues in classical and quantum physics.\n","Comment: Invited talk delivered at the III Adriatico Research Conference on\n  Quantum Interferometry, ICTP, March 1-5,1999.
