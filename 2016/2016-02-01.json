Given an RNA sequence, the goal of the RNA folding problem is to find\na maximum cardinality set of crossing-free pairs of the form $\\{A,U\\}$ or\n$\\{C,G\\}$. The problem is central in bioinformatics and has received much\nattention over the years.

The fluid dynamics at the stage of development in which\nthe trabeculae form is particularly complex, given the balance between inertial\nand viscous forces. Vortices, which cause changes in the magnitude and\ndirection of flow, are sensitive to small perturbations in scale, morphology,\nand unsteadiness of the flow. The immersed boundary method was used to solve\nthe fluid-structure interaction problem of fluid flow moving through an\nidealized chamber with trabeculae. Trabeculae heights were varied, and\nsimulations were conducted for Reynolds numbers ($Re$) ranging from $0.01$ to\n$100$. Using either steady or pulsatile parabolic inflow conditions, both\nintracardial and intertrabecular vortices formed for biologically relevant\nparameter values. The bifurcation from smooth streaming flow to vortical flow\ndepends upon the pulsation frequency, trabeculae geometry, and $Re$. Vorticity\ncan be important in inducing shear stress at the endothelial layer and mixing\nwithin the developing chambers, which is believed to aid in chamber\nmorphogenesis, valvulogenesis, and the formation of the trabeculae themselves.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Moreover, CNN features are also transferable among different domains.\nOn the other hand, traditional dictionarybased features (such as BoW and SPM)\ncontain much more local discriminative and structural information, which is\nimplicitly embedded in the images. To further improve the performance, in this\npaper, we propose to combine CNN with dictionarybased models for scene\nrecognition and visual domain adaptation. Specifically, based on the well-tuned\nCNN models (e.g., AlexNet and VGG Net), two dictionary-based representations\nare further constructed, namely mid-level local representation (MLR) and\nconvolutional Fisher vector representation (CFV). In MLR, an efficient\ntwo-stage clustering method, i.e., weighted spatial and feature space spectral\nclustering on the parts of a single image followed by clustering all\nrepresentative parts of all images, is used to generate a class-mixture or a\nclassspecific part dictionary. After that, the part dictionary is used to\noperate with the multi-scale image inputs for generating midlevel\nrepresentation. In CFV, a multi-scale and scale-proportional GMM training\nstrategy is utilized to generate Fisher vectors based on the last convolutional\nlayer of CNN. By integrating the complementary information of MLR, CFV and the\nCNN features of the fully connected layer, the state-of-the-art performance can\nbe achieved on scene recognition and domain adaptation problems. An interested\nfinding is that our proposed hybrid representation (from VGG net trained on\nImageNet) is also complementary with GoogLeNet and/or VGG-11 (trained on\nPlace205) greatly.\n","Comment: Accepted by TCSVT on Sep.2015"]}]

Here, we\npresent direct experimental evidence that SWCNT bundling is detrimental for\ntheir performance. We combine floating catalyst synthesis of non-bundled,\nhigh-quality SWCNTs with an aggregation chamber, in which bundles with mean\ndiameters ranging from 1.38 to 2.90 nm are formed from identical 3 microns long\nSWCNTs. The as-deposited TCFs from 1.38 nm bundles showed sheet resistances of\n310 Ohms/sq. at 90% transparency, while those from larger bundles of 1.80 and\n2.90 nm only reached values of 475 and 670 Ohms/sq., respectively. Based on\nthese observations, we elucidate how networks formed by smaller bundles perform\nbetter due to their greater interconnectivity at a given optical density.\nFinally, we present a semi-empirical model for TCF performance as a function of\nSWCNT mean length and bundle diameter. This gives an estimate for the ultimate\nperformance of non-doped, random network mixed-metallicity SWCNT TCFs at ~80\nOhms/sq. and 90% transparency.\n"]}]

Numerical models have\ncontributed significantly towards this understanding, and more recently,\nadjoint-based modelling has been employed to optimise the positioning of the\nturbines in an array in an automated way and improve on simple, regular\nman-made configurations. Adjoint-based optimisation of high-resolution and\nideally 3D transient models is generally a very computationally expensive\nproblem.

We compute the\nWeil-Petersson Poisson structure on T(S) in this system of coordinates and we\nprove that it limits pointwise to the piecewise-linear Poisson structure\ndefined by Kontsevich on the arc complex of S. As a byproduct of the proof, we\nobtain a formula for the first-order variation of the distance between two\nclosed geodesics under Fenchel-Nielsen deformation.\n","Comment: 44 pages, 12 figures (LaTeX 2e).
