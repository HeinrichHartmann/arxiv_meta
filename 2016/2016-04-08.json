A suitable mathematical\nframework is developed, connecting the slow dynamics on the tangent subspaces\nto the infinite-time linear response of the mean state to a constant external\nforcing at the fast variables. Additionally, it is shown that the uncoupled\ndynamics for the slow variables may remain chaotic while the complete\nmultiscale system loses chaos and becomes completely predictable at the slow\nvariables through increasing chaos and turbulence at the fast variables.

We show\nthat the question whether such a theory can be treated as a kind of\n\"generalization\" of the quantum theory of the two-qubit system cannot be\nanswered positively. Some of its features put it closer to the quantum world,\nfor example measurements must be destructive, on the other hand the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relations are not satisfied. Another interesting property\ncontrasting it from quantum mechanics is that the subset of \"classically\ncorrelated states,\" i.e.\\ the states with only classical correlations, does not\nreproduce the classical world of two two-state systems.

In this work, we address two questions relevant\nfor the observation of sources characterized by AGN-like variability: what is\nthe most time-efficient way to detect such sources, and what is the\nobservational bias that can be introduced by the choice of the observing\nstrategy when conducting blind surveys of the sky. Different observing\nstrategies are evaluated using simulated light curves and realistic instrument\nresponse functions of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a future gamma-ray\nobservatory.

Under suitable conditions, simulations\nwith small-scale random forcing and large-scale drag exhibit a spontaneous\nformation of multiple zonal jets. The first hint of wave-like features is seen\nin the distribution of kinetic energy as a function of frequency; specifically,\nfor progressively larger deformation scales there are systematic departures in\nthe form of isolated peaks (at progressively higher frequencies) from a\npower-law scaling. Con- comitantly, there is an inverse flux of kinetic energy\nin frequency space which extends to lower frequencies for smaller deformation\nscales. The identification of these peaks as Rossby waves is made possible by\nexamining the energy spectrum in frequency-zonal wavenumber and\nfrequency-meridional wavenumber diagrams. In fact, the modified Rhines scale\nturns out to be a useful measure of the dominant meridional wavenumber of the\nmodulating Rossby waves; once this is fixed, apart from a spectral peak at the\norigin (the steady jet), almost all the energy is contained in westward\npropagating disturbances that follow the theoretical Rossby dispersion\nrelation. Quite consistently, noting that the zonal scale of the modulating\nwaves is restricted to the first few wavenumbers, the energy spectrum is almost\nentirely contained within the corresponding Rossby dispersion curves on a\nfrequency-meridional wavenumber diagram. Cases when jets do not form are also\nconsidered; once again, there is a hint of Rossby wave activity, though the\nspectral peaks are quite muted.

Each player is\nallocated a bundle that maximizes his profit according to this menu. We define\nthe taxation complexity of a truthful mechanism to be the logarithm of the\nmaximum number of menus that may be presented to a player.\n  Our main finding is that in general the taxation complexity essentially\nequals the communication complexity.

Indeed, the estimates one can obtain\nusing these critical-exponent norms appear to be the best possible when one\nneeds to bound the norm of a Green's operator for a Laplacian, depending on a\nconnection varying in a non-compact family, in terms of minimal data such as\nthe first positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian or the L^2 norm of the curvature\nof the connection. Following Taubes, we describe a collection of\ncritical-exponent Sobolev norms and general Green's operator estimates\ndepending only on first positive eigenvalues or the L^2 norm of the\nconnection's curvature. Such estimates are particularly useful in the gluing\nconstruction of solutions to non-linear partial differential equations\ndepending on a degenerating parameter, such as the approximate, reference\nsolution in the anti-self-dual or PU(2) monopole equations. We apply them here\nto prove an optimal slice theorem for the quotient space of connections. The\nresult is optimal in the sense that if a point [A] in the quotient space is\nknown to be just L^2_1-close enough to a reference point [A_0], then the\nconnection A can be placed in Coulomb gauge relative to the connection A_0,\nwith all constants depending at most on the first positive eigenvalue of the\ncovariant Laplacian defined by A_0 and the L^2 norm of the curvature of A_0. In\nthis paper we shall for simplicity only consider connections over\nfour-dimensional manifolds, but the methods and results can adapted to\nmanifolds of arbitrary dimension to prove slice theorems which apply when the\nreference connection is allowed to degenerate.\n","Comment: LaTeX 2e, 43 pages.
