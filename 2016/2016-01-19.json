This affords an\nimproved analysis over previous work by minimising the effects of cosmic\nvariance and allowing the cross-clustering analysis of LAEs and LBGs.

The mathematical expression of\nthis law resembles Newton's law of gravity, which explains its name. Another\npopular approach is inspired by the theory of intervening opportunities which\nargues that the distance has no effect on the destination choice, playing only\nthe role of a surrogate for the number of intervening opportunities between\nthem. In this paper, we perform a thorough comparison between these two\napproaches in their ability at estimating commuting flows by testing them\nagainst empirical trip data at different scales and coming from different\ncountries. Different versions of the gravity and the intervening opportunities\nlaws, including the recently proposed radiation law, are used to estimate the\nprobability that an individual has to commute from one unit to another, called\ntrip distribution law. Based on these probability distribution laws, the\ncommuting networks are simulated with different trip distribution models. We\nshow that the gravity law performs better than the intervening opportunities\nlaws to estimate the commuting flows, to preserve the structure of the network\nand to fit the commuting distance distribution although it fails at predicting\ncommuting flows at large distances.

However, in magnetic fusion devices, the\nopen magnetic field lines intersect the structural elements of the device with\nnear grazing incidence angles. The magnetic field tends to align the particle\nflow along its own field lines, thus counteracting the mechanism that leads to\nthe formation of the DS. Recent work using a fluid model [P. Stangeby, Nucl.\nFusion {\\bf 52}, 083012 (2012)] showed that the DS disappears when the\nincidence angle is smaller than a critical value (around $5^\\circ$ for\nITER-like parameters). Here, we study this transition by means of numerical\nsimulations of a kinetic model both in the collisionless and weakly collisional\nregimes. We show that the main features observed in the fluid model are\npreserved: for grazing incidence, the space charge density near the wall is\nreduced, the ion flow is subsonic, and the electric field and plasma density\nprofiles are spread out over several ion Larmor radii instead of a few Debye\nlengths as in the unmagnetized case. As there is no singularity at the DS\nentrance in the kinetic model, this phenomenon depends smoothly on the magnetic\nfield incidence angle and no particular critical angle arises. The simulation\nresults and the predictions of the fluid model are in good agreement, although\nsome discrepancies subsist, mainly due to the assumptions of isothermal closure\nand diagonality of the pressure tensor in the fluid model.\n"]}]

Simulations are analyzed to account for HI self-shielding and the presence\nof molecular hydrogen. We find that the mass in neutral hydrogen of dark matter\nhalos monotonically increases with the halo mass and can be well described by a\npower-law of the form $M_{\\rm HI}(M,z)\\propto M^{3/4}$. Our results point out\nthat AGN feedback reduces both the total halo mass and its HI mass, although it\nis more efficient in removing HI. We conclude that AGN feedback reduces the\nneutral hydrogen mass of a given halo by $\\sim50\\%$, with a weak dependence on\nhalo mass and redshift. The spatial distribution of neutral hydrogen within\nhalos is also affected by AGN feedback, whose effect is to decrease the\nfraction of HI that resides in the halo inner regions.

In this work, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field\ntheory calculations to analyze data from magnetization, elastic neutron\nscattering and specific heat measurements on Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.

The difference of power\nbetween the two statistics is negligible in models of demographic inference but\nsubstantial in an additional and purely statistical example.

In the quiz, students were either (1) asked to solve\nthe problem in which a partial diagram was provided or (2) explicitly asked to\ndraw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any instruction regarding\ndiagrams. Students in group (1), who were given the partial diagram, could not\nuse that partial diagram by itself to solve the problem. The partial diagram\nwas simply intended as a hint for students to complete the diagram and follow\nthe diagrammatic approach.

The obtained results provide evidence of a\npreviously unknown physical mechanism affecting the neutral species of some\nchemical elements in the atmosphere of most AGB stars: because of it, the\nabundances derived from neutral lines are systematically underestimated, while\nthose measured from ionized lines remain unaffected.

Earlier Marshall and Chapman developed a\nmulti-body formulation for such systems wherein the cluster partition function\nfor the hard-sphere solvent molecules in a defined inner-shell (or coordination\nvolume) of the hard-sphere solute is used as the reference within the\nstatistical association fluid theory formalism. The multi-body contribution to\nthese partition functions are obtained by ignoring the bulk solvent, thus\nlimiting the applicability of the theory to low system densities. Deriving\ninspiration from the quasichemical theory of solutions where these partition\nfunctions occur in the guise of equilibrium constants for cluster formation, we\ndevelop a way to account for the multi-body correlations including the effect\nof the bulk solvent. We obtain the free energy to evacuate the inner-shell, the\nchemistry contribution within quasichemical theory, from simulations of the\nhard-sphere reference. This chemistry contribution reflects association in the\nreference in the presence of the bulk medium. The gas-phase partition functions\nare then augmented by a mean activity factor that is adjusted to reproduce the\nchemistry contribution. We show that the updated partition function provides a\nrevised reference that better captures the distribution of solvent around the\nsolute up to high system densities. Using this updated reference, we find that\ntheory better describes both the bonding state and the excess chemical\npotential of the colloid in the physical system.\n"]}]

As most commonly only some of the kinetic parameters are measurable or\nprecisely known, parameter estimation techniques are applied to parametrize the\nmodel to experimental data. A main challenge for the parameter estimation is\nthe complexity of the parameter space, especially its high dimensionality and\nlocal minima.\n  Parameter estimation techniques consist of an objective function, measuring\nhow well a certain parameter set describes the experimental data, and an\noptimization algorithm that optimizes this objective function.

Likewise, the\nreverse order permutation R$_{n} (\\in P_{n})$=(n$-$1, n$-$2, n$-$3, n$-$4,\n...,0) has no adjacencies. We denote the set of permutations in P$_{n} $ with\nexactly k adjacencies with P$_{n} $(k). We study variations of adjacency. % A\ntransposition exchanges adjacent sublists; when one of the sublists is\nrestricted to be a prefix (suffix) then one obtains a prefix (suffix)\ntransposition. We call the operations: transpositions, prefix transpositions\nand suffix transpositions as block-moves. A particular type of adjacency and a\nparticular block-move are closely related. In this article we compute the\ncardinalities of P$_{n}$(k) i.e. $ \\forall_k \\mid $P$ _{n} $ (k) $ \\mid $ for\neach type of adjacency in $O(n^2)$ time. Given a particular adjacency and the\ncorresponding block-move, we show that $\\forall_{k} \\mid P_{n}(k)\\mid$ and the\nexpected number of moves to sort a permutation in P$_{n} $ are closely related.\nConsequently, we propose a model to estimate the expected number of moves to\nsort a permutation in P$_{n} $ with a block-move. We show the results for\nprefix transposition. Due to symmetry, these results are also applicable to\nsuffix transposition.\n","Comment: 20 pages. 5 tables"]}]

A fundamental problem on this model, with\napplications in the verification of stochastic systems, is to compute\ninformation about the distribution of the total cost accumulated in a run. This\nincludes the probability of large total costs, the median cost, and other\nquantiles. While expectations can be computed in polynomial time, previous work\nhas demonstrated that the computation of cost quantiles is harder but can be\ndone in PSPACE. In this paper we show that cost quantiles in cost Markov chains\ncan be computed in the counting hierarchy, thus providing evidence that\ncomputing those quantiles is likely not PSPACE-hard. We obtain this result by\nexhibiting a tight link to a problem in formal language theory: counting the\nnumber of words that are both accepted by a given automaton and have a given\nParikh image.

This approach reduces the problem to a k-medians\nproblem, for which the paper gives a new algorithm with a provably good\nperformance guarantee. In comparison to previous heuristics (First Fit, with\nand without generalized Lloyd's/k-means postprocessing steps), the new\nalgorithm generates a better codebook, resulting in an overall improvement in\ncompression performance of almost 17%.\n"]}]
