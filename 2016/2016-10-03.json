The difficult trajectory\nplanning problem is solved in two separate, simpler, steps: first, find a path\nin the configuration space that satisfies the geometric constraints (path\nplanning), and second, find a time-parameterization of that path satisfying the\nkinodynamic constraints. A fundamental requirement is that the path found in\nthe first step should be time-parameterizable.

The network is\noptimized by minimizing loss aggregated from all the units, which share model\nparameters while receiving different information to compute attention\nprobability. For training, our model attends to a region within image feature\nmap, updates its memory based on the question and attended image feature, and\nanswers the question based on its memory state. This procedure is performed to\ncompute loss in each step. The motivation of this approach is our observation\nthat multi-step inferences are often required to answer questions while each\nproblem may have a unique desirable number of steps, which is difficult to\nidentify in practice. Hence, we always make the first unit in the network solve\nproblems, but allow it to learn the knowledge from the rest of units by\nbackpropagation unless it degrades the model. To implement this idea, we\nearly-stop training each unit as soon as it starts to overfit. Note that, since\nmore complex models tend to overfit on easier questions quickly, the last\nanswering unit in the unfolded recurrent neural network is typically killed\nfirst while the first one remains last. We make a single-step prediction for a\nnew question using the shared model.

To satisfy\nthe constraint of uniform density, the superconducting state of the ladder is\nwritten as a linear combination of the allowed k-states of the tight-binding\nmodel with open boundaries. Above a critical value of the parameter t (ratio\nbetween the intra-rung and inter-rung Josephson couplings), the ladder\nspontaneously develop currents at the edges which spread to the bulk as t is\nincreased until complete coverage is reached. Above a certain value of t, which\nvaries with ladder size (t = 1 for an infinite-sized ladder), the edge currents\nare destroyed. The value t = 1 corresponds, in the tight-binding model, to the\nopening of a gap between two bands.

Based on the\nestablished -neuroscientifically sound- concepts of brainwave frequency bands,\nactivation asymmetry index and cross-frequency-coupling (CFC), we introduce a\nBrain Computer Interface (BCI) system that automatically assigns a rating score\nto the listened song. Our research operated in two distinct stages: i) a\ngeneric feature engineering stage, in which features from signal-analytics were\nranked and selected based on their ability to associate music induced\nperturbations in brainwaves with listener's appraisal of music. ii) a\npersonalization stage, during which the efficiency of ex- treme learning\nmachines (ELMs) is exploited so as to translate the derived pat- terns into a\nlistener's score. Encouraging experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the\nsystem, are presented.\n","Comment: 12th IFIP WG 12.5 International Conference and Workshops, AIAI 2016,\n  Thessaloniki, Greece, September 16-18, 2016, Proceedings"]}]

However, we can apply their line\nof proof only after some manipulation of the splitting sequence: a\nrearrangement, changing the order the elementary moves are performed in, so\nthat the ones producing Dehn twists are brought together; and then an\nuntwisting, which suppresses the majority of these latter moves to give a new\nsequence, which does not end with the same track as before, but does not\ninclude any portion that is almost stationary in the pants graph.
