While this matrix is usually Hermitian, it becomes\nnon-Hermitian in the presence of a quark chemical potential. We show how the\naction of the sign function of a non-Hermitian matrix on an arbitrary vector\ncan be computed efficiently on large lattices by an iterative method. A Krylov\nsubspace approximation based on the Arnoldi algorithm is described for the\nevaluation of a generic matrix function. The efficiency of the method is\nspoiled when the matrix has eigenvalues close to a function discontinuity. This\nis cured by adding a small number of critical eigenvectors to the Krylov\nsubspace, for which we propose two different deflation schemes. The ensuing\nmodified Arnoldi method is then applied to the sign function, which has a\ndiscontinuity along the imaginary axis. The numerical results clearly show the\nimproved efficiency of the method. Our modification is particularly effective\nwhen the action of the sign function of the same matrix has to be computed many\ntimes on different vectors, e.g., if the overlap Dirac operator is inverted\nusing an iterative method.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures; minor changes, as published in Comput.

Can the honest agents achieve rendezvous\nstarting from an arbitrary configuration in spite of the malicious agent? We\npresent some necessary conditions for solving rendezvous in spite of the\nmalicious agent in arbitrary networks. We then focus on the ring and mesh\ntopologies and provide algorithms to solve rendezvous. For ring networks, our\nalgorithms solve rendezvous in all feasible instances of the problem, while we\nshow that rendezvous is impossible for an even number of agents in unoriented\nrings. For the oriented mesh networks, we prove that the problem can be solved\nwhen the honest agents initially form a connected configuration without holes\nif and only if they can see which are the occupied nodes within a two-hops\ndistance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study such\na powerful and mobile fault model, in the context of mobile agents. Our model\nlies between the more powerful but static fault model of black holes (which can\neven destroy the agents), and the less powerful but mobile fault model of\nByzantine agents (which can only imitate the honest agents but can neither harm\nnor stop them).\n"]}]

We emphasize that the\ntime-averaged limit measure is symmetric for the origin, however, the weight\nfunction in the weak limit measure is asymmetric in general, which implies that\nthe weak convergence theorem represents the asymmetry of the probability\ndistribution. Furthermore, the weak limit measure heavily depends on the phase\nof the defect and initial state of the walker. Comparing with our previous\nstudies, we also show some numerical results of the probability distribution to\nconfirm that our result is relevant mathematically, and consider the effect of\nchanging the phase and initial coin state on the probability distribution, or\nthe ballistic spreading, which is one of the motivations of our study.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 12 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1412.4309"]}]

Recently, a local force density balance\nwas established for the 1s electron in the H atom, based on the energy-momentum\ntensor of the classical Dirac field. This methodology is now extended to\nquantum fields by considering the force densities acting on the vacuum\npolarization induced by a point charge. Such a model is applicable to any\ncharged particle at large distances, since the only vestige of its internal\nstructure is the electric Coulomb field together with the vacuum polarization\ninduced by it. While the polarization charge density is attracted to the point\ncharge, it is kept from collapsing by repulsive forces due to confinement and\ndegeneracy. It is shown analytically that the corresponding force densities are\nbalanced for every filled shell of mj states at a given angular momentum j. The\nforce densities are then summed over all single-electron states in the Dirac\nsea and renormalized by subtracting singular terms. In leading order of alpha,\nthe force densities remain balanced.

Thus, regulating translation in order to obtain a desired ribosomal\nprofile along the mRNA molecule is an important biological problem. We study\nthis problem using a model for mRNA translation, called the ribosome flow model\n(RFM). In the RFM, the mRNA molecule is modeled as chain of n sites. The n\nstate-variables describe the ribosomal density profile along the mRNA molecule,\nwhereas the transition rates from each site to the next are controlled by n+1\npositive constants. To study the problem of controlling the density profile, we\nconsider some or all of the transition rates as time-varying controls. We\nconsider the following problem: given an initial and a desired ribosomal\ndensity profile, determine the time-varying values of the transition rates that\nsteer the RFM to this density profile, if they exist.

Specifically, to illustrate how the performance results of\nan ad hoc network protocol drastically change as a result of changing the\nmobility model simulated. Location management is a fundamental problem in\npersonal communication services network. The current standard of location\nmanagement is HLR/VLR scheme. It has been observed that the performance of any\nlocation management scheme depends on space requirements, bandwidth\nrequirements and time requirements. To avoid certain drawbacks in HLR/VLR\nscheme, many approaches including hierarchical approaches have been suggested.\nWorking set idea is chosen to analyze its performance for location management\nin PCS networks. Due to inadequacy of standard network simulators to provide\nthe output in the format desired, a new location management simulator can be\nbuilt. Two variants of working set idea viz.

When the degree of the polynomial function is a Gold number,\nseveral partial results have been obtained [1, 7, 8, 10, 17]. One of the\nresults in this article is a proof of the relatively primeness of the\nmultivariate APN polynomial conjecture, in the Gold degree case. This helps us\nextend substantially previous results. We prove that Gold degree polynomials of\nthe form $x^{2^k+1}+h(x)$, where $deg(h)$ is any odd integer (with the natural\nexceptions), can not be exceptional APN.\n  We also show absolute irreducibility of several classes of multivariate\npolynomials over finite fields and discuss their applications.\n"]}]

The Transient Impact Model\n(TIM) posits that the price at high frequency time scales is a linear\ncombination of the signs of the past executed market orders, weighted by a\nso-called propagator function. An alternative description -- the History\nDependent Impact Model (HDIM) -- assumes that the deviation between the\nrealised order sign and its expected level impacts the price linearly and\npermanently.

Using Newtonian gravity, but adding the forces from the emission of\ngravitational waves, we solve the hydrodynamics equations using the smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics method. The microscopic properties of the neutron star\nmatter are described in terms of a new nuclear equation of state (EOS) based on\nthe tables of Shen et al. (1998). The effects of neutrino emission of all\nflavours are accounted for. The new EOS is noticeably stiffer than the\nLattimer-Swesty-EOS used in previous investigations. We find in general\nsomewhat lower temperatures than previous investigations. This allows a\nsubstantial fraction of heavy nuclei to be present even in the inner parts of\nthe torus that forms around the central object and yields important\ncontributions to the neutrino opacity. The central object shows a rapid\ndifferential rotation with periods of $\\sim$ 2ms, which we suspect to stabilize\nthe central object on (at least) the simulation time scale against\ngravitational collapse. The differential rotation could wind up initial\nmagnetic fields to $\\sim 10^17$ G.\n","Comment: numerical viscosity measured, vertical disk structure investigated,\n  comparison with Lattimer-Swesty EOS; MNRAS in press; movies under\n  http://www.star.le.ac.uk/~sro/"]}]
