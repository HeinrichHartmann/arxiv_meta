Consequently, the\nhierarchy of cumulant equations is not closed. But because atmospheric flows\nare inhomogeneous and anisotropic, the nonlinearity may manifest itself only\nweakly through interactions of mean fields with disturbances such as thermals\nor eddies. In such situations, truncations of the hierarchy of cumulant\nequations hold promise as a closure strategy.\n  We review how truncations at second order can be used to model and elucidate\nthe dynamics of atmospheric flows. Two examples are considered. First, we study\nthe growth of a dry convective boundary layer, which is heated from below,\nleading to turbulent upward energy transport and growth of the boundary layer.\nWe demonstrate that a quasilinear truncation of the equations of motion, in\nwhich interactions of disturbances among each other are neglected but\ninteractions with mean fields are taken into account, can capture the growth of\nthe convective boundary layer even if it does not capture important turbulent\ntransport terms. Second, we study the evolution of two-dimensional large-scale\nwaves representing waves in Earth's upper atmosphere. We demonstrate that a\ncumulant expansion truncated at second order (CE2) can capture the evolution of\nsuch waves and their nonlinear interaction with the mean flow in some\ncircumstances, for example, when the wave amplitude is small enough or the\nplanetary rotation rate is large enough. However, CE2 fails to capture the flow\nevolution when nonlinear eddy--eddy interactions in surf zones become\nimportant. Higher-order closures can capture these missing interactions.\n  The results point to new ways in which the dynamics of turbulent boundary\nlayers may be represented in climate models, and they illustrate different\nclasses of nonlinear processes that can control wave dissipation and momentum\nfluxes in the troposphere.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in the New Journal of\n  Physics"]}]

We also give additional convergence results for when the\nsub-sampled Hessian is regularized by modifying its spectrum or Levenberg-type\nregularization.\n  Finally, in addition to Hessian sub-sampling, we consider sub-sampling the\ngradient as way to further reduce the computational complexity per iteration.\nWe use approximate matrix multiplication results from randomized numerical\nlinear algebra (RandNLA) to obtain the proper sampling strategy and we\nestablish locally R-linear convergence rates. In such a setting, we also show\nthat a very aggressive sample size increase results in a R-superlinearly\nconvergent algorithm.\n  While the sample size depends on the condition number of the problem, our\nconvergence rates are problem-independent, i.e., they do not depend on the\nquantities related to the problem. Hence, our analysis here can be used to\ncomplement the results of our basic framework from the companion paper, [38],\nby exploring algorithmic trade-offs that are important in practice.\n"]}]

To take advantage\nof this symmetry element, we decided to represent RSPs using cylindrical\ncoordinates, (rho, theta, z), with the z-axis as the main axis, and one tip of\nthe protein at the origin. A \"tip\" is one of two extreme points in the protein\nlying along the protein axis along its longest dimension.

We found only finitely many minimal\nnon unit disk graphs in the literature. In this paper we study in a systematic\nway forbidden induced subgraphs for the class of unit disk graphs. We develop\nseveral structural and geometrical tools, and use them to reveal infinitely\nmany new minimal non unit disk graphs. Further we use these results to\ninvestigate structure of co-bipartite unit disk graphs. In particular, we give\nstructural characterization of those co-bipartite unit disk graphs whose edges\nbetween parts form a C4-free bipartite graph, and show that bipartite\ncomplements of these graphs are also unit disk graphs. Our results lead us to\npropose a conjecture that the class of co-bipartite unit disk graphs is closed\nunder bipartite complementation.\n"]}]

However, previous calibrations of the LPPLS model\nhave shown that the estimation of $t_c$ is in general quite unstable.

This\nprovides a rigorous interval estimation for the critical time, rather than a\npoint estimation in previous approaches.

Diffuse non-thermal emission has been\nobserved in a number of cool core clusters in the form of a radio mini-halo\nsurrounding the radio-loud BCG on scales comparable to that of the cooling\nregion. This contribution outlines the main points covered by the talk on these\ntopics. In particular, after summarizing the cooling flow regulation by AGN\nheating and the non-thermal emission from cool core clusters, we present a\nrecent study of the largest collection of known mini-halo clusters (~ 20\nobjects) which investigated the scenario of a common origin of radio mini-halos\nand gas heating. We further discuss the prospects offered by future radio\nsurveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) for building large (>> 100\nobjects), unbiased mini-halo samples while probing at the same time the\npresence of radio-AGN feedback in the host clusters.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures.

Although the mucosa recovers during breaks of and\nfollowing the radiotherapy course the recovery will depend on the type of\ntissue involved and on its location.

The model allows to test whether sensitivity\ndiffers by mouth sites after having adjusted for site specific cumulative\nradiation dose.

We fit the model to longitudinal\npatient data from a prospective observation and find that after adjusting for\ncumulative dose, upper, lower lips and mouth floor are associated with the\nlowest mucositis scores and hard and soft palate are associated with the\nhighest mucositis scores.

As initial conditions for\nthe spatial distribution of HII regions, gas, and dust, we take three Milky\nWay-like galaxies from state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations\nthat implement different prescriptions for star formation, feedback, and\nchemical enrichment. Radiative transfer has been solved a posteriori, using the\npublicly-available Monte Carlo code Sunrise to take into account dust\nabsorption and scattering of the H-alpha photons, originating exclusively from\nthe HII regions. No contribution from recombinations in the diffuse ionized gas\n(DIG) component is explicitly or implicitly included in our model. Our main\nresult is that the flux arising from scattered light is of the order of 1-2 per\ncent of the H-alpha flux coming directly from the HII regions.

We\nwill then briefly discuss how such a \"quadratic curvature action\" can be\ndecomposed in a covariant formalism into separate sectors involving the tensor,\nvector and scalar modes of the metric tensor; most of the details of the\nanalysis however, will be presented in an accompanying paper. We will find that\nonly the transverse and trace-less spin-2 graviton with its two helicity states\nand possibly a spin-0 Brans-Dicke type scalar degree of freedom are left to\npropagate in 4 dimensions.

Using precision measurements of tracer particle trajectories in a\ntwo-dimensional fluid flow producing chaotic mixing, we directly measure the\ntime-dependent stretching and compression fields. These quantities, previously\navailable only numerically, attain local maxima along lines coinciding with the\nstable and unstable manifolds, thus revealing the dynamical structures that\ncontrol mixing.
