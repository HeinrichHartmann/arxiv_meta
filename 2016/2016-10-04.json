The golden standard typically is the behavior of learning dynamics in\npotential games, where many evolutionary dynamics, e.g., replicator, are known\nto converge to sets of equilibria. Even in such classic settings many critical\nquestions remain unanswered. We examine issues such as:\n  Point-wise convergence: Does the system actually equilibrate even in the\npresence of continuums of equilibria?\n  Computing regions of attraction: Given point-wise convergence can we compute\nthe region of asymptotic stability of each equilibrium (e.g., estimate its\nvolume, geometry)?\n  System invariants: Invariant functions remain constant along every system\ntrajectory. This notion is orthogonal to the game theoretic concept of a\npotential function, which always strictly increases/decreases along system\ntrajectories. Do dynamics in potential games exhibit invariant functions? If\nso, how many? How do these functions look like?\n  Based on these geometric characterizations, we propose a novel quantitative\nframework for analyzing the efficiency of potential games with many equilibria.\nThe predictions of different equilibria are weighted by their probability to\narise under evolutionary dynamics given uniformly random initial conditions.\nThis average case analysis is shown to offer novel insights in classic game\ntheoretic challenges, including quantifying the risk dominance in stag-hunt\ngames and allowing for more nuanced performance analysis in networked\ncoordination and congestion games with large gaps between price of stability\nand price of anarchy.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The identification of such strategies is typically based\non a mathematical model of the process to be altered through targeted control\ninputs. This paper focuses on processes at the molecular level that determine\nthe state of an individual cell, involving signaling or gene regulation. The\nmathematical model type considered is that of Boolean networks. The potential\ncontrol targets can be represented by a set of nodes and edges that can be\nmanipulated to produce a desired effect on the system. Experimentally, node\nmanipulation requires technology to completely repress or fully activate a\nparticular gene product while edge manipulations only require a drug that\ninactivates the interaction between two gene products. Results: This paper\npresents a method for the identification of potential intervention targets in\nBoolean molecular network models using algebraic techniques. The approach\nexploits an algebraic representation of Boolean networks to encode the control\ncandidates in the network wiring diagram as the solutions of a system of\npolynomials equations, and then uses computational algebra techniques to find\nsuch controllers.

Using the OSIRIS spectrograph at the\n10-m GTC telescope, we perform spectro-photometric differential observations,\nwhich allow us to both calculate a high-accuracy photometric light curve, and a\nstudy of the color-dependence of the transit.

After careful data\nanalysis, we find that the previously reported asymmetry is not present in\neither of two transits, observed in July 2014 and July 2015 with high\nphotometric precisions of 300ppm over 5 minutes. Due to the relative faintness\nof the star, we do not reach the precision necessary to perform transmission\nspectroscopy of its atmosphere, but we see no signs of color-dependency of the\ntransit depth or duration.

Following this trend, this paper\naddresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently\ndeveloped opinion mining techniques.

Vibrational mismatch at the interface leads to this interfacial\nthermal resistance, which plays an important role in energy transfer at the\nboundary. Negligible work has been reported on the influence of CNT diameter on\nthe resistance through the vibrational mismatch study. Molecular dynamics\nsimulations have been performed to investigate the effect of CNT diameter on\ninterfacial resistance between carbon nanotube (CNT) and water molecules. This\nwork is an effort to understand the heat transfer phenomenon at the interface\nby quantifying the vibrational mismatch. Analysis of the vibrational spectra of\nCNT and water molecules is done to study the effect of CNT diameter on\ninterfacial resistance. Starting with the initial configuration, and\nequilibrating the system of CNT and water molecules at 300 K and 1 atm, the CNT\ntemperature is raised to 700 K by velocity rescaling. This system is now\nallowed to relax as a micro-canonical ensemble. Based on the lumped capacitance\nanalysis, the time constant of the CNT temperature response is determined,\nwhich is then used to compute the interfacial thermal resistance. The\ninterfacial thermal resistance is observed to be relatively higher for the\nlarger diameter nanotube. This is attributed to the higher vibrational mismatch\nexisting for larger diameter CNT as a result of low overlapping region between\nvibrational density states of CNT and water molecules. For smaller diameter\nCNT, the interfacial thermal resistance is low which results in the efficient\nheat transfer at the interface thus, emphasizing the indispensable role of\nlarger diameter CNTs in the cooling applications.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures, Molecular dynamics simulation performed using\n  LAMMPS"]}]

Both types of generalization are commonly used in the literature.\nFor instance, generalization in expectation has been used to analyze\nalgorithms, such as ridge regression and SGD, whereas generalization in\nprobability is used in the VC theory, among others.

These metrics are\nsolutions of Einstein's gravity minimally coupled to a massive, complex scalar\nfield. They form a continuous bridge between a subset of Kerr black holes and a\nfamily of rotating boson stars depending on one extra parameter, the\ndimensionless scalar hair parameter $q$, ranging from 0 (Kerr black holes) to 1\n(boson stars). Here we study the limiting case $q=1$, corresponding to rotating\nboson stars. For comparison, spherical boson stars are also considered. We\nsimulate observations with XIS/Suzaku. Using the fact that current observations\nare well fit by the Kerr solution and thus requiring that acceptable\nalternative compact objects must be compatible with a Kerr fit, we find that\nsome boson star solutions are relatively easy to rule out as potential\ncandidates to explain astrophysical black holes, while other solutions, which\nare neither too dilute nor too compact are more elusive and we argue that they\ncannot be distinguished from Kerr black holes by the analysis of the iron line\nwith current X-ray facilities.\n","Comment: 1+18 pages, 9 figures. v2: refereed version"]}]

Here we investigate this model in the realm of evolutionary\nsocial dilemmas on the square lattice and scale-free networks. By using the\nmaster equation and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that cooperators coexist\nwith defectors in the whole phase diagram, even at high temptations to defect.\nWe study the microscopic mechanism that is responsible for the striking\npersistence of cooperative behavior and find that cooperation spreads through\nsecond-order neighbors, rather than by means of network reciprocity that\ndominates in imitation-based models. For the square lattice the master equation\ncan be solved analytically in the large temperature limit of the Fermi\nfunction, while for other cases the resulting differential equations must be\nsolved numerically. Either way, we find good qualitative agreement with the\nMonte Carlo simulation results. Our analysis also reveals that the evolutionary\noutcomes are to a large degree independent of the network topology, including\nthe number of neighbors that are considered for payoff determination on\nlattices, which further corroborates the local character of the microscopic\ndynamics.

This marks the onset of a region\nof bistability between a high amplitude oscillatory rhythm and a background\nstate. Near the bistability, the model has excitable dynamics, showing\nprolonged rhythmic transients in response to suprathreshold pulse stimulation.\nWe analyse the state space geometry of the bistable and the excitable state,\nand find that the rhythmic transient arises when the impending FoC bifurcation\ndeforms the state space and creates an area of locally reduced attraction to\nthe fixed point. This area allows trajectories to dwell in it for before\nescaping to the stable steady state, thus creating rhythmic transients. In the\nfull thalamo-cortical model, we find a similar FoC bifurcation structure. In\naddition, the (fast) cortical subsystem can undergo a supercritical\nAndronov-Hopf bifurcation to fast spiking.

Recently,\nthere has been proposed a large number of new applications in fields such as\nrobotics, machine learning, experimental design, simulation, etc. In this\npaper, we focus on several problems that appear in robotics and autonomous\nsystems: algorithm tuning, automatic control and intelligent design. All those\nproblems can be mapped to global optimization problems. However, they become\nhard optimization problems. Bayesian optimization internally uses a\nprobabilistic surrogate model (e.g.: Gaussian process) to learn from the\nprocess and reduce the number of samples required. In order to generalize to\nunknown functions in a black-box fashion, the common assumption is that the\nunderlying function can be modeled with a stationary process. Nonstationary\nGaussian process regression cannot generalize easily and it typically requires\nprior knowledge of the function. Some works have designed techniques to\ngeneralize Bayesian optimization to nonstationary functions in an indirect way,\nbut using techniques originally designed for regression, where the objective is\nto improve the quality of the surrogate model everywhere. Instead optimization\nshould focus on improving the surrogate model near the optimum. In this paper,\nwe present a novel kernel function specially designed for Bayesian\noptimization, that allows nonstationary behavior of the surrogate model in an\nadaptive local region. In our experiments, we found that this new kernel\nresults in an improved local search (exploitation), without penalizing the\nglobal search (exploration).

Based on this observation, a new approach for\nshrinking the sparse codes is presented in this paper. To effectively shrink\nthe sparse codes in the rain and non-rain regions, an error map between the\ninput rain image and the reconstructed rain image is generated by using the\nlearned rain dictionary.

Here we\nstudy by Monte Carlo simulations a coarse-grained model for bulk water that\nincludes many-body interactions associated to water cooperativity. The model is\nefficient and allows us to equilibrate water at extreme low temperatures in a\nwide range of pressures. We find the line of temperatures of maximum density at\nconstant pressure and, at low temperature and high pressure, a phase transition\nbetween high-density liquid and low-density liquid phases. The liquid-liquid\nphase transition ends in a critical point. In the supercritical liquid region\nwe find for each thermodynamic response function a locus of weak maxima at high\ntemperature and a locus of strong maxima at low temperature, with both loci\nconverging at the liquid-liquid critical point where they diverge. Comparing\nour results with previous works for the phase diagram of a many-body water\nmonolayer, we observe that the weak maxima of the specific heat are less\nevident in bulk and appear only at negative pressures, while we find those of\ncompressibility and thermal expansion coefficient also at positive pressures in\nbulk.

A fraction of the AGN luminosity is absorbed by the\ndusty torus and is re-radiated in the infrared (IR) band. Thus the fraction of\nthe sky covered by the torus as seen from the central source, known as the\ncovering factor f_c, can be obtained from the ratio of the IR to the bolometric\nluminosities of the source. However, because of the uncertainty in determining\nbolometric luminosities, the estimation of covering factors has proven\ndifficult, especially in the local Universe where the peak of the observed\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) lie in the ultraviolet. In this work, we\ndetermine the covering factors of an X-ray/optically selected sample of 51 type\n1 AGN analysed by Jin et al. The bolometric luminosities of these sources can\nbe derived using a self-consistent, energy-conserving model that estimates the\ncontribution in the unobservable far-UV region. We have computed the IR and\nbolometric luminosities by analysing the broadband SEDs of the sample using\ndata from SDSS, XMM-Newton, WISE, 2MASS and UKIDSS. The derived covering\nfraction for the torus ranges from ~0.02 to ~0.88 with a mean value of ~0.3 and\na dispersion of about 0.17. We also find that f_c is anti-correlated with the\nbolometric luminosity and the Eddington ratio. Simulations suggest that the\nEddington ratio is the underlying driver of torus covering factor rather than\nbolometric luminosity. This points to a changing geometry of the accretion flow\nconnected to Eddington ratio rather than a receding torus driven solely by\nillumination.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

Using a modified\nformulation of Floquet theory, treating the time-dependent magnetic field as a\nperturbation, and exploiting the slow radical pair recombination, we show that\none can obtain a good approximation to the product yield by considering only\nnearly-degenerate sub-spaces of the Floquet space. Within a significant\nparameter range, the resulting method is found to give product yields in good\nagreement with exact quantum mechanical results for a variety of simple model\nradical pairs. Moreover it is considerably more efficient than the exact\ncalculation, and it can be applied to radical pairs containing significantly\nmore nuclear spins.

From the algorithmic view point, executing\nexisting linear algorithms in information retrieval and machine learning on\nsuch tremendous amounts of data incur intolerable computational and storage\ncosts. To address this issue, there is a growing interest to map data points in\nlarge-scale datasets to binary codes. This can significantly reduce the storage\ncomplexity of large-scale datasets. However, one of the most compelling reasons\nfor using binary codes or any discrete representation is that they can be used\nas direct indices into a hash table. Incorporating hash table offers fast query\nexecution; one can look up the nearby buckets in a hash table populated with\nbinary codes to retrieve similar items. Nonetheless, if binary codes are\ncompared in terms of the cosine similarity rather than the Hamming distance,\nthere is no fast exact sequential procedure to find the $K$ closest items to\nthe query other than the exhaustive search. Given a large dataset of binary\ncodes and a binary query, the problem that we address is to efficiently find\n$K$ closest codes in the dataset that yield the largest cosine similarities to\nthe query. To handle this issue, we first elaborate on the relation between the\nHamming distance and the cosine similarity. This allows finding the sequence of\nbuckets to check in the hash table.

However, tensor network\nrepresentations may be vulnerable to instabilities caused by small\nperturbations of the local tensor, especially when the local tensor is not\ninjective. For example, the topological order in tensor network representations\nof the toric code ground state has been shown to be unstable under certain\nsmall variations of the local tensor, if these small variations do not obey a\nlocal $Z_2$ symmetry of the tensor. In this paper, we ask the questions of\nwhether other types of topological orders suffer from similar kinds of\ninstability and if so, what is the underlying physical mechanism and whether we\ncan protect the order by enforcing certain symmetries on the tensor. We answer\nthese questions by showing that the tensor network representation of all\nstring-net models are indeed unstable, but the matrix product operator (MPO)\nsymmetries of the local tensor can help to protect the order. We find that,\n`stand-alone' variations that break the MPO symmetries lead to instability\nbecause they induce the condensation of bosonic quasi-particles and destroy the\ntopological order in the system. Therefore, such variations must be forbidden\nfor the encoded topological order to be reliably extracted from the local\ntensor.

We\ndiscuss mirror symmetry for stacks, using Morrison-Plesser-Hori-Vafa techniques\nto compute mirrors explicitly, and also find a natural generalization of\nBatyrev's mirror conjecture. In the process of studying mirror symmetry, we\nfind some new abstract CFT's, involving fields valued in roots of unity.\n","Comment: 43 pages, LaTeX, 3 figures; v2: typos fixed"]}]

On the\n(2,2) locus, correlation functions in the B model receive no quantum\ncorrections, but off the (2,2) locus, that can change. Classically, the (0,2)\nanalogue of the B model is equivalent to the previously-discussed (0,2)\nanalogue of the A model, but with the gauge bundle dualized -- our\ngeneralization of the A model, also simultaneously generalizes the B model. The\nA and B analogues sometimes have different regularizations, however, which\ndistinguish them quantum-mechanically. We discuss how properties of the (2,2) B\nmodel, such as the lack of quantum corrections, are realized in (0,2) A model\nlanguage. In an appendix, we also extensively discuss how the Calabi-Yau\ncondition for the closed string B model (uncoupled to topological gravity) can\nbe weakened slightly, a detail which does not seem to have been covered in the\nliterature previously. That weakening also manifests in the description of the\n(2,2) B model as a (0,2) A model.\n","Comment: 36 pages, LaTeX, no figures"]}]

The traditional construction of heterotic strings builds\neach E8 via a Spin(16)/Z2 subgroup, typically realized as a current algebra by\nleft-moving fermions, and as a result, only E8 gauge fields reducible to\nSpin(16)/Z2 gauge fields are directly realizable in standard constructions.\nHowever, there exist perturbatively consistent E8 gauge fields which can not be\nreduced to Spin(16)/Z2, and so cannot be described within standard heterotic\nworldsheet constructions.

To answer this\nquestion, we first show how each ten-dimensional E8 partition function can be\nbuilt up using other subgroups than Spin(16)/Z2, then construct ``fibered WZW\nmodels'' which allow us to explicitly couple current algebras for general\ngroups and general levels to heterotic strings.
