Which configurations are gatherable and how to gather all of them\ndeterministically by the same algorithm?\n  We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks.\nWe characterize all gatherable configurations and give two universal\ndeterministic gathering algorithms, i.e., algorithms that gather all gatherable\nconfigurations.

Using the same\nmethods, we show that the contact connected sum decomposition for tight contact\nstructures in dimension three does not extend to higher dimensions: in\nparticular, we exhibit connected sums of manifolds of dimension at least five\nwith Stein fillable contact structures that do not arise as contact connected\nsums.

Our\nresults imply that a scaling behavior of macroscopic thermodynamic quantities\nis not necessarily a signature for an underlying second-order phase transition\nand that the paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition proceeds, very\nlikely, in the presence of at least two long spatial scales: the correlation\nlength and the size of magnetic domains.\n","Comment: 10 pages, added figure 1, rearranged sections"]}]

It is explicitly shown that an accelerated charge,\ntaken to be a sphere of vanishingly small radius $r_{\\rm o} $, experiences at\nany time a self-force proportional to the acceleration it had at a time $r_{\\rm\no} /c$ earlier, while the rate of work done on the charge is obtained by a\nscalar product of the self-force with the instantaneous (present) value of its\nvelocity.

We then design a recursive protocol, wherein a\nbranching sequence of probabilistic filters increase the probability of success\nwhile reaching maximum fidelity at each iteration.

The benefits of this\nconstruction are illustrated in a number of applications to phase estimation,\nquantum cloning, coherent state amplification, and ancilla-driven computation.\nFinally, we extend our results to transitions where the input state is\ngenerally mixed and we apply our findings to the task of purifying quantum\ncoherence.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 9 figures; new results added"]}]

We also present a\nsimple construction of a measure for which conditional measure is not\ncomputable. Such measures were first constructed by N. Ackerman, C. Freer and\nD. Roy in [Proceedings of the 26th Annual IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer\nScience (LICS), pp. 107-116. IEEE (2011)].\n"]}]

The key idea of our\ntechnique, named Deformation Lamps, is to project only dynamic luminance\ninformation, which effectively activates the motion (and shape) processing in\nthe visual system, while preserving the color and texture of the original\nobject. Although the projected dynamic luminance information is spatially\ninconsistent with the color and texture of the target object, the observer's\nbrain automatically com- bines these sensory signals in such a way as to\ncorrect the inconsistency across visual attributes. We conducted a\npsychophysical experiment to investigate the characteristics of the\ninconsistency correction, and found that the correction was dependent\ncritically on the retinal magnitude of inconsistency. Another experiment showed\nthat perceived magnitude of image deformation by our techniques was\nunderestimated. The results ruled out the possibility that the effect by our\ntechnique stemmed simply from the physical change of object appearance by light\nprojection.

Unlike quantum Hall(QH) edge modes which\noccur at high magnetic fields in 2DEGs, the occurrence of QSH edge modes is\nbecause of spin-orbit scattering in the bulk of the material. These QSH edge\nmodes are spin dependent and chiral- opposite spins move in opposing\ndirections. Electronic spin has larger decoherence and relaxation time than\ncharge- in view of this its expected that QSH edge modes will be more robust to\ndisorder and inelastic scattering than QH edge modes which are charge dependent\nand spin unpolarized. However, we notice no such advantage accrues to QSH edge\nmodes when subjected to same degree of contact disorder and/or inelastic\nscattering in similar setups as QH edge modes. In fact we observe that QSH edge\nmodes are more susceptible to inelastic scattering and contact disorder than QH\nedge modes. Further, while a single disordered contact has no effect on QH edge\nmodes it leads to a finite charge Hall current in case of quantum spin Hall\nedge modes and thus vanishing of pure quantum spin Hall effect. For more than a\nsingle disordered contact while quantum Hall states continue to remain immune\nto disorder, quantum spin Hall edge modes become more susceptible- the Hall\nresistance for quantum spin Hall effect changes sign with increasing disorder.\nIn case of many disordered contacts with inelastic scattering included while\nquantization of Hall edge modes holds, for quantum spin Hall edge modes- a\nfinite charge Hall current still flows. For quantum spin Hall edge modes in the\ninelastic scattering regime we distinguish between two cases: with spin-flip\nand without spin-flip scattering. Finally, while asymmetry in sample geometry\ncan have a deleterious effect on quantum spin Hall case it has no impact in\nquantum Hall case.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, Accepted for publication in J.

This includes the first Keck Array observations at 95 GHz. The maps\nreach a depth of 50 nK deg in Stokes $Q$ and $U$ in the 150 GHz band and 127 nK\ndeg in the 95 GHz band. We take auto- and cross-spectra between these maps and\npublicly available maps from WMAP and Planck at frequencies from 23 GHz to 353\nGHz. An excess over lensed-LCDM is detected at modest significance in the\n95x150 $BB$ spectrum, and is consistent with the dust contribution expected\nfrom our previous work. No significant evidence for synchrotron emission is\nfound in spectra such as 23x95, or for correlation between the dust and\nsynchrotron sky patterns in spectra such as 23x353. We take the likelihood of\nall the spectra for a multi-component model including lensed-LCDM, dust,\nsynchrotron and a possible contribution from inflationary gravitational waves\n(as parametrized by the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$), using priors on the\nfrequency spectral behaviors of dust and synchrotron emission from previous\nanalyses of WMAP and Planck data in other regions of the sky. This analysis\nyields an upper limit $r_{0.05}<0.09$ at 95% confidence, which is robust to\nvariations explored in analysis and priors. Combining these $B$-mode results\nwith the (more model-dependent) constraints from Planck analysis of CMB\ntemperature plus BAO and other data, yields a combined limit $r_{0.05}<0.07$ at\n95% confidence.

In this paper, we investigate the structural origins of binding\naffinity and allosteric cooperativity of binding two calcium ions to each\ndomain of calmodulin (CaM) through simulations of a simple coarse-grained\nmodel. In this model, the protein's conformational transitions between open and\nclosed conformational ensembles are simulated explicitly and ligand binding and\nunbinding is treated implicitly within the Grand Canonical Ensemble.

The classic\nMonod-Wyman-Changeux model of allostery with appropriate binding free energy to\nthe open and closed ensembles accurately describes the simulated binding\nthermodynamics. The simulations predict that the two domains of CaM have\ndistinct binding affinity and cooperativity. In particular, C-terminal domain\nbinds calcium with higher affinity and greater cooperativity than the\nN-terminal domain. From a structural point of view, the affinity of an\nindividual binding loop depends sensitively on the loop's structural\ncompatibility with the ligand in the bound ensemble, as well as the\nconformational flexibility of the binding site in the unbound ensemble.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures; supplemental information: 2 pages, 2 figures"]}]

We analytically investigate the\ngeneralizability and robustness properties granted by the use of defensive\ndistillation when training DNNs.

The study\nshows that defensive distillation can reduce effectiveness of sample creation\nfrom 95% to less than 0.5% on a studied DNN. Such dramatic gains can be\nexplained by the fact that distillation leads gradients used in adversarial\nsample creation to be reduced by a factor of 10^30.

[Journal of Chemical Physics, accepted (2016)]),\nwe have introduced two key new elements into the method: a formalism for\nconverging the basis and for efficient pruning by use of the biorthogonal\nbasis. In this paper we review the key components of the theory and then\npresent new, efficient and parallelizable iterative algorithms for solving the\ntime-independent and time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger equations. The algorithms\ndynamically determine the active reduced basis iteratively without resorting to\nclassical analogs. These algorithmic developments, combined with the previous\nformal developments, allow quantum dynamics to be performed directly and\neconomically in phase space. We provide two illustrative examples: double-well\ntunneling and double ionization of helium.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1603.03962"]}]

(ii) It predicts that after a steep rising there will\nbe a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process.

Here we\npresent an integrated model - including local and global transport and the\nkinetics of oligomerization - for passive and active symplastic loading. We\nalso propose a physical model of transport through the plasmodesmata. With\nthese models, we predict that: 1) relative to passive loading, oligomerization\nof sucrose in the phloem, even in the absence of segregation, lowers the sugar\ncontent in the leaf required to achieve a given export rate and accelerates\nexport for a given concentration of sucrose in the mesophyll; and 2)\nsegregation of oligomers and the inverted gradient of total sugar content can\nbe achieved for physiologically reasonable parameter values, but even higher\nexport rates can be accessed in scenarios in which polymers are allowed to\ndiffuse back into the mesophyll. We discuss these predictions in relation to\nfurther studies aimed at the clarification of loading mechanisms, fitness of\nactive and passive symplastic loading, and potential targets for engineering\nimproved rates of export.\n"]}]

It is based on an Abelian-Higgs-type duality mapping of phonons onto\ngauge bosons (\"stress photons\"), which encode for the capacity of the crystal\nto propagate stresses.

Spectra of absorbed, saturated lines of\nquasars obeying Karlsson's law mainly result from interactions of natural,\nthermal light radiated by quasar with relatively cold, low presure atomic\nhydrogen. These lines are produced by three processes: a) A conventional\nabsorption in a relatively cold gas produces a set of lines; b) These lines are\nmultiplied by absorption after fundamental 3K or 4K redshifts, where K is\nKarlsson's constant: Spectra show that redshifts 3K (or 4K) exactly bring\nabsorbed Lyman beta (or gamma) line on Lyman alpha: redshift almost disappears,\nand gas lines are intensely absorbed in the absence of alpha absorption; c)\nRedshifts occur in regions where light at alpha frequency is poorly absorbed\ndue to permanent redshift, except when excitation of hydrogen to 2P level is\nsufficient for a superradiant flash emission at alpha frequency. This causes an\nintense absorption of high radiance rays from quasar, so the absorption of a\nline at current Lyman alpha frequency. Lightning and pumping produce relaxation\noscillations that write many absorption lines. Redshifts by H atoms in 2P\nlevels are due to parametric interactions composed of Impulsive Stimulated\nRaman Scatterings (ISRS): excited hydrogen atoms catalyze energy exchanges\nbetween observed ray and background cold thermal radiation, in agreement with\nthermodynamics.
