Precise detection of the GRB polarization\ncarried out by dedicated instruments can provide new data and be an ultimate\ntool to unveil their real nature. A novel space-borne Compton polarimeter POLAR\nonboard the Chinese space station TG2 is designed to measure linear\npolarization of gamma-rays arriving from GRB prompt emissions. POLAR uses\nplastics scintillator bars (PS) as gamma-ray detectors and multi-anode\nphotomultipliers (MAPMTs) for readout of the scintillation light. Inherent\nproperties of such detection systems are crosstalk and non-uniformity. The\ncrosstalk smears recorded energy over multiple channels making both\nnon-uniformity corrections and energy calibration more difficult. Rigorous\nextraction of polarization observable requires to take such effects properly\ninto account. We studied influence of the crosstalk on energy depositions\nduring laboratory measurements with X-ray beams. A relation between genuine and\nrecorded energy was deduced using an introduced model of data analysis. It\npostulates that both the crosstalk and non-uniformities can be described with a\nsingle matrix obtained in calibrations with mono-energetic X- and gamma-rays.\nNecessary corrections are introduced using matrix based equations allowing for\nproper evaluation of the measured GRB spectra.

With an eye towards true end-to-end\nlearning, we suggest learning the applied transformations on a per-class basis.\nParticularly, we align image pairs within each class under the assumption that\nthe spatial transformation between images belongs to a large class of\ndiffeomorphisms. We then learn a class-specific probabilistic generative models\nof the transformations in a Riemannian submanifold of the Lie group of\ndiffeomorphisms.

One major challenge inevitably\nmet when trying to infer the existence of one or more subclasses is the time\nconsuming, and subjective, process of subclass definition. In this work, we\nshow how machine learning tools facilitate identification of subtypes of SNeIa\nthrough the establishment of a hierarchical group structure in the continuous\nspace of spectral diversity formed by these objects. Using Deep Learning, we\nwere capable of performing such identification in a 4 dimensional feature space\n(+1 for time evolution), while the standard Principal Component Analysis barely\nachieves similar results using 15 principal components. This is evidence that\nthe progenitor system and the explosion mechanism can be described by a small\nnumber of initial physical parameters. As a proof of concept, we show that our\nresults are in close agreement with a previously suggested classification\nscheme and that our proposed method can grasp the main spectral features behind\nthe definition of such subtypes. This allows the confirmation of the velocity\nof lines as a first order effect in the determination of SNIa subtypes,\nfollowed by 91bg-like events.

In\na previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated\ngenotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of\ninterrelated idiotypes (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does\nnot cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study\nof quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the\nconclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by\nitself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of\nthe quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by\nthe addition of a further parameter ($\\nu$) to account for the action of\nretroviruses (i.e., the destruction of idiotypes by genotypes). We give\nsimulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues\nof quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the\nappearance of the so-called pathogenic idiotypes. Our main findings refer to\nhow $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$, a parameter describing the rate at which idiotypes get\nstimulated, relate to each other.

We use\nthe high quality time lag and r.m.s obtained during March 3rd 1996 observation\nof 4U 1608-52 by RXTE as well as other observations of the source at different\nQPO frequencies where a single time-lag between two broad energy bands have\nbeen reported. We compare the results obtained when assuming that the\ntime-averaged spectra are represented by the spectrally degenerate \"hot\" and\n\"cold\" seed photon spectral models. We find that for the \"hot\" seed photon\nmodel the medium size is in the range of 0.3-2.0 kms and the size decreases\nwith increasing QPO frequency. On the other hand for the \"cold\" seed photon\nmodel the range for the sizes are much larger 0.5-20 kms and hence perhaps show\nno variation with QPO frequency. Our results emphasis the need for broad band\nspectral information combined with high frequency timing to lift this\ndegeneracy. We further show that the r.m.s as a function of energy for the\nupper kHz QPO is similar to the lower one and indeed we find that the driver\nfor this QPO should be temperature variations of the corona identical to the\nlower kHz QPO. However, the time lag reported for the upper kHz QPO is hard,\nwhich if confirmed, would challenge the simple Comptonization model presented\nhere. It would perhaps imply that reverberation lags are also important and/or\nthe dominate spectral component is not a single temperature medium but a\nmulti-temperature complex one.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

Many\nother models take the contrary stand, namely that chain crossing constraints\ndominate the dynamics of nondilute polymer solutions, while hydrodynamic\ninteractions only create secondary corrections.

Such a soft film impregnated with magnetic particles can be\nmodulated with an external electromagnetic field that produces a vast array of\ntopographical landscapes with varying surface curvature, which, in conjunction\nwith capillarity, can direct and control motion of water droplets efficiently\nand accurately. When a thin layer of oil is present on this film that is\ndeformed locally, a centrosymmetric wedge is formed. A water droplet placed on\nthis oil laden film becomes asymmetrically deformed thus producing a gradient\nof Laplace pressure within the droplet setting it to motion. A simple theory is\npresented that accounts for the droplet speed in terms of such geometric\nvariables as the volume of the droplet and the thickness of the oil film\ncovering the soft elastomeric film, as well as such material variables as the\nviscosity of the oil and interfacial tension of the oil-water interfaces.\nFollowing the verification of the theoretical result using well-controlled\nmodel systems, we demonstrate how the electromagnetically controlled\nelasto-capillary force can be used to manipulate the motion of single and/or\nmultiple droplets on the surface of the elastomeric film and how such\nelementary operations as drop fusion and thermally addressed chemical\ntransformation can be carried out in aqueous droplets.

Among these new\ncluster members is CTIO-160 (M7), the first IC2391 candidate to satisfy all\ncriteria for being a substellar member of the cluster, including detection of\nthe Li 6708A doublet. With the enlarged membership, we are able to locate the\nlithium depletion boundary of the cluster more reliably than in the past. Based\non comparison to several theoretical models, we derive an age of 50+-5 Myr for\nIC2391. We also estimate new ages for the Alpha Per and Pleiades clusters; our\nages are 85+-10 Myr and 130+-20 Myr, respectively. We derive an estimate of the\ninitial mass function of IC2391 that extends to below the substellar limit, and\ncompare it to those of other well-studied young open clusters.

The particles of the symmetric phase (`phions')\ninteract via a hard-core repulsion and an induced, long-range -1/r^3\nattraction. If the phion mass is sufficiently small, the lowest-energy state is\nnot the `empty' state with no phions, but is a state with a non-zero density of\nphions Bose-Einstein condensed in the zero-momentum mode. The condensate\ncorresponds to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking vacuum with <Phi> neq 0 and\nits excitations (\"phonons\" in atomic-physics language) correspond to Higgs\nparticles. The phase transition happens when the phion's physical mass m is\nstill positive; it does not wait until m^2 passes through zero and becomes\nnegative. However, at and near the phase transition, m is much, much less than\nthe Higgs mass M_h. This interesting physics coexists with `triviality;' all\nscattering amplitudes vanish in the continuum limit, but the vacuum condensate\nbecomes infinitely dense. The ratio m/M_h, which goes to zero in the continuum\nlimit, can be viewed as a measure of non-locality in the regularized theory. An\nintricate hierarchy of length scales naturally arises.
