Precise detection of the GRB polarization\ncarried out by dedicated instruments can provide new data and be an ultimate\ntool to unveil their real nature. A novel space-borne Compton polarimeter POLAR\nonboard the Chinese space station TG2 is designed to measure linear\npolarization of gamma-rays arriving from GRB prompt emissions. POLAR uses\nplastics scintillator bars (PS) as gamma-ray detectors and multi-anode\nphotomultipliers (MAPMTs) for readout of the scintillation light. Inherent\nproperties of such detection systems are crosstalk and non-uniformity. The\ncrosstalk smears recorded energy over multiple channels making both\nnon-uniformity corrections and energy calibration more difficult. Rigorous\nextraction of polarization observable requires to take such effects properly\ninto account. We studied influence of the crosstalk on energy depositions\nduring laboratory measurements with X-ray beams. A relation between genuine and\nrecorded energy was deduced using an introduced model of data analysis. It\npostulates that both the crosstalk and non-uniformities can be described with a\nsingle matrix obtained in calibrations with mono-energetic X- and gamma-rays.\nNecessary corrections are introduced using matrix based equations allowing for\nproper evaluation of the measured GRB spectra. Validity of the method was\nestablished during dedicated experimental tests. The same approach can be also\napplied in space utilizing POLAR internal calibration sources.

With an eye towards true end-to-end\nlearning, we suggest learning the applied transformations on a per-class basis.\nParticularly, we align image pairs within each class under the assumption that\nthe spatial transformation between images belongs to a large class of\ndiffeomorphisms. We then learn a class-specific probabilistic generative models\nof the transformations in a Riemannian submanifold of the Lie group of\ndiffeomorphisms.

One major challenge inevitably\nmet when trying to infer the existence of one or more subclasses is the time\nconsuming, and subjective, process of subclass definition. In this work, we\nshow how machine learning tools facilitate identification of subtypes of SNeIa\nthrough the establishment of a hierarchical group structure in the continuous\nspace of spectral diversity formed by these objects. Using Deep Learning, we\nwere capable of performing such identification in a 4 dimensional feature space\n(+1 for time evolution), while the standard Principal Component Analysis barely\nachieves similar results using 15 principal components. This is evidence that\nthe progenitor system and the explosion mechanism can be described by a small\nnumber of initial physical parameters. As a proof of concept, we show that our\nresults are in close agreement with a previously suggested classification\nscheme and that our proposed method can grasp the main spectral features behind\nthe definition of such subtypes. This allows the confirmation of the velocity\nof lines as a first order effect in the determination of SNIa subtypes,\nfollowed by 91bg-like events.

In\na previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated\ngenotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of\ninterrelated idiotypes (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does\nnot cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study\nof quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the\nconclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by\nitself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of\nthe quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by\nthe addition of a further parameter ($\\nu$) to account for the action of\nretroviruses (i.e., the destruction of idiotypes by genotypes). We give\nsimulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues\nof quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the\nappearance of the so-called pathogenic idiotypes. Our main findings refer to\nhow $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$, a parameter describing the rate at which idiotypes get\nstimulated, relate to each other.

It was also shown that such an\ninterpretation can provide estimates of the size and geometry of the\nComptonizing medium. Here we study the dependence of these estimates on the\ntime-averaged spectral model assumed and on the frequency of the QPO. We use\nthe high quality time lag and r.m.s obtained during March 3rd 1996 observation\nof 4U 1608-52 by RXTE as well as other observations of the source at different\nQPO frequencies where a single time-lag between two broad energy bands have\nbeen reported. We compare the results obtained when assuming that the\ntime-averaged spectra are represented by the spectrally degenerate \"hot\" and\n\"cold\" seed photon spectral models. We find that for the \"hot\" seed photon\nmodel the medium size is in the range of 0.3-2.0 kms and the size decreases\nwith increasing QPO frequency. On the other hand for the \"cold\" seed photon\nmodel the range for the sizes are much larger 0.5-20 kms and hence perhaps show\nno variation with QPO frequency. Our results emphasis the need for broad band\nspectral information combined with high frequency timing to lift this\ndegeneracy. We further show that the r.m.s as a function of energy for the\nupper kHz QPO is similar to the lower one and indeed we find that the driver\nfor this QPO should be temperature variations of the corona identical to the\nlower kHz QPO. However, the time lag reported for the upper kHz QPO is hard,\nwhich if confirmed, would challenge the simple Comptonization model presented\nhere. It would perhaps imply that reverberation lags are also important and/or\nthe dominate spectral component is not a single temperature medium but a\nmulti-temperature complex one.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

Many\nother models take the contrary stand, namely that chain crossing constraints\ndominate the dynamics of nondilute polymer solutions, while hydrodynamic\ninteractions only create secondary corrections.

In this work, we present a formal framework\nfor pricing queries over data that allows the construction of general families\nof pricing functions, with the main goal of avoiding arbitrage. We consider two\ntypes of pricing schemes: instance-independent schemes, where the price depends\nonly on the structure of the query, and answer-dependent schemes, where the\nprice also depends on the query output. Our main result is a complete\ncharacterization of the structure of pricing functions in both settings, by\nrelating it to properties of a function over a lattice. We use our\ncharacterization, together with information-theoretic methods, to construct a\nvariety of arbitrage-free pricing functions.

Because of the network nature\nof this platform, programming patterns often correspond to patterns of\nconnectivity in the generalized recurrent neural networks understood as\nprograms.

The particles of the symmetric phase (`phions')\ninteract via a hard-core repulsion and an induced, long-range -1/r^3\nattraction. If the phion mass is sufficiently small, the lowest-energy state is\nnot the `empty' state with no phions, but is a state with a non-zero density of\nphions Bose-Einstein condensed in the zero-momentum mode. The condensate\ncorresponds to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking vacuum with <Phi> neq 0 and\nits excitations (\"phonons\" in atomic-physics language) correspond to Higgs\nparticles. The phase transition happens when the phion's physical mass m is\nstill positive; it does not wait until m^2 passes through zero and becomes\nnegative. However, at and near the phase transition, m is much, much less than\nthe Higgs mass M_h. This interesting physics coexists with `triviality;' all\nscattering amplitudes vanish in the continuum limit, but the vacuum condensate\nbecomes infinitely dense. The ratio m/M_h, which goes to zero in the continuum\nlimit, can be viewed as a measure of non-locality in the regularized theory. An\nintricate hierarchy of length scales naturally arises.
