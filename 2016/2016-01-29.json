On the experimental side, the LHC provides the best tool ever for\nreaching the saturated phase of hadronic matter. For this reason saturation\nphysics is a very active branch of QCD during these past and coming years since\nsaturation theories and experimental data can be compared.

On the one hand, the social\npressure exerted by peers favours the emergence of local consensus. On the\nother hand, the concurrent participation of agents to discussions on different\ntopics induces each agent to develop a coherent set of opinions across all the\ntopics in which he is active. Moreover, the pervasive action of external\nstimuli, such as mass media, pulls the entire population towards a specific\nconfiguration of opinions on different topics. Here we propose a model in which\nagents with interrelated opinions, interacting on several layers representing\ndifferent topics, tend to spread their own ideas to their neighbourhood, strive\nto maintain internal coherence, due to the fact that each agent identifies\nmeaningful relationships among its opinions on the different topics, and are at\nthe same time subject to external fields, resembling the pressure of mass\nmedia. We show that the presence of heterogeneity in the internal coupling\nassigned by agents to their different opinions allows to obtain states with\nmixed levels of consensus, still ensuring that all the agents attain a coherent\nset of opinions. Furthermore, we show that all the observed features of the\nmodel are preserved in the presence of thermal noise up to a critical\ntemperature, after which global consensus is no longer attainable. This\nsuggests the relevance of our results for real social systems, where noise is\ninevitably present in the form of information uncertainty and\nmisunderstandings.

We discuss the boiling crisis, a transition between two regimes of\nboiling: nucleate and film boiling. The boiling crisis results in a sharp\ndecrease in the heat transfer rate, which can cause a major accident in\nindustrial heat exchangers. In this communication, we present a physical model\nof the boiling crisis based on the vapor recoil effect. Under the action of the\nvapor recoil the gas bubbles begin to spread over the heater thus forming a\ngerm for the vapor film. The vapor recoil force not only causes its spreading,\nit also creates a strong adhesion to the heater that prevents the bubble\ndeparture, thus favoring the further spreading. Near the liquid-gas critical\npoint, the bubble growth is very slow and allows the kinetics of the bubble\nspreading to be observed. Since the surface tension is very small in this\nregime, only microgravity conditions can preserve a convex bubble shape. In the\nexperiments both in the Mir space station and in the magnetic levitation\nfacility, we directly observed an increase of the apparent contact angle and\nspreading of the dry spot under the bubble.

Particle tracking in the lab frame\nusually treats time as an independent variable. Then, the evolution of electron\nbeams is treated according to the absolute time convention (non-standard clock\nsynchronization). This point has never received attention in the accelerator\ncommunity. There are two ways of coupling fields and particles. The first,\nLorentz's way, consists in `translating' Maxwell's electrodynamics to the\nabsolute time world-picture. The second, Einstein's way, consists in\n`translating' particle tracking results to the electromagnetic world-picture.\nConventional particle tracking shows that the electron beam direction changes\nafter a transverse kick, while the orientation of the microbunching fronts\nstays unvaried. We show that under Einstein's time order, in the\nultrarelativistic asymptote the orientation of the planes of simultaneity is\nalways perpendicular to the electron beam velocity. This allows for the\nproduction of coherent undulator radiation from a modulated electron beam in\nthe kicked direction without suppression. We hold a recent FEL study at the\nLCLS as experimental evidence of microbunching wavefront readjusting after a\nlarge kick. In a previous paper we quantitatively described this result\ninvoking the aberration of light, corresponding to Lorentz's way of coupling\nfields and particles.

We also demonstrate that an `inverse translation' of particle\ntracking results to the standard time order resolves puzzles related with the\nstrong qualitative disagreement between simulations and experiments.
