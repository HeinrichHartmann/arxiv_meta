Depending on the type of constraints that we allow in\nthe input, a CSP might be tractable, or computationally hard.

Many problems from areas that have so\nfar seen no interaction with constraint satisfaction theory can be formulated\nusing infinite domains, e.g. problems from temporal and spatial reasoning,\nphylogenetic reconstruction, and operations research.\n  It turns out that the universal-algebraic approach can also be applied to\nstudy large classes of infinite-domain CSPs, yielding elegant complexity\nclassification results.

In previous\nversions of the level-crossing method, problems with it correspond to the fact\nthat this method had been developed for analyzing a continuous-time process or\nat most a multiple continuous-time process in an individual manner. However,\nsince all empirical processes are discrete in time, the already-established\nlevel-crossing method may not prove adequate for studying empirical processes.\nBeyond this, due to the fact that most empirical processes are coupled; their\nindividual study could lead to vague results. To achieve the objectives of this\nstudy, we first find an analytical expression for the average frequency of\ncrossing a level in a discrete-time process, giving the measure of the time\nexperienced for two consecutive crossings named as the \"waiting time\". We then\nintroduce the generalized level-crossing method by which the consideration of\ncoupling between the components of a multiple process becomes possible.\nFinally, we provide an analytic solution when the components of a multiple\nstochastic process are independent Gaussian white noises.

If a GW signal is observed with sufficient\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the masses and spins of the black holes can be estimated\nfrom just the inspiral part of the signal. Using these estimates of the initial\nparameters of the binary, the mass and spin of the final black hole can be\nuniquely predicted making use of general-relativistic numerical simulations. In\naddition, the mass and spin of the final black hole can be independently\nestimated from the merger--ringdown part of the signal. If the binary black\nhole dynamics is correctly described by general relativity (GR), these\nindependent estimates have to be consistent with each other.

For instance, this happens when using classic\ntechniques based on automata, game-theory, SCC decomposition, and the like.\nSurprisingly, no temporal logics have been considered so far with the explicit\nability of talking about cycles.\n  In this paper we introduce Cycle-CTL*, an extension of the classical\nbranching-time temporal logic CTL* along with cycle quantifications in order to\npredicate over cycles.

Percolation theory provides a generic framework to study the behavior\nof the cluster distribution. In most cases the theory predicts a geometrical\ntransition at the percolation threshold, characterized in the percolative phase\nby the presence of a spanning cluster, which becomes infinite in the\nthermodynamic limit. Standard percolation usually deals with the problem when\nthe constitutive elements of the clusters are randomly distributed. However\ncorrelations cannot always be neglected. In this case correlated percolation is\nthe appropriate theory to study such systems. The origin of correlated\npercolation could be dated back to 1937 when Mayer [1] proposed a theory to\ndescribe the condensation from a gas to a liquid in terms of mathematical\nclusters (for a review of cluster theory in simple fluids see [2]). The\nlocation for the divergence of the size of these clusters was interpreted as\nthe condensation transition from a gas to a liquid. One of the major drawback\nof the theory was that the cluster number for some values of thermodynamic\nparameters could become negative. As a consequence the clusters did not have\nany physical interpretation [3]. This theory was followed by Frenkel's\nphenomenological model [4], in which the fluid was considered as made of non\ninteracting physical clusters with a given free energy. This model was later\nimproved by Fisher [3], who proposed a different free energy for the clusters,\nnow called droplets, and consequently a different scaling form for the droplet\nsize distribution. This distribution, which depends on two geometrical\nparameters, has the nice feature that the mean droplet size exhibits a\ndivergence at the liquid-gas critical point.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We note that in both cases the Shannon entropy increases linearly during\nthe initial stages of mixing and then saturates toward constant values.\nFurthermore, chemical elements with different mobilities display different\nrates of increase of the Shannon entropy. This indicates that the hybrid\ncomposition for the different elements is attained at different times\ngenerating a wide range of spatio-compositional domains which further increase\nthe apparent complexity of the mixing process.

In particular, the Shannon entropy can be\nused as complement to the RCV method to quantify the mobility of chemical\nelements in magma mixing systems, to obtain information about the rate of\nproduction of compositional heterogeneities, and to derive empirical\nrelationships linking the rate of chemical exchanges between interacting magmas\nand mixing time.\n"]}]

By using the described and successful hardware\nmirroring process it was possible to bypass the limit on passcode retry\nattempts. This is the first public demonstration of the working prototype and\nthe real hardware mirroring process for iPhone 5c. Although the process can be\nimproved, it is still a successful proof-of-concept project. Knowledge of the\npossibility of mirroring will definitely help in designing systems with better\nprotection. Also some reliability issues related to the NAND memory allocation\nin iPhone 5c are revealed.

We simulate the realistic tree-dimensional (3D) magnetic\nfield using the data from the photospheric magnetic field measurements and\nassume the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Alfv\\'en wave turbulence and its\nnon-linear dissipation to be the only source for heating the coronal plasma and\ndriving the solar wind. In closed field regions the dissipation efficiency in a\nbalanced turbulence is enhanced. In the coronal holes we account for a\nreflection of the outward propagating waves, which is accompanied by generation\nof weaker counter-propagating waves. The non-linear cascade rate degrades in\nstrongly imbalanced turbulence, thus resulting in colder coronal holes.\n  The distinctive feature of the presented model is the description of the low\ncorona as almost-steady-state low-beta plasma motion and heat flux transfer\nalong the magnetic field lines. We trace the magnetic field lines through each\ngrid point of the lower boundary of the global corona model, chosen at some\nheliocentric distance, $R=R_{b}\\sim(1.03\\div1.15)R_\\odot$ well above the\ntransition region. One can readily solve the plasma parameters along the\nmagnetic field line from 1D equations for the plasma motion and heat transport\ntogether with the Alfv\\'en wave propagation, which adequately describe physics\nwithin the heliocentric distances range, $R_{\\odot}<R<R_{b}$, in the low solar\ncorona. By interfacing this threaded-field-lines model with the full MHD global\ncorona model at $r=R_{b}$, we find the global solution and achieve a\nfaster-than-real-time performance of the model.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This was done by simulating future\nlevels of total fertility and life expectancy from Bayesian hierarchical\nmodels, and combining the results using a standard cohort-component projection\nmethod. The 40 countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics were treated\ndifferently from others, in that the projections used the highly multistate\nSpectrum/EPP model, a complex 15-compartment model that was designed for\nshort-term projections of quantities relevant to policy for the epidemic. Here\nwe propose a simpler approach that is more compatible with the existing UN\nprobabilistic projection methodology for other countries. Changes in life\nexpectancy are projected probabilistically using a simple time series\nregression model on current life expectancy, HIV prevalence and ART coverage.\nThese are then converted to age- and sex-specific mortality rates using a new\nfamily of model life tables designed for countries with HIV/AIDS epidemics that\nreproduces the characteristic hump in middle adult mortality. These are then\ninput to the standard cohort-component method, as for other countries. The\nmethod performed well in an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment.
