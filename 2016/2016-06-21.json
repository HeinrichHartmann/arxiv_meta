Here we follow original works of Ne'eman and Fairlie believing that\nbosonic fields take their values in the Lie superalgebra and fermionic fields\ntake their values in its representation space. At the same time, our approach\ndiffers significantly. The main one is that while for them the gauge symmetry\ngroup is $SU(2/1)$, here we consider only symmetries generated by its even\nsubgroup, i.e., symmetries of the standard electroweak model. The reason is\nthat such formalism fixes the quartic Higgs coupling and at the same time\nremoves the sign and statistics problems. The main result is that the presented\nmodel predicts values of the Weinberg angle and the Higgs mass correctly up to\nthe two-loop level.

Although a few numerical works are available in the\nliterature for specific domains in three dimensions such a general analytical\nprescription is presented for the first time. An appropriate transformation is\nused to get rid of the asymmetries in the domain boundary by mapping the\nboundary into an equivalent sphere with a deformed interior metric. The\ndeformed metric produces new source terms in the original homogeneous equation.\nA deformation parameter measuring the deviation of the boundary from a\nspherical one is introduced as a perturbative parameter. With the help of\nstandard Rayleigh-Schr{\\\"o}dinger perturbative technique the transformed\nequation is solved and the general solution is written down in a closed form at\neach order of perturbation. The solutions are boundary condition free and which\nmake them widely applicable for various situations. Once the boundary\nconditions are applied to these general solutions the eigenvalues and the\nwavefunctions are obtained order by order. The efficacy of the method has been\ntested by comparing the analytic values against the numerical ones for three\ndimensional enclosures of various shapes. The method seems to work quite well\nfor these shapes for both, Dirichlet as well as Neumann boundary conditions.\nThe usage of spherical harmonics to express the asymmetries in the boundary\nsurfaces helps us to consider a wide class of domains in three dimensions and\nalso their fast convergence guarantees the convergence of the perturbative\nseries for the energy.

Based\non a fit of the competing risks model to a subset of the NIST experimental\ndata, we determine the mean lifetime of trapped neutrons to be approximately\n700 s -- considerably less than the current best estimate of (880.1 $\\pm$ 1.1)\ns promulgated by the Particle Data Group [1]. Currently, experimental studies\nare underway to determine if this discrepancy can be explained by neutron\ncapture by ${}^3$He impurities in the trapping volume. Analysis of the full\nNIST data will be presented in a later publication.\n","Comment: submitted to NIMA"]}]

In particular, we\nprovide theoretical guarantees for RUV-4 and LEAPP, which correspond to two\ndifferent identification conditions in the framework: the first requires a set\nof \"negative controls\" that are known a priori to follow the null distribution;\nthe second requires the true non-nulls to be sparse. Two different estimators\nwhich are based on RUV-4 and LEAPP are then applied to these two scenarios. We\nshow that if the confounding factors are strong, the resulting estimators can\nbe asymptotically as powerful as the oracle estimator which observes the latent\nconfounding factors. For hypothesis testing, we show the asymptotic z-tests\nbased on the estimators can control the type I error. Numerical experiments\nshow that the false discovery rate is also controlled by the Benjamini-Hochberg\nprocedure when the sample size is reasonably large.\n","Comment: The first two authors contributed equally to this paper"]}]

The response of the radio stations in the 30\nto 80 MHz regime has been thoroughly calibrated to enable the reconstruction of\nthe incoming electric field. For the latter, the energy deposit per area is\ndetermined from the radio pulses at each observer position and is interpolated\nusing a two-dimensional function that takes into account signal asymmetries due\nto interference between the geomagnetic and charge-excess emission components.\nThe spatial integral over the signal distribution gives a direct measurement of\nthe energy transferred from the primary cosmic ray into radio emission in the\nAERA frequency range. We measure 15.8 MeV of radiation energy for a 1 EeV air\nshower arriving perpendicularly to the geomagnetic field.

It is important to accelerate ConvNet training, which is\ncomputationally costly.

To attain such\nperformance on real shared-memory machines, our algorithm computes convolutions\nconverging on the same node of the network with temporal locality to reduce\ncache misses, and sums the convergent convolution outputs via an almost\nwait-free concurrent method to reduce time spent in critical sections. We\nimplement the algorithm with a publicly available software package called ZNN.\nBenchmarking with multi-core CPUs shows that ZNN can attain speedup roughly\nequal to the number of physical cores. We also show that ZNN can attain over\n90x speedup on a many-core CPU (Xeon Phi Knights Corner). These speedups are\nachieved for network architectures with widths that are in common use. The task\nparallelism of the ZNN algorithm is suited to CPUs, while the SIMD parallelism\nof previous algorithms is compatible with GPUs. Through examples, we show that\nZNN can be either faster or slower than certain GPU implementations depending\non specifics of the network architecture, kernel sizes, and density and size of\nthe output patch. ZNN may be less costly to develop and maintain, due to the\nrelative ease of general-purpose CPU programming.\n"]}]

Moreover, because the kinetic\nenergy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron\nhas no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection\nbetween frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds.

To demonstrate the\nviability of this framework, we show that the DQN's q-values associated with\noptimal action converge and that the Q-gradient descent algorithms outperform\ngradient descent with an Armijo or nonmonotone line search.

The relative rates\nof these processes are set by the relative energy density of the interstellar\nradiation field and the magnetic field within the Bubbles; consequently, under\nthe hypothesis of a common origin, the combination of the gamma-ray and\nmicrowave measurements can be used to estimate the magnetic field within the\nBubbles.

In standard quantum state merging,\nentanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum\noperations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments\nshow that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is\nreasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local\noperations which can create coherence.

Analogously,\nstates bound by a strong external field $A^\\mu(\\boldsymbol{x})$ are found as\neigenstates of the Dirac Hamiltonian. Their Fock states have dynamically\ncreated $e^+e^-$ pairs, whose distribution is determined by the Dirac wave\nfunction. The linear potential of $D=1+1$ dimensions confines electrons but\nrepels positrons. As a result, the mass spectrum is continuous and the wave\nfunctions have features of both bound states and plane waves.\n  The classical solutions of Gauss' law are explored for hadrons in QCD. A\nnon-vanishing boundary condition at spatial infinity generates a constant\n\\order{\\alpha_s^0} color electric field between quarks of specific colors.\nPoincar\\'e invariance limits the spectrum to color singlet $q\\bar q$ and $qqq$\nstates, which do not generate an external color field. This restricts the\n\\order{\\alpha_s^0} interactions between hadrons to string breaking dynamics as\nin dual diagrams. Light mesons lie on linear Regge and parallel daughter\ntrajectories. There are massless states which may be significant for chiral\nsymmetry breaking. Since the bound states are defined at equal time in all\nframes they have a non-trivial Lorentz covariance.\n","Comment: Based on lectures presented during 2014-15 at NIKHEF, Amsterdam; IPhT\n  Saclay; CP$^3$, Odense; GSI, Darmstadt; Bloomington, IN and Subatech, Nantes.\n  59 pages, 21 figures"]}]

This completely symmetric representation of the\nparticles makes it necessary to choose another solution of the Dirac equation\nfor the free particle propagator as compared to that currently used in QED. The\nBethe-Salpeter equation is studied in the ladder approximation with using these\nfree propagators. A new branch of electron-positron bound states which\nrepresent the massless composite bosons, have been found for the actual\ncoupling equal to the fine structure constant. We have obtained that: 1) the\nmassless boson states have the normalized complex wave functions; 2) the\naverage distance between the electron and positron diverges as the boson\nkinetic energy goes to zero; 3) the spatial contraction of the wave function of\nthe transverse motion of strongly coupled electron-positron pair is\ncontinuously occurred with increasing the boson kinetic energy. Unlike the\nusual annihilation process in which nothing remains from the electron and\npositron, a similar annihilation-like process in which the reaction products\nare two or three gamma quanta and the massless boson, is predicted. In this\nsymmetric representation one could expect states, which have a certain symmetry\nrelative to Ps states, but have negative masses. For these states the\nequal-time bound-state equation was derived neglecting the interaction\nretardation and interaction through the vector potential. It turned out that\nthe wave functions of the negative mass boson states are not normalized.

Realizing these electronic phases requires preserving the\ndesired transport properties down to a monolayer, which is challenging. Here,\nusing semimetallic $WTe_2$ that exhibits large magnetoresistance, we show that\nsurface oxidation and Fermi level pinning degrade the transport properties of\nthin $WTe_2$ flakes significantly. With decreasing $WTe_2$ flake thickness, we\nobserve a dramatic suppression of the large magnetoresistance. This is\nexplained by fitting a two-band model to the transport data, which shows that\nmobility of the electron and hole carriers decreases significantly for thin\nflakes. The microscopic origin of this mobility decrease is attributed to a ~ 2\nnm-thick amorphous surface oxide layer that introduces disorder. The oxide\nlayer also shifts the Fermi level by ~ 300 meV at the $WTe_2$ surface. However,\nband bending due to this Fermi level shift is not the dominant cause for the\nsuppression of magnetoresistance as the electron and hole carrier densities are\nbalanced down to ~ 13 nm based on the two-band model.

The\nobjective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base\nstation (MBS) given that all requests should be served simultaneously to\nsatisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS\noffloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and\nshow that it is NP-hard.

At each\ncoarse-grid scale, we assume that the offline space is a good approximation of\nthe solution and use all possible offline functions or randomization as\nboundary conditions and solve the local problems in the offline space at the\nprevious (finer) level, to construct snapshot space.

In this dissertation,\nwe propose a high resolution digital calibration method, called extended\nstatistical element selection (ESES).

Two types of ESES\nbased calibration application in analog/RF circuits are also proposed. One is\ncurrent source calibration and the other is phase/delay calibration. To verify\nthis proposed digital calibration method in circuit implementation, we\ndesigned, fabricated and tested a wideband harmonic rejection receiver design.\nThe receiver utilizes ESES-based gain and phase error calibration for improving\nharmonic rejection ratios. With the high calibration resolution provided by the\nESES method, after calibration, we achieved best-in-class harmonic rejection\nratios. To extend the application of the proposed method, we further designed a\ncurrent-steering D/A data converter (CS-DAC).

Fast evaluation of integral transforms on such an adaptive grid\nrequires an algorithm that relies on the smoothness of the continuum kernel\nonly, independent of its discrete form.

In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second\nderivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite\ndifference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its\nprecision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the\nincrement. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty\nand its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in\nfinance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives\nhave to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the\nprecision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the\nfeasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare\nVibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show\nthat it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise\nfor second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato.

We propose this as a\nwell defined and general tool to quantify the performance of different\nexperiments in relation to different theoretical models. In particular, the\nassessment of experimental performance will benefit enormously from the fact\nthat this method is invariant under re-parametrization of the model. We apply\nthis to future surveys and compare expected knowledge advancements to the most\nrelevant experiments performed over the history of modern cosmology. When\nconsidering the standard cosmological model, we show that it will rapidly reach\nknowledge saturation in the near future and forthcoming improvements will not\nmatch the past ones. On the contrary, we find that new observations have the\npotential for unprecedented knowledge jumps when extensions of the standard\nscenario are considered.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The dependence on these grammars, however, makes it\ndifficult to adapt to noisy and new languages. In this paper we develop a\ndata-driven approach to identifying semantic roles, the approach is entirely\nunsupervised up to the point where rules need to be learned to identify the\nposition the semantic role occurs. Specifically we develop a modified-ADIOS\nalgorithm based on ADIOS Solan et al.
