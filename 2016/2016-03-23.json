Since it is\nbased on a Fabry-Perot interferometer working in collimated beam, the TF\ntransmission wavelength depends on the position of the target with respect to\nthe optical axis. This effect is non-negligible and must be accounted for in\nthe data reduction. Our paper establishes a wavelength calibration for OSIRIS\nTF with the accuracy required for spectrophotometric measurements using the\nfull field of view (FOV) of the instrument. The variation of the transmission\nwavelength $\\lambda(R)$ across the FOV is well described by\n$\\lambda(R)=\\lambda(0)/\\sqrt{1+(R/f_2)^2}$, where $\\lambda(0)$ is the central\nwavelength, $R$ represents the physical distance from the optical axis, and\n$f_2=185.70\\pm0.17\\,$mm is the effective focal length of the camera lens. This\nnew empirical calibration yields an accuracy better than 1\\,\\AA\\ across the\nentire OSIRIS FOV ($\\sim$8\\arcmin$\\times$8\\arcmin), provided that the position\nof the optical axis is known within 45 $\\mu$m ($\\equiv$ 1.5 binned pixels). We\nsuggest a calibration protocol to grant such precision over long periods, upon\nre-alignment of OSIRIS optics, and in different wavelength ranges. This\ncalibration differs from the calibration in OSIRIS manual which, nonetheless,\nprovides an accuracy $\\lesssim1$\\AA\\, for $R\\lesssim 2\\arcmin$.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in PASP"]}]

The internal energy of such systems lacks extensivity and\nadditivity. Although the extensivity can be restored by scaling the interaction\npotential with the number of particles, the non-additivity still remains. Lack\nof additivity leads to inequivalence of statistical ensembles. Before relaxing\nto thermodynamic equilibrium, isolated systems with LR forces become trapped in\nout-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary state (qSS), the lifetime of which diverges\nwith the number of particles. Therefore, in thermodynamic limit LR systems will\nnot relax to equilibrium. The qSSs are attained through the process of\ncollisionless relaxation.

While the diffusion forecasting method assumes the\navailability of a noise-free training data set observing the full state space\nof the dynamics, in real applications we often have only partial observations\nwhich are corrupted by noise. To alleviate these practical issues, following\nthe theory of embedology, the diffusion model is built using the\ndelay-embedding coordinates of the data.

The\nconjecture specifies a measure for the degree of contextuality and a criterion\n(necessary and sufficient condition) for contextuality in a broad class of\nquantum systems. This class includes Leggett-Garg, EPR/Bell, and\nKlyachko-Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky type systems as special cases. In a system of\nthis class certain physical properties $q_{1},...,q_{n}$ are measured in pairs\n$(q_{i},q_{j})$; every property enters in precisely two such pairs; and each\nmeasurement outcome is a binary random variable. Denoting the measurement\noutcomes for a property $q_{i}$ in the two pairs it enters by $V_{i}$ and\n$W_{i}$, the pair of measurement outcomes for $(q_{i},q_{j})$ is\n$(V_{i},W_{j})$. Contextuality is defined as follows: one computes the minimal\npossible value $\\Delta_{0}$ for the sum of $\\Pr[V_{i}\\not=W_{i}]$ (over\n$i=1,...,n$) that is allowed by the individual distributions of $V_{i}$ and\n$W_{i}$; one computes the minimal possible value $\\Delta_{\\min}$ for the sum of\n$\\Pr[V_{i}\\not=W_{i}]$ across all possible couplings of (i.e., joint\ndistributions imposed on) the entire set of random variables\n$V_{1},W_{1},...,V_{n},W_{n}$ in the system; and the system is considered\ncontextual if $\\Delta_{\\min}>\\Delta_{0}$ (otherwise\n$\\Delta_{\\min}=\\Delta_{0}$). This definition has its justification in the\ngeneral approach dubbed Contextuality-by-Default, and it allows for measurement\nerrors and signaling among the measured properties.

Since localization leads to Poissonian energy level\nstatistics, we ask if localized systems possess \"additional\" integrals of\nmotion as well, so as to enhance the analogy with quantum integrable systems.\nWe answer this in the affirmative in the present work. We construct a set of\nnontrivial integrals of motion for Anderson localized models, in terms of the\noriginal creation and annihilation operators. These are found as a power series\nin the hopping parameter. The recently found Type-1 Hamiltonians, which are\nknown to be quantum integrable in a precise sense, motivate our construction.\nWe note that these models can be viewed as disordered electron models with\ninfinite-range hopping, where a similar series truncates at the linear order.\nWe show that despite the infinite range hopping, all states but one are\nlocalized. We also study the conservation laws for the disorder free\nAubry-Andre model, where the states are either localized or extended, depending\non the strength of a coupling constant. We formulate a specific procedure for\naveraging over disorder, in order to examine the convergence of the power\nseries. Using this procedure in the Aubry-Andre model, we show that integrals\nof motion given by our construction are well-defined in localized phase, but\nnot so in the extended phase. Finally, we also obtain the integrals of motion\nfor a model with interactions to lowest order in the interaction.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Independents conduct\nvoting based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, herders base their\nvoting on the number of previous votes. Hence, herders vote for the majority\ncandidates and obtain information relating to previous votes from their\nnetworks. We discuss the difference between the phases on which the networks\ndepend. Two kinds of phase transitions, an information cascade transition and a\nsuper-normal transition, were identified.

The second is a transition of convergence speed.\nThe information cascade transition prevails when herder effects are stronger\nthan the super-normal transition.

The kinetics of such reactions is defined by the so-called\nreaction operator which determines the radical-pair state as a function of\nintermediate transition rates. We argue that the well-known concept of quantum\nwalks from quantum information theory is a natural and apt framework for\ndescribing multisite chemical reactions. By composing Kraus maps that act only\non two sites at a time, we show how the quantum-walk formalism can be applied\nto derive a reaction operator for the standard avian radical-pair reaction.

It is observed that in the case of dark soliton chains,\nthe formulated reduction dynamics provides an accurate description for the\nrobust evolution of travelling compression waves.

When the\nhypersoliton reaches the end of the central chain, a dark soliton is ejected\naway from the center of the trap and, as it returns from its excursion up the\ntrap, hits the central chain producing again a hypersoliton.

We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate\npolicy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers.

The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling\napproach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its\nuse in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption\nand diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3)\ninteractions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and\n(4) the anticipation of policy outcomes.

In any concrete implementation of PGM,\nthe SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under\nsome global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate\nfor such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with\nthe difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the\nSUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the\nrespective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level. As a\nparticularly interesting consequence, we find that the heavy Majorana neutrino\nmass scale ends up being tied to the gravitino mass, Lambda_N ~ m_3/2. Assuming\nnonthermal leptogenesis to be responsible for the generation of the baryon\nasymmetry of the universe, this connection may then explain why SUSY\nnecessarily needs to be broken at a rather high energy scale, so that m_3/2 >~\n1000 TeV in accord with the concept of PGM.

For spins, however,\nspontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative\nrelaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole\nand the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the\nelectromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum\nfluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work\nrepresents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of\nindividual spins to microwave photons.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

Here we examine bioinformatic fractal scaling analysis for\nidentifying sensitive epitopes from the p53 amino acid sequence, and show how\nit could be used for early cancer detection (ECD). We trim 15mers to 7mers, and\nidentify specific 7mers from other species that could be more sensitive to\naggressive human cancers, such as liver cancer.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 12 figures"]}]

Such models generally assume the existence of\nStandard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later\nconsequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that\nDM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is\ngenerated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not\nnecessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially\nleads to too much entropy in the dark sector. We address the latter issue by\nthe late decay of heavy particles produced at early times, associating the DM\nrelic density with the lifetime of a long-lived state. We ask what it would\ntake for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call\nFlooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is\nthat DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most\nnatural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the\ndecaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling\nand hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter\ncontent of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We\nalso show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector,\nrelaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the\nimplications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has\ninteresting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and\nbaryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump.\nAlternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis\nimplementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time\nreheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of\na lepton asymmetry.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Hence we develop a procedure applicable for\nall $Z\\geq6$ to estimate the elastic scattering. The elastic cross section is\nobtained at low to moderate photon energies, somewhat beyond the giant dipole\nresonance, by means of the optical theorem, a dispersion relation, and data on\nthe total absorption cross section. The cross section is continued at higher\nenergies by invoking depletion due to loss of coherence in the scattering. Our\nprocedure is intended for any ion where absorption data is available and for\nmoderate to high energies, $\\gamma \\gtrsim 10$.\n"]}]

In this\nformation channel LMXBs are formed from wide binaries $(>1000$ AU) with a BH\ncomponent and a stellar companion. The wide binary is perturbed by fly-by's of\nfield stars and its orbit random-walks and changes over time. This diffusion\nprocess can drive the binary into a sufficiently eccentric orbit such that the\nbinary components tidally interact at peri-center and the binary evolves to\nbecome a short period binary, which eventually evolves into an LMXB. The\nformation rate of LMXBs through this channel mostly depends on the number of\nsuch BH wide binaries progenitors, which in turn depends on the velocity kicks\nimparted to BHs (or NSs) at birth. We consider several models for the formation\nand survival of such wide binaries, and calculate the LMXB formation rates for\neach model. We find that models where BHs form through direct collapse with\nno/little natal kicks can give rise to high formation rates comparable with\nthose inferred from observations. This formation scenario had several\nobservational signatures: (1) the number density of LMXBs generally follows the\nbackground stellar density and (2) the mass function of the BH stellar\ncompanion should be comparable to the mass function of the background stellar\npopulation, likely peaking at $0.4-0.6$ M$_{\\odot}$. The latter aspect, in\nparticular, is unique to this model compared with previously suggested LMXB\nformation models following common envelope binary stellar evolution. We note\nthat NS LMXBs can similarly form from wide binaries, but their formation rate\nthrough this channel is likely significantly smaller due to their much higher\nnatal kicks.\n"]}]

Using both a\nBoltzmann approach and a diagrammatic Kubo approach, we describe the\nconductivity tensor within the diffusive regime. In particular, we show that\nboth the anisotropy of the Fermi surface and the Dirac nature of the\neigenstates combine to give rise to anisotropic transport times, manifesting\nthemselves through an unusual matrix self-energy.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 14 figures"]}]

However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem.

This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory.

The spin-down of this remnant NS that is highly\nmagnetized would power the isotropic merger ejecta to produce a bright\nmergernova emission in ultraviolet/optical bands. Before the mergernova, the\nearly interaction between the NS wind and the ejecta can drive a forward shock\npropagating outwards into the ejecta. As a result, a remarkable amount of heat\ncan be accumulated behind the shock front and the final escaping of this heat\ncan produce a shock breakout emission.

The rippling\namplitude, the equilibrium average separation, and the average interaction\nenergy are predicted simultaneously and compared with molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations. While the amplitude of thermal rippling is reduced by adhesive\ninteractions, the entropic contribution leads to an effective repulsion. As a\nresult, the equilibrium average separation increases and the effective adhesion\nenergy decreases with increasing temperature. Moreover, the effect of a biaxial\npre-strain in graphene is considered, and a buckling instability is predicted\nat a critical compressive strain that depends on both the temperature and the\nadhesive interactions. Limited by the harmonic approximations, the theoretical\npredictions agree with MD simulations only for relatively small rippling\namplitudes but can be extended to account for the anharmonic effects.\n","Comment: 9 figures.

We conduct a\npost-process stellar evolution calculation using the obtained accretion\nhistory. Our results show that, regardless of the strong variability of the\naccretion rates, the stellar radius monotonically increases with almost\nconstant effective temperature at $T_{\\rm eff} \\simeq 5000$ K as the stellar\nmass increases. The resulting UV feedback is too weak to hinder mass accretion\ndue to the low flux of stellar UV photons, thus verifying our implicit\nassumption of no stellar feedback during the hydrodynamic simulations. The\ninsensitivity of stellar evolution to variable accretion is attributed to the\nfact that typical timescales of variability, $\\lesssim 10^3$ years, are too\nshort to affect the stellar structure. We argue that this evolution will\ncontinue until the SMS eventually collapses to produce a massive black hole by\nthe general relativistic instability after the stellar mass reaches $\\gtrsim\n10^5~M_\\odot$.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

The ratio of SFR to BH accretion rate is approximately\n80 for the detected sources and less than 10 for the undetected sources.

Using our\napproach, the influence of physical parameters on both translational and time\ndynamics are considered at the same level in the analysis, and mutual\ncorrelations between the signatures of the two are automatically identified. We\nperform a covariance analysis using our proposed method with simulated laser\ndata from Earth-based stations to both a Mars and Mercury lander.\n  Using four years of tracking data for the Mars lander simulations, we find a\ndifference between our results using the simultaneous space-time dynamics\nestimation and the classical analysis technique (with an ta priori time\nephemeris) of around 0.1 % in formal errors and correlation coefficients. For a\nMercury lander this rises to around 1% for a 1-month mission and 10 % for a\n4-year mission. By means of Monte Carlo simulation, we find that using an a\npriori time ephemeris of representative accuracy will result in estimation\nerrors that are orders of magnitude above the formal error when processing\nhighly accurate laser time transfer data.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

Rapid selection of high-z candidates from\nGRB samples reported in real time by dedicated space missions such as Swift is\nthe key to identifying the most distant bursts before the optical afterglow\nbecomes too dim to warrant a good spectrum. Here we introduce \"machine-z\", a\nredshift prediction algorithm and a \"high-z\" classifier for Swift GRBs based on\nmachine learning. Our method relies exclusively on canonical data commonly\navailable within the first few hours after the GRB trigger. Using a sample of\n284 bursts with measured redshifts, we trained a randomized ensemble of\ndecision trees (random forest) to perform both regression and classification.\nCross-validated performance studies show that the correlation coefficient\nbetween machine-z predictions and the true redshift is nearly 0.6. At the same\ntime our high-z classifier can achieve 80% recall of true high-redshift bursts,\nwhile incurring a false positive rate of 20%. With 40% false positive rate the\nclassifier can achieve ~100% recall. The most reliable selection of\nhigh-redshift GRBs is obtained by combining predictions from both the high-z\nclassifier and the machine-z regressor.\n","Comment: Accepted to the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\n  Journal (10 pages, 10 figures, and 3 Tables)"]}]

For a proper interpretation of\nthe data, final-state interactions (FSI) need to be theoretically controlled.\n  Purpose: Our goal is to quantify the role of FSI effects in exclusive\n$A(e,e'pN)$ reactions for four target nuclei representative for the whole mass\nregion. Our focus is on processes that are SRC driven. We investigate the role\nof FSI for two characteristic detector setups corresponding with a \"small\" and\n\"large\" coverage of the available phase space.\n  Results: The transparency $T^{pN}_{A}$, defined as the ratio of exclusive\n$(e,e'pN)$ cross sections on nuclei to those on \"free\" nucleon pairs, drops\nfrom $ 0.2-0.3 $ for $^{12}$C to $0.04-0.07$ for $^{208}$Pb.

In this\nwork, we study the effect of an atomic defect on a skyrmion using the\nfirst-principles calculations within the density functional theory, taking MnSi\nas an example. By substituting one site of Mn or Si with different elements, we\ncan tune the pinning energy. The effects of pinning by an atomic defect can be\nunderstood qualitatively within a phenomenological model.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Apparently, $f(R,T)$ contributions to a\nradiation-dominated universe may rise only from the $f(R,T^\\varphi)$ approach,\nwhich is nothing but the $f(R,T)$ gravity in the case of a self-interacting\nscalar field whose trace of the energy-momentum tensor is $T^\\varphi$. We\nintend, in this article, to show how $f(R,T^\\varphi)$ theories of gravity can\ncontribute to the study of the primordial stages of the universe. Our results\npredict a graceful exit from inflationary stage to a radiation-dominated era.\nThey also predict a late-time cosmic acceleration after a matter-dominated\nphase, making the $f(R,T^\\varphi)$ theories able to describe, in a\nself-consistent way, all the different stages of the universe dynamics.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We\nobserved a significant portion of the Galactic plane in the first quadrant of\nthe Milky Way in the 21cm HI line, 4 OH transitions, 19 radio recombination\nlines, and continuum from 1 to 2 GHz. In this paper we present a catalog of the\ncontinuum sources in the first half of the survey (l=14.0-37.9deg and\nl=47.1-51.2deg, |b|<1.1deg) at a spatial resolution of 10-25\", with a spatially\nvarying noise level of ~0.3-1 mJy/beam. The catalog contains ~4400 sources.\nAround 1200 of these are spatially resolved, and ~1000 are possible artifacts,\ngiven their low signal-to-noise ratios. Since the spatial distribution of the\nunresolved objects is evenly distributed and not confined to the Galactic\nplane, most of them are extragalactic. Thanks to the broad bandwidth of the\nobservations from 1 to 2 GHz, we are able to determine a reliable spectral\nindex for ~1800 sources. The spectral index distribution reveals a\ndouble-peaked profile with maxima at spectral indices of alpha = -1 and alpha =\n0 , corresponding to steep declining and flat spectra, respectively. This\nallows us to distinguish between thermal and non-thermal emission, which can be\nused to determine the nature of each source. We examine the spectral index of\n~300 known HII regions, for which we find thermal emission with spectral\nindices around alpha = 0. In contrast, supernova remnants (SNR) show\nnon-thermal emission with alpha = -0.5 and extragalactic objects generally have\na steeper spectral index of alpha = -1. Using the spectral index information of\nthe THOR survey, we investigate potential SNR candidates. We classify the\nradiation of four SNR candidates as non-thermal, and for the first time, we\nprovide strong evidence for the SNR origin of these candidates.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 34 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

This limit is approached in cases\nwhere the cooling time is shorter than the local dissipation time. A somewhat\nsmaller radiative efficiency is expected if radiative losses are dominated by\nsynchrotron and SSC emissions. It is suggested that under certain conditions\nmagnetic field dissipation may occur in two distinct phases: On small scales,\nasymmetric magnetic fields that are advected into the polar region and dragged\nout by the outflow dissipate to a more stable configuration. The dissipated\nenergy is released predominantly as gamma rays. On much larger scales, the\noutflow encounters a flat density profile medium and re-collimates. This leads\nto further dissipation and wobbling of the jet head by the kink instability, as\nfound recently in 3D MHD simulations. Within the framework of a model proposed\nrecently to explain the dichotomy of radio loud AGN, this scenario can account\nfor the unification of gamma-ray blazars with FRI and FRII radio sources.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

Close to the protostars the CO polarization, at an angular\nresolution of $\\sim$$2\\farcs3$, has a position angle approximately parallel to\nthe magnetic field direction inferred from the dust polarizations. The CO\npolarization direction appears to vary smoothly from an hourglass field around\nthe core to an arc-like morphology wrapping around the outflow, suggesting a\nhelical structure of magnetic fields that inherits the poloidal fields at the\nlaunching point and consists of toroidal fields at a farther distance of\noutflow. The helical magnetic field is consistent with the theoretical\nexpectations for launching and collimating outflows from a magnetized rotating\ndisk. Considering that the CO polarized emission is mainly contributed from the\nlow-velocity and low-resolution data, the helical magnetic field is likely a\nproduct of the wind-envelope interaction in the wind-driven outflows. The CO\ndata reveal a PA of $\\sim$ 30$\\arcdeg$ deflection in the outflows. The\nvariation in the CO polarization angle seems to correlate with the deflections.\nWe speculate that the helical magnetic field contributes to $\\sim$ 10$\\arcdeg$\ndeflection of the outflows by means of Lorenz force.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures, ApJ Accepted"]}]

The system is also interesting with respect to a new\ntype of geometrical frustration in elemental crystals, which was found in\nbeta-rhombohedral boron. Based on density functional theory calculations, the\npresent study has resolved the structural and thermodynamic characteristics of\npure alpha-tetragonal boron. Different from beta-rhombohedral boron, the\nconditions for stable covalent bonding (a band gap and completely filled\nvalence bands) are almost fulfilled at a composition B_52 with two 4c\ninterstitial sites occupied. This indicates that the ground state of pure\nalpha-tetragonal boron is stoichiometric. However, the covalent condition is\nnot perfectly fulfilled because non-bonding in-gap states exist that cannot be\neliminated. The half occupation of the 4c sites yields a macroscopic amount of\nresidual entropy, which is as large as that of beta-rhombohedral boron.\nTherefore, alpha-tetragonal boron can be classified as an elemental crystal\nwith geometrical frustration. Deviations from stoichiometry can occur only at\nfinite temperatures. Thermodynamic considerations show that deviations delta\nfrom the stoichiometric composition B_(52+delta) are small and positive. For\nreported high-pressure syntheses conditions delta is predicted to be about 0.1\nto 0.2. An important difference between pure and C- or N-containing\nalpha-tetragonal boron is found in the occupation of interstitial sites: the\npure form prefers to occupy the 4c sites, whereas in C- or N-containing forms a\nmixture of 2a, 8h, and 8i sites are occupied.

To constrain the dust grain properties, we take Rosetta OSIRIS\nand GIADA results into account, and combine OSIRIS data during the approach\nphase (from late April to early June 2014) with a large data set of\nground-based images that were acquired with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT)\nfrom February to November 2014.

Key properties of the grains (density,\nvelocity, and size distribution) were obtained from Rosetta observations: these\nparameters were used as input of the code to considerably reduce the number of\nfree parameters. In this way, the overall dust mass-loss rate and its\ndependence on the heliocentric distance could be obtained accurately.

In this\npaper we present the deep photometry inside two square degrees around the\nbright galaxy NGC1399 in the core of the cluster. We found a very extended and\ndiffuse envelope surrounding the luminous galaxy NGC1399: we map the surface\nbrightness out to 33 arcmin (~ 192 kpc) from the galaxy center and down to\nabout 31 mag/arcsec^2 in the g band. The deep photometry allows us to detect a\nfaint stellar bridge in the intracluster region between NGC1399 and NGC1387. By\nanalyzing the integrated colors of this feature, we argue that it could be due\nto the ongoing interaction between the two galaxies, where the outer envelope\nof NGC1387 on its east side is stripped away.

We analyse the effect of accretion on the structure of a realistic\nstellar model of the young Sun.

This study focusses on the\nhigh accretion rates characteristic of FU Ori systems. We find that the highest\nentropy cases produce a distinctive behaviour in the mass redistribution, rms\nvelocities, and enthalpy flux in the convective envelope. This change in\nbehaviour is characterised by the formation of a hot layer on the surface of\nthe accreting object, which tends to suppress convection in the envelope.

The PWN shows strong jets and a faint torus within a\nlarger, more diffuse region of radio emission and nonthermal X-rays. Central\nsoft thermal X-ray emission is anticorrelated with the PWN; that, and more\ndetailed morphological evidence, indicates that the reverse shock has already\nreheated all ejecta and compressed the PWN.

Indication of wind\n  focusing"],"description":["  Context. The wind mass transfer from a giant to its white dwarf companion in\nsymbiotic binaries is not well understood. For example, the efficiency of wind\nmass transfer of the canonical Bondi-Hoyle accretion mechanism is too low to\npower the typical luminosities of the accretors. However, recent observations\nand modelling indicate a considerably more efficient mass transfer in symbiotic\nbinaries.\n  Aims. We determine the velocity profile of the wind from the giant at the\nnear-orbital-plane region of eclipsing S-type symbiotic binaries EG And and SY\nMus, and derive the corresponding spherical equivalent of the mass-loss rate.\nWith this approach, we indicate the high mass transfer ratio.\n  Methods. We achieved this aim by modelling the observed column densities\ntaking into account ionization of the wind of the giant, whose velocity profile\nis derived using the inversion of Abel's integral operator for the hydrogen\ncolumn density function.\n  Results. Our analysis revealed the spherical equivalent of the mass-loss rate\nfrom the giant to be a few times 10^{-6}M_{Sun}/yr, which is a factor of >=10\nhigher than rates determined by methods that do not depend on the line of\nsight. This discrepancy rules out the usual assumption that the wind is\nspherically symmetric. As our values were derived from near-orbital-plane\ncolumn densities, these values can be a result of focusing the wind from the\ngiant towards the orbital plane.\n  Conclusions. Our findings suggests that the wind from giants in S-type\nsymbiotic stars is not spherically symmetric, since it is enhanced at the\norbital plane and, thus, is accreted more effectively onto the hot component.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The existence of radio pulsations implies that the\nneutron star is currently not accreting. Substantial outflows from the\ncompanion render the radio pulsar undetectable for more than half of the orbit,\nand may contribute to the observed Halpha emission. Our initial pulsar\nobservations, together with the optically inferred orbit and inclination, imply\na mass ratio of 0.171+/-0.002, a companion mass of M_2=0.33+/-0.03 Msun, and a\nneutron star mass in the range 1.77<M_1<2.13 Msun. However, there remains a\ndiscrepancy between the distance of 4.4 kpc inferred from the optical\nproperties of the companion and the smaller radio dispersion measure distance\nof 1.6 kpc. The smaller distance would reduce the inferred Roche-lobe filling\nfactor, increase the inferred inclination angle, and decrease the masses. As a\nwide binary, PSR J1417-4402 differs from the radio-eclipsing black widow and\nredback pulsars being discovered in large numbers by Fermi. It is probably a\nsystem that began mass transfer onto the neutron star after the companion star\nleft the main sequence.

The peripheral rings display coherent features: their\neigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant\nstates. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of\ndisorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC,\nwhile the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site\ndisorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states,\ncreating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal\ntransfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder\nstrength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level\nsystem. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial\ncondition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an\nexcitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of\nthe order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the\ninitial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the\nsuperradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the\nsuperradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC\nenergy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an\noptimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the\nsuperradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap. The presence\nof dynamical noise, which induces dephasing and decoherence, affects the\nresonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional 'incoherent'\nresonance peak, which corresponds to the RC energy being equal to the energy of\nthe superradiant state.\n","Comment: This article shares part of the introduction and most of Section II\n  with arXiv:1508.01613, the remaining parts of the two articles treat\n  different problems"]}]

This technique is complementary to diffraction experiments\nand enables a precise determination of the point group symmetry of a crystal.\nBy combining our measurements with density functional theory calculations, we\nuncover a strong optical second harmonic response of bulk electric dipole\norigin from the Fe and Ca $3d$-derived states that enables us to assign $C_2$\nas the crystallographic point group. This makes the 112-type materials\nhigh-temperature superconductors without a center of inversion, allowing for\nthe possible mixing of singlet and triplet Cooper pairs in the superconducting\nstate. We also perform pump-probe transient reflectivity experiments that\nreveal a 4.6 THz phonon mode associated with the out-of-plane motion of As\natoms in the FeAs layers. We do not observe any suppression of the optical\nsecond harmonic response or shift in the phonon frequency upon cooling through\nthe reported monoclinic-to-triclinic transition at 58 K.

The dose strongly depends on both the\nangular sensitivity and on the visibility of a grating-based Talbot-Lau\ninterferometer. Using a conventional x-ray tube, a high sensitivity and a high\nvisibility are somewhat contradicting goals: To increase sensitivity, the\ngrating period has to be reduced and/or the grating distance increased.\nTechnically, this means using a higher Talbot order (3rd or 5th one instead of\nfirst one). This however reduces the visibility somewhat, because only a\nsmaller part of the tube spectrum will get used. This work proposes to relax\nthis problem by changing the phase grating geometry. This allows to double\nsensitivity (i.e., double the Talbot order) without reducing the visibility.\nOne proposed grating geometry is an older binary one (75% of a period\n$\\pi$-shifting), but applied in a novel way. The second proposed geometry is a\nnovel one, requiring three height levels for polychromatic correction. The\nadvantage is quantified by a simulation of the resulting interference patterns.\nVisibilities for the common $\\pi$-shifting gratings are compared with the\nproposed alternative geometries. This is done depending on photon energy and\nopening ratio of the coherence grating G0. It shows that despite of doubled\nsensitivity of the proposed gratings, the overall visibility might even improve\na little.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 8 figures, IEEE Medical Imaging conference, 2014, Seattle"]}]

The classical\naim in this context is to compute a control policy that maximizes the\nprobability of satisfying the specification. In many scenarios, there is\nhowever a non-zero probability of failure in every step of the system's\nexecution. For infinite-time horizon specifications, this implies that the\nspecification is violated with probability 1 in the long run no matter what\npolicy is chosen, which prevents previous policy computation methods from being\nuseful in these scenarios.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new optimization criterion for MDP policies\nthat captures the task of working towards the satisfaction of some\ninfinite-time horizon $\\omega$-regular specification.

Unlike\nexisting indoor localization systems, our approach does not require any\ntime-consuming and laborious site survey phase to characterize the radio\nsignals in the environment. To be precise, we construct the fingerprint map by\ncutting the layouts of the interested area into regions with only the knowledge\nof positions of APs. This can be done offline within a second and has a\npotential for practical use. The localization is then achieved by matching the\nordered AP-sequence to the ones in the fingerprint map. Different from\ntraditional fingerprinting that employing all APs information, we use only\nselected APs to perform localization, due to the fact that, without site\nsurvey, the possibility in obtaining the correct AP sequence is lower if it\ninvolves more APs. Experimental results show that, the proposed system achieves\nlocalization accuracy < 5m with an accumulative density function (CDF) of 50%\nto 60% depending on the density of APs. Furthermore, we observe that, using all\nAPs for localization might not achieve the best localization accuracy, e.g. in\nour case, 4 APs out of total 7 APs achieves the best performance.

By injecting frequency signals into one\nstabilized ring-like fiber network, the relative stabilities of 3.4e-14@1s for\na master clock dissemination and 5.1e-14@1s for a slave clock dissemination\nhave been achieved. The proposed scheme can greatly simplify the future 'N' to\n'N' time and frequency dissemination network, especially facing a multi-clock\ncomparison situation.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]
