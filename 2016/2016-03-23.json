This effect is non-negligible and must be accounted for in\nthe data reduction. Our paper establishes a wavelength calibration for OSIRIS\nTF with the accuracy required for spectrophotometric measurements using the\nfull field of view (FOV) of the instrument. The variation of the transmission\nwavelength $\\lambda(R)$ across the FOV is well described by\n$\\lambda(R)=\\lambda(0)/\\sqrt{1+(R/f_2)^2}$, where $\\lambda(0)$ is the central\nwavelength, $R$ represents the physical distance from the optical axis, and\n$f_2=185.70\\pm0.17\\,$mm is the effective focal length of the camera lens. This\nnew empirical calibration yields an accuracy better than 1\\,\\AA\\ across the\nentire OSIRIS FOV ($\\sim$8\\arcmin$\\times$8\\arcmin), provided that the position\nof the optical axis is known within 45 $\\mu$m ($\\equiv$ 1.5 binned pixels). We\nsuggest a calibration protocol to grant such precision over long periods, upon\nre-alignment of OSIRIS optics, and in different wavelength ranges. This\ncalibration differs from the calibration in OSIRIS manual which, nonetheless,\nprovides an accuracy $\\lesssim1$\\AA\\, for $R\\lesssim 2\\arcmin$.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in PASP"]}]

The internal energy of such systems lacks extensivity and\nadditivity. Although the extensivity can be restored by scaling the interaction\npotential with the number of particles, the non-additivity still remains. Lack\nof additivity leads to inequivalence of statistical ensembles. Before relaxing\nto thermodynamic equilibrium, isolated systems with LR forces become trapped in\nout-of-equilibrium quasi-stationary state (qSS), the lifetime of which diverges\nwith the number of particles. Therefore, in thermodynamic limit LR systems will\nnot relax to equilibrium. The qSSs are attained through the process of\ncollisionless relaxation. Density oscillations lead to particle-wave\ninteractions and excitation of parametric resonances. The resonant particles\nescape from the main cluster to form a tenuous halo.

While the diffusion forecasting method assumes the\navailability of a noise-free training data set observing the full state space\nof the dynamics, in real applications we often have only partial observations\nwhich are corrupted by noise. To alleviate these practical issues, following\nthe theory of embedology, the diffusion model is built using the\ndelay-embedding coordinates of the data.

Contextuality is defined as follows: one computes the minimal\npossible value $\\Delta_{0}$ for the sum of $\\Pr[V_{i}\\not=W_{i}]$ (over\n$i=1,...,n$) that is allowed by the individual distributions of $V_{i}$ and\n$W_{i}$; one computes the minimal possible value $\\Delta_{\\min}$ for the sum of\n$\\Pr[V_{i}\\not=W_{i}]$ across all possible couplings of (i.e., joint\ndistributions imposed on) the entire set of random variables\n$V_{1},W_{1},...,V_{n},W_{n}$ in the system; and the system is considered\ncontextual if $\\Delta_{\\min}>\\Delta_{0}$ (otherwise\n$\\Delta_{\\min}=\\Delta_{0}$). This definition has its justification in the\ngeneral approach dubbed Contextuality-by-Default, and it allows for measurement\nerrors and signaling among the measured properties. The conjecture proved in\nthis paper specifies the value of $\\Delta_{\\min}-\\Delta_{0}$ in terms of the\ndistributions of the measurement outcomes $(V_{i},W_{j})$.\n","Comment: To be published in Foundations of Physics"]}]

A voting model represents the way in which public perceptions are\nconveyed to voters. Our voting model is constructed by using two types of\nvoters--herders and independents--and two candidates. Independents conduct\nvoting based on their fundamental values; on the other hand, herders base their\nvoting on the number of previous votes. Hence, herders vote for the majority\ncandidates and obtain information relating to previous votes from their\nnetworks. We discuss the difference between the phases on which the networks\ndepend. Two kinds of phase transitions, an information cascade transition and a\nsuper-normal transition, were identified. The first of these is a transition\nbetween a state in which most voters make the correct choices and a state in\nwhich most of them are wrong. The second is a transition of convergence speed.\nThe information cascade transition prevails when herder effects are stronger\nthan the super-normal transition. In the BA and fitness models, the critical\npoint of the information cascade transition is the same as that of the random\nnetwork model. However, the critical point of the super-normal transition\ndisappears when these two models are used.

The gauging is\ncompleted into a generalisation of the Heisenberg group with either additional\nseven-brane gauge fields or R-R bulk gauge fields. The former case relies on\nhaving seven-brane fluxes, while the latter case requires torsion cohomology\nand is analysed in detail through the M-theory dual. Remarkably, the M-theory\nreduction yields an Abelian theory that becomes non-Abelian when translated\ninto the correct duality frame to perform the F-theory limit. The reduction\nshows that the gauge coupling function depends on the gauged scalars and\ntransforms non-trivially as required for the groups encountered. This field\ndependence agrees with the expectations for the kinetic mixing of seven-branes\nand is unchanged if the gaugings are absent.\n","Comment: 41 pages"]}]

By composing Kraus maps that act only\non two sites at a time, we show how the quantum-walk formalism can be applied\nto derive a reaction operator for the standard avian radical-pair reaction. Our\nreaction operator predicts a recombination dephasing rate consistent with\nrecent experiments [J. Chem. Phys. {\\bf 139}, 234309 (2013)], in contrast to\nprevious work by Jones and Hore [Chem. Phys. Lett. {\\bf 488}, 90 (2010)]. The\nstandard radical-pair reaction has conventionally been described by either a\nnormalised density operator incorporating both the radical pair and reaction\nproducts, or by a trace-decreasing density operator that considers only the\nradical pair. We demonstrate a density operator that is both normalised and\nrefers only to radical-pair states. Generalisations to include additional\ndephasing processes and an arbitrary number of sites are also discussed.\n"]}]

We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate\npolicy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers.

The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling\napproach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its\nuse in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption\nand diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3)\ninteractions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and\n(4) the anticipation of policy outcomes.

In any concrete implementation of PGM,\nthe SUSY-breaking field is therefore required to carry nonzero charge under\nsome global or local symmetry. As we point out in this note, a prime candidate\nfor such a symmetry might be B-L, the Abelian gauge symmetry associated with\nthe difference between baryon number B and lepton number L. The F-term of the\nSUSY-breaking field then not only breaks SUSY, but also B-L, which relates the\nrespective spontaneous breaking of SUSY and B-L at a fundamental level.

For spins, however,\nspontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative\nrelaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole\nand the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized that the spontaneous\nemission rate can be strongly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a\nresonant cavity -an effect which has since been used extensively to control the\nlifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave or\noptical cavities, underpinning single-photon sources. Here we report the first\napplication of these ideas to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in\nsilicon to a superconducting microwave cavity of high quality factor and small\nmode volume, we reach for the first time the regime where spontaneous emission\nconstitutes the dominant spin relaxation mechanism. The relaxation rate is\nincreased by three orders of magnitude when the spins are tuned to the cavity\nresonance, showing that energy relaxation can be engineered and controlled\non-demand. Our results provide a novel and general way to initialise spin\nsystems into their ground state, with applications in magnetic resonance and\nquantum information processing. They also demonstrate that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the\nelectromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point where quantum\nfluctuations have a dramatic effect on the spin dynamics; as such our work\nrepresents an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of\nindividual spins to microwave photons.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

We find very fast variability timescale during flares\n(of the order of hours) together with a significant gamma-ray flux increase. We\nshow that the 6.8 years averaged gamma-ray emission of 3C 120 is likely a sum\nof the external radiation Compton and the synchrotron self-Compton radiative\ncomponents. To address the problem of \"orphan\" gamma-ray flares and fast\nvariability we model the jet radiation dividing the jet structure into two\ncomponents: the wide and relatively slow outer layer and the fast, narrow\nspine. We show that with the addition of the fast spine occasionally bent\ntowards the observer we are able to explain observed spectral energy\ndistribution of 3C 120 during flares with the Compton up-scattered broad-line\nregion and dusty torus photons as main gamma-rays emission mechanism.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]}]

Such models generally assume the existence of\nStandard Model particles early on, with the DM relic density a later\nconsequence of those interactions. Perhaps a more compelling assumption is that\nDM is not part of the Standard Model sector and a population of DM too is\ngenerated at the end of inflation. This democratic assumption does not\nnecessarily provide a natural value for the DM relic density, and superficially\nleads to too much entropy in the dark sector.

We ask what it would\ntake for this scenario to be compatible with observations in what we call\nFlooded Dark Matter (FDM) and discuss several interesting consequences. One is\nthat DM can be very light and furthermore, light DM is in some sense the most\nnatural scenario in FDM as it is compatible with larger couplings of the\ndecaying particle. Moreover, the decay of the field with the smallest coupling\nand hence the longest lifetime dominates the entropy and possibly the matter\ncontent of the Universe, a principle we refer to as 'Maximum Baroqueness'. We\nalso show that the dark sector should be colder than the ordinary sector,\nrelaxing the free-streaming constraints on light DM. We will discuss the\nimplications for the core-cusp problem in a follow-up paper. FDM also has\ninteresting baryogenesis implications. One possibility is that both DM and\nbaryon asymmetries are simultaneously diluted by a late entropy dump.\nAlternatively, FDM is compatible with an elegant non-thermal leptogenesis\nimplementation in which decays of a heavy RH neutrino lead to late time\nreheating of the Standard Model and provide suitable conditions for creation of\na lepton asymmetry.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Simultaneously, the detector would record science\nquality data in between commissioning activities. As of early 2014, all of the\nplanned upgrades have been carried out and sensitivity improvements of up to a\nfactor of four at the high-frequency end of the observation band have been\nachieved. Besides science data collection, an experimental program is ongoing\nwith the goal to further improve the sensitivity and evaluate future detector\ntechnologies. We summarize the results of the GEO-HF program to date and\ndiscuss its successes and challenges.\n"]}]

At a 2-to-1 lane reduction,\nthe improvement in flow past a bottleneck due to traffic with a random mixture\nof 40% connected vehicles is found to be 52%. Control is based on\nconnected-vehicle-reported velocities near the bottleneck. In response to\nindications of congestion the connected vehicles, which are also adaptive\ncruise control vehicles, reduce their speed in slowdown regions. Early lane\nchanges of manually driven vehicles from the terminated lane to the continuous\nlane are induced by the slowing connected vehicles. Self-organized congestion\nat the bottleneck is thus delayed or eliminated, depending upon the incoming\nflow magnitude. For the large majority of vehicles, travel times past the\nbottleneck are substantially reduced. Control is responsible for delaying the\nonset of congestion as the incoming flow increases. Adaptive cruise control\nincreases the flow out of the congested state at the bottleneck. The nature of\nthe congested state, when it occurs, appears to be similar under a variety of\nconditions.

These atomic stress tensors can be used to describe\nliquids' structures and to investigate the connection between structural and\ndynamic properties. In particular, atomic stresses allow to address atomic\nscale correlations relevant to the Green-Kubo expression for viscosity.\nPreviously correlations between the atomic stresses of different atoms were\nstudied using the Cartesian representation of the stress tensors or the\nrepresentation based on spherical harmonics. In this paper we address\nstructural correlations in a model 3D binary liquid using the eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of the atomic stress tensors. Thus correlations relevant to the\nGreen-Kubo expression for viscosity are interpreted in a simple geometric way.\nOn decrease of temperature the changes in the relevant stress correlation\nfunction between different atoms are significantly more pronounced than the\nchanges in the pair density function. We demonstrate that this behaviour\noriginates from the orientational correlations between the eigenvectors of the\natomic stress tensors. We also found correlations between the eigenvalues of\nthe same atomic stress tensor. For the studied system, with purely repulsive\ninteractions between the particles, the eigenvalues of every atomic stress\ntensor are positive and they can be ordered: $\\lambda_1 \\geq \\lambda_2 \\geq\n\\lambda_3 \\geq 0$. We found that, for the particles of a given type, the\nprobability distributions of the ratios $(\\lambda_2/\\lambda_1)$ and\n$(\\lambda_3/\\lambda_2)$ are essentially identical to each other in the liquids\nstate.

However, the noncommutativity of the two measurements in quantum\nmechanics makes the extension of such a concept to the quantum regime\nimpossible. For this reason, quantum TST (QTST) has been generally accepted as\nany kind of quantum rate theory reproducing the TST in the classical limit, and\nthere has been a broad consensus that no unique QTST retaining all the\nproperties of TST can be defined. Hele and Althorpe (HA) [J. Chem.

This\nwork seeks to question and clarify certain assumptions underlying these\nsuggestions and their implications. First, the time correlation function used\nby HA as a starting expression is not related to the kinetic rate constant by\nvirtue of linear response theory, which is the first important step in relating\na t=0+ limit to a physically measurable rate. Second, a theoretical analysis\ncalls into question a key step in HA's proof which appears not to rely on an\nexact quantum mechanical identity. The correction of this makes the true t=0+\nlimit of HA's QTST different from the RPMD-TST rate expression, but rather\nequal to the well-known path integral quantum transition state theory rate\nexpression for the case of centroid dividing surface. An alternative path\nintegral quantum rate expression is then formulated based on the linear\nresponse theory.

To overcome computational restrictions, a ribbon of\nrelatively small width is simulated instead of the square specimen. It is\nfurther demonstrated that the heat conduction coefficient in the \"long\"\ndirection of the ribbon ceases to depend on the width, as the latter achieves\nonly 10 to 20 interparticle distances. So, one can consider the dynamics of\nmuch longer systems, than in the traditional setting, and still can gain a\nreliable information regarding the 2D lattice. It turns out that for all\nconsidered models, for which the conductivity is convergent in the 1D case, it\nis indeed convergent in the 2D case. In the same time, however, the length of\nthe system, necessary to reveal the convergence in the 2D case, may be much\nbigger than in its 1D counterpart.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Results obtained in\nthis study do not not depend on the specific decay channel of the LL particle\nand therefore are model-independent in this sense. We provide limits for the\nwhole two-dimensional plane in terms of the mass of the LL particle and the\nmass of the mediator up to masses of 2 TeV including particular benchmarks\nstudied in the original experimental papers. We have made these limits\navailable in the form of a grid which can be used for the interpretation of\nvarious other new physics models.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]

Here we develop a\nphysical model for the accretion flow which can accommodate all these features,\nwith an outer standard disc, which can make a transition to an energetically\ncoupled disc-corona region, and make a further transition to a hot inner flow\nwhich can be radiatively inefficient if required.

We examine whether the dispersion measures, fluences,\ninferred redshifts, signal-to-noises and effective widths of known FRBs are\nconsistent with a cosmological population. Statistical analyses indicate that\nat least 50 events at Parkes are required to distinguish between a constant\nco-moving FRB density, and a FRB density that evolves with redshift like the\ncosmological star formation rate density.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables"]}]

Using a maximum\nlikelihood approach, we jointly fit the stellar mass function and specific\naccretion rate distribution function, with the X-ray luminosity function as an\nadditional constraint. Our best fit model characterizes the SARDF as a double\npower-law with mass dependent but redshift independent break whose low\nlambda_SAR slope flattens with increasing redshift while the normalization\nincreases. This implies that, for a given stellar mass, higher lambda_SAR\nobjects have a peak in their space density at earlier epoch compared to the\nlower lambda_SAR ones, following and mimicking the well known AGN cosmic\ndownsizing as observed in the AGN luminosity function. The mass function of\nactive galaxies is described by a Schechter function with a almost constant\nMstar* and a low mass slope alpha that flattens with redshift. Compared to the\nstellar mass function, we find that the HGMF has a similar shape and that, up\nto log((Mstar/Msun)~11.5 the ratio of AGN host galaxies to star forming\ngalaxies is basically constant (~10%).

Our aim is to determine the frequency and orbital parameters of\nbinary systems among the CEMP-s stars, which exhibit strong enhancements of\nneutron-capture elements associated with the s-process. This allows us to test\nwhether local mass transfer from a binary companion is necessary and sufficient\nto explain their dramatic carbon excesses. Eighteen of the 22 stars exhibit\nclear orbital motion, yielding a binary frequency of 82+-10%, while four stars\nappear to be single (18+-10%). We thus confirm that the binary frequency of\nCEMP-s stars is much higher than for normal metal-poor giants, but not 100% as\npreviously claimed. Secure orbits are determined for 11 of the binaries and\nprovisional orbits for six long-period systems (P > 3,000 days), and orbital\ncircularisation time scales are discussed.

This allows to perform an\nensemble analysis of the spectral variability for a large sample of quasars. We\nquantify the spectral variability through the spectral variability parameter\n$\\beta$, defined as the ratio between the change in spectral slope and the\ncorresponding logarithmic flux variation. We find that the spectral variability\nof quasars has a softer when brighter behaviour, similarly to local AGNs.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures.

The absence of\nspurious intensity fluctuations moreover enabled measurement of a transition\nfrom exponential to Gaussian decay of the phase coherence of the polariton\nlaser. It suggests large self-interaction energies in the polariton condensate,\nexceeding the laser bandwidth.

To constrain the dust grain properties, we take Rosetta OSIRIS\nand GIADA results into account, and combine OSIRIS data during the approach\nphase (from late April to early June 2014) with a large data set of\nground-based images that were acquired with the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT)\nfrom February to November 2014.

In this way, the overall dust mass-loss rate and its\ndependence on the heliocentric distance could be obtained accurately.

In this\npaper we present the deep photometry inside two square degrees around the\nbright galaxy NGC1399 in the core of the cluster. We found a very extended and\ndiffuse envelope surrounding the luminous galaxy NGC1399: we map the surface\nbrightness out to 33 arcmin (~ 192 kpc) from the galaxy center and down to\nabout 31 mag/arcsec^2 in the g band. The deep photometry allows us to detect a\nfaint stellar bridge in the intracluster region between NGC1399 and NGC1387. By\nanalyzing the integrated colors of this feature, we argue that it could be due\nto the ongoing interaction between the two galaxies, where the outer envelope\nof NGC1387 on its east side is stripped away. By fitting the light profile, we\nfound that it exists a physical break radius in the total light distribution at\nR=10 arcmin (~58 kpc) that sets the transition region between the bright\ncentral galaxy and the outer exponential stellar halo. We discuss the main\nimplications of this work on the build-up of the stellar halo at the center of\nthe Fornax cluster. By comparing with the numerical simulations of the stellar\nhalo formation for the most massive BCGs, we find that the observed stellar\nhalo mass fraction is consistent with a halo formed through the multiple\naccretion of progenitors with a stellar mass in the range 10^8 - 10^11 M_sun.\nThis might suggest that the halo of NGC1399 has also gone through a major\nmerging event. The absence of a significant number of luminous stellar streams\nand tidal tails out to 192 kpc suggests that the epoch of this strong\ninteraction goes back to an early formation epoch.

The results of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) show peaks in the\npower spectrum at frequencies in the range from 2 to 8 mHz at four different\nheights (above the limb), while the wavelet analysis indicate dominant\nfrequencies similar to those of the Fourier power spectrum results. A coherency\nstudy indicates the presence of coherent oscillations at about 5.5 mHz (3 min).\nWe measure mean phase speeds in the range 250 to 425 km/s increasing with\nheight.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures, accepted in Sol.

One major motivation is to analyse\nthe validity of accretion treatment used in previous 1D stellar evolution\nstudies. We analyse the effect of accretion on the structure of a realistic\nstellar model of the young Sun. Our work is inspired by the numerical work of\nKley \\& Lin (1996, ApJ, 461, 933) devoted to the structure of the boundary\nlayer in accretion disks. We analyse the redistribution of accreted material\nwith a range of values of specific entropy relative to the bulk specific\nentropy of the material in the accreting object's convective envelope. A\nprimary goal is to understand whether and how accreted energy deposited onto a\nstellar surface is redistributed in the interior. This study focusses on the\nhigh accretion rates characteristic of FU Ori systems. We find that the highest\nentropy cases produce a distinctive behaviour in the mass redistribution, rms\nvelocities, and enthalpy flux in the convective envelope. This change in\nbehaviour is characterised by the formation of a hot layer on the surface of\nthe accreting object, which tends to suppress convection in the envelope. We\nanalyse the long-term effect of such a hot buffer zone on the structure and\nevolution of the accreting object with 1D stellar evolution calculations. We\nstudy the relevance of the assumption of redistribution of accreted energy into\nthe stellar interior used in the literature.

In many cases the\ndisk interior to 0.5-1 AU is cleared of embryos and most planetesimals. By\ngenerating a mass deficit close to the Sun, the outward migration of Jupiter's\ncore may thus explain the absence of terrestrial planets closer than Mercury.\nJupiter's migrating core often stimulates the growth of another large\n(~Earth-mass) core -- that may provide a seed for Saturn's core -- trapped in\nexterior resonance. The migrating core also may transport a fraction of\nterrestrial planetesimals, such as the putative parent bodies of iron\nmeteorites, to the asteroid belt.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures.

The smooth UV continuum of\nSN2011kl requires higher ejecta velocities (~20000 km/s): line blanketing leads\nto an almost featureless spectrum. Helium is observed in some SLSNe after\nmaximum. The high ionization near maximum implies that both He and H may be\npresent but not observed at early times. The spectroscopic classification of\nSLSNe should probably reflect that of SNe Ib/c.

By using a set of Monte Carlo\ncluster simulations evolved in quasi-isolation, we show that the stellar mass\ndependence of the velocity dispersion $\\sigma(m)$ can be described by an\nexponential function $\\sigma^2\\propto \\exp(-m/m_\\mathrm{eq})$, with the\nparameter $m_\\mathrm{eq}$ quantifying the degree of partial energy\nequipartition of the systems. This simple parametrization successfully captures\nthe behaviour of the velocity dispersion at lower as well as higher stellar\nmasses, that is, the regime where the system is expected to approach full\nequipartition. We find a tight correlation between the degree of equipartition\nreached by a GC and its dynamical state, indicating that clusters that are more\nthan about 20 core relaxation times old, have reached a maximum degree of\nequipartition. This equipartition$-$dynamical state relation can be used as a\ntool to characterize the relaxation condition of a cluster with a kinematic\nmeasure of the $m_\\mathrm{eq}$ parameter. Vice versa, the mass-dependence of\nthe kinematics can be predicted knowing the relaxation time solely on the basis\nof photometric measurements.

Drake et al. (2006) proposed a mechanism for accelerating electrons\nin contracting magnetic islands formed by kinetic reconnection in multi-layered\ncurrent sheets. We apply these ideas to sunward-moving flux ropes (2.5D\nmagnetic islands) formed during fast reconnection in a simulated eruptive\nflare. A simple analytic model is used to calculate the energy gain of\nparticles orbiting the field lines of the contracting magnetic islands in our\nultrahigh-resolution 2.5D numerical simulation.

In order to increase their energy by two orders of\nmagnitude and plausibly account for the observed high-energy flare emission,\nthe electrons must visit multiple contracting islands. This mechanism should\nproduce sporadic emission because island formation is intermittent. Moreover, a\nlarge number of particles could be accelerated in each\nmagnetohydrodynamic-scale island, which may explain the inferred rates of\nenergetic-electron production in flares.

The peripheral rings display coherent features: their\neigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant\nstates. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of\ndisorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC,\nwhile the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site\ndisorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states,\ncreating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal\ntransfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder\nstrength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level\nsystem. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial\ncondition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an\nexcitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of\nthe order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the\ninitial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the\nsuperradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the\nsuperradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC\nenergy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an\noptimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the\nsuperradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap. The presence\nof dynamical noise, which induces dephasing and decoherence, affects the\nresonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional 'incoherent'\nresonance peak, which corresponds to the RC energy being equal to the energy of\nthe superradiant state.\n","Comment: This article shares part of the introduction and most of Section II\n  with arXiv:1508.01613, the remaining parts of the two articles treat\n  different problems"]}]

Smooth haptic\nfeedback is an important task for haptic rendering with complex virtual\nobjects. However, commonly the update rate of the haptic rendering may drop\ndown during multi-point contact in complex scenarios because high computational\ncost is required for collision detection and physically-based dynamic\nsimulation. If the haptic rendering is done at a lower update rate, it may\ncause discontinuous or instable force/torque feedback. Therefore, to implement\nsmooth and accurate haptic rendering, the update rate of force/torque\ncalculation should be kept in a high and constant frequency. In the proposed\nmethod, the auto-regressive model with real-time coefficients update is\nproposed to predict interactive forces/torques during the physical simulation.\nIn addition, we introduce a spline function to dynamically interpolate smooth\nforces/torques in haptic display according to the update rate of physical\nsimulation. In the experiments, we show the feasibility of the proposed method\nand compare its performance with other methods and algorithms. The result shows\nthat the proposed method can provide smooth and accurate haptic force feedback\nat a high update rate for complex scenarios.\n"]}]

Unlike\nexisting indoor localization systems, our approach does not require any\ntime-consuming and laborious site survey phase to characterize the radio\nsignals in the environment. To be precise, we construct the fingerprint map by\ncutting the layouts of the interested area into regions with only the knowledge\nof positions of APs. This can be done offline within a second and has a\npotential for practical use. The localization is then achieved by matching the\nordered AP-sequence to the ones in the fingerprint map. Different from\ntraditional fingerprinting that employing all APs information, we use only\nselected APs to perform localization, due to the fact that, without site\nsurvey, the possibility in obtaining the correct AP sequence is lower if it\ninvolves more APs. Experimental results show that, the proposed system achieves\nlocalization accuracy < 5m with an accumulative density function (CDF) of 50%\nto 60% depending on the density of APs. Furthermore, we observe that, using all\nAPs for localization might not achieve the best localization accuracy, e.g. in\nour case, 4 APs out of total 7 APs achieves the best performance.

An\ninformation theoretic model of noisy computation of a perfect function f\n(measurable function between sequence spaces) thanks to an unreliable device\n(random channel) F is given: a noisy computation is a product fxF of channels.\nA model of reliable computation based on input encoding and output decoding is\nalso proposed. These models extend those of noisy communication channel and of\nreliable communication through a noisy channel. The capacity of a noisy\ncomputation is defined and justified by a coding theorem and a converse. Under\nsome constraints on the encoding process, capacity is the upper bound of input\nrates allowing reliable computation, i.e. decodability of noisy outputs into\nexpected outputs. These results hold when the one-sided random processes under\nconcern are asymptotic mean stationary (AMS) and ergodic. In addition, some\ncharacterizations of AMS and ergodic noisy computations are given based on\nstability properties of the perfect function f and of the random channel F.\nThese results are derived from the more general framework of channel products.\nFinally, a way to apply the noisy and reliable computation models to cases\nwhere the perfect function f is defined according to a formal computational\nmodel is proposed.\n"]}]

After estimating the period of the oscillations induced on the\ngalaxies by the tidal field of the cluster, we discuss the possible effect of\nresonances between stellar orbits inside the galaxy and the oscillations of the\ngalaxy as a whole; this may be a mechanism responsible for producing an\nintracluster stellar population.\n","Comment: 20 pages LaTeX file, plus 5 .(e)ps figures and macro celmec.sty --\n  Celestial Mechanics, in press"]}]

Detailed models of feedback modulated\n  accretion flows"],"description":["  Most elliptical galaxies contain central black holes (BHs), and most also\ncontain significant amounts of hot gas capable of accreting on to the central\nBH due to cooling times short compared to the Hubble time. Why therefore do we\nnot see AGNs at the center of most elliptical galaxies rather than in only (at\nmost) a few per cent of them? We propose here the simple idea that feedback\nfrom accretion events heats the ambient gas retarding subsequent infall. In\nthis context, we present a class of 1D hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences\nfor the gas flows in elliptical galaxies with a massive central BH. The\nresulting evolution is characterized by strong oscillations, in which very fast\nand energetic bursts of the BH are followed by longer periods in which the\nX-ray galaxy emission comes from the coronal gas. We also allow for departures\nfrom spherical symmetry by examining scenarios in which the central engine is\neither an ADAF or a more conventional accretion disk that is optically thick\nexcept for a polar region. In all cases the duty cycle (fraction of the time\nthat the system will be seen as an AGN) is quite small and in the range 10^{-4}\n- 10^{-3}. Thus, for any reasonable value of the efficiency, the presence of a\nmassive BH at the center of a galaxy seems to be incompatible with the presence\nof a long-lived cooling flow.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 10 figures.

In bulk\nsuperconductors, this reduction of flux becomes negligible already at submicron\ndistances from the edge but, in thin films, the effect may survive at much\nlarger distances. In the absence of any experimental observation, such flux\nreduction is perceived to be an exotic or unimportant effect, and it is often\nassumed that magnetic field enters type-II superconductors in units of f0. Here\nwe report the measurements of the amount of flux associated with the entrance\nof individual vortices in a superconducting film and show that the flux that\nthey bring in, always differs substantially from f0. We have observed vortices\nthat carry as little as 0.001 f0 as well as seemingly \"negative vortices\" whose\npenetration leads to the expulsion of magnetic field. We distinguish two\nphenomena responsible for non-quantized flux penetration: the finite-size\neffect and a non-linear screening of magnetic field in the presence of a\nsurface barrier. The latter effect has previously not been considered but is\nlikely to cause non-quantized penetration in many cases.\n","Comment: pdf-file of a slighly longer version than appeared in Nature"]}]
