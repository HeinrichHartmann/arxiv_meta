The linear threshold model has been introduced to study the opinion\ncascading behavior, for instance, the spread of products and innovations. In\nthis paper, we we extends the classic linear threshold model [18] to capture\nthe non-progressive be- havior. The information maximization problem under our\nmodel is proved to be NP-Hard, even for the case when the underlying network\nhas no directed cycles. The first result of this paper is negative. In general,\nthe objective function of the extended linear threshold model is no longer\nsubmodular, and hence the hill climbing approach that is commonly used in the\nexisting studies is not applicable. Next, as the main result of this paper, we\nprove that if the underlying information network is directed acyclic, the\nobjective function is submodular (and monotone). Therefore, in directed acyclic\nnetworks with a specified budget we can achieve 1/2 -approximation on\nmaximizing the number of active nodes over a certain period of time by a\ndeterministic algorithm, and achieve the (1 - 1/e )-approximation by a\nrandomized algorithm.\n"]}]
