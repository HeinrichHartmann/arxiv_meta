These algebras are in fact\nperiodic, meaning that they have periodic projective resolutions as bimodules\nand thus periodic Hochschild cohomology as well. The goal of this article is to\ngeneralize this construction of periodic algebras to the context of Iyama's\nhigher AR-theory. We start by considering projective resolutions of functors on\na maximal (d-1)-orthogonal subcategory C of an exact Frobenius category B.

We show that, in this particular setting, the most\ngeneral adaptive discrimination strategies provide no asymptotic advantage over\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategies. This conclusion follows by proving a\nquantum Stein's lemma for this channel discrimination setting, showing that a\nconstant bound on the Type I error leads to the Type II error decreasing to\nzero exponentially quickly at a rate determined by the maximum relative entropy\nregistered between the channels. The strong converse part of the lemma states\nthat any attempt to make the Type II error decay to zero at a rate faster than\nthe channel relative entropy implies that the Type I error necessarily\nconverges to one. We then refine this latter result by identifying the optimal\nstrong converse exponent for this task. As a consequence of these results, we\ncan establish a strong converse theorem for the quantum-feedback-assisted\ncapacity of a channel, sharpening a result due to Bowen. Furthermore, our\nchannel discrimination result demonstrates the asymptotic optimality of a\nnon-adaptive tensor-power strategy in the setting of quantum illumination, as\nwas used in prior work on the topic.

The\nreduced Palm target point process is introduced to define the conditional\ntarget point process given the state of one or more known targets.

The walkers hop between neighboring nodes, until they\nreach a dead-end node from which they cannot proceed. Focusing on\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi networks we show that the pruned networks maintain a Poisson\ndegree distribution, $p_t(k)$, with an average degree, $\\langle k \\rangle_t$,\nthat decreases linearly in time. We enumerate the SAW paths of any given length\nand find that the number of paths, $n_T(\\ell)$, increases dramatically as a\nfunction of $\\ell$. We also obtain analytical results for the path-length\ndistribution, $P(\\ell)$, of the SAW paths which are actually pursued, starting\nfrom a random initial node. It turns out that $P(\\ell)$ follows the Gompertz\ndistribution, which means that the termination probability of an SAW path\nincreases with its length.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 11 figures"]}]

These codes are analyzed\nwith statistical models, often called emulators. In many situations, the\nphysical system (computer model output) may be known to satisfy inequality\nconstraints with respect to some or all input variables. Our aim is to build a\nmodel capable of incorporating both data interpolation and inequality\nconstraints into a Gaussian process emulator. By using a functional\ndecomposition, we propose to approximate the original Gaussian process by a\nfinite-dimensional Gaussian process such that all conditional simulations\nsatisfy the inequality constraints in the whole domain. The mean, mode (maximum\na posteriori) and prediction intervals (uncertainty quantification) of the\nconditional Gaussian process are calculated. To investigate the performance of\nthe proposed model, some conditional simulations with inequality constraints\nsuch as boundary, monotonicity or convexity conditions are given. 1.\nIntroduction. In the engineering activity, runs of a computer code can be\nexpensive and time-consuming. One solution is to use a statistical surrogate\nfor conditioning computer model outputs at some input locations (design\npoints). Gaussian process (GP) emulator is one of the most popular choices\n[23]. The reason comes from the property of the GP that uncertainty\nquantification can be calculated. Furthermore, it has several nice properties.\nFor example, the conditional GP at observation data (linear equality\nconstraints) is still a GP [5]. Additionally, some inequality constraints (such\nas monotonicity and convexity) of output computer responses are related to\npartial derivatives. In such cases, the partial derivatives of the GP are also\nGPs. Incorporating an infinite number of linear inequality constraints into a\nGP emulator, the problem becomes more difficult. The reason is that the\nresulting conditional process is not a GP. In the literature of interpolation\nwith inequality constraints, we find two types of meth-ods. The first one is\ndeterministic and based on splines, which have the advantage that the\ninequality constraints are satisfied in the whole input domain (see e.g. [16],\n[24] and [25]). The second one is based on the simulation of the conditional GP\nby using the subdivision of the input set (see e.g. [1], [6] and [11]). In that\ncase, the inequality constraints are satisfied in a finite number of input\nlocations. Notice that the advantage of such method is that un-certainty\nquantification can be calculated. In previous work, some methodologies have\nbeen based on the knowledge of the derivatives of the GP at some input\nlocations ([11], [21] and [26]). For monotonicity constraints with noisy data,\na Bayesian approach was developed in [21]. In [11] the problem is to build a GP\nemulator by using the prior monotonicity\n"]}]

First, to describe driver path-tracking styles, vehicle\nspeed and throttle opening are selected as the discriminative parameters, and a\nconditional kernel density function of vehicle speed and throttle opening is\nbuilt, respectively, to describe the uncertainty and probability of two\nrepresentative driving styles, e.g., aggressive and normal. Meanwhile, a\nposterior probability of each element in feature vector is obtained using full\nBayesian theory. Second, a Euclidean distance method is involved to decide to\nwhich class the driver should be subject instead of calculating the complex\ncovariance between every two elements of feature vectors. By comparing the\nEuclidean distance between every elements in feature vector, driving styles are\nclassified into seven levels ranging from low normal to high aggressive.\nSubsequently, to show benefits of the proposed pattern-recognition method, a\ncross-validated method is used, compared with a fuzzy logic-based\npattern-recognition method. The experiment results show that the proposed\nstatistical pattern-recognition method for driving styles based on kernel\ndensity estimation is more efficient and stable than the fuzzy logic-based\nmethod.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures.

However, most of the existing methods for dehazing are designed\nfor daytime images, and cannot always work well in the nighttime. Different\nfrom the imaging conditions in the daytime, images captured in nighttime haze\ncondition may suffer from non-uniform illumination due to artificial light\nsources, which exhibit low brightness/contrast and color distortion. In this\npaper, we present a new nighttime hazy imaging model that takes into account\nboth the non-uniform illumination from artificial light sources and the\nscattering and attenuation effects of haze. Accordingly, we propose an\nefficient dehazing algorithm for nighttime hazy images. The proposed algorithm\nincludes three sequential steps. i) It enhances the overall brightness by\nperforming a gamma correction step after estimating the illumination from the\noriginal image. ii) Then it achieves a color-balance result by performing a\ncolor correction step after estimating the color characteristics of the\nincident light. iii) Finally, it remove the haze effect by applying the dark\nchannel prior and estimating the point-wise environmental light based on the\nprevious illumination-balance result.

Therefore, most\nmetrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global. These\nmetrics produce a score for each community, not for each individual node. In\nthis paper, we argue that the belongingness of nodes in a community is not\nuniform.\n  The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength\nof membership of a vertex to a community depends upon two factors: (i) the the\nextent of connections of the vertex within its community versus outside its\ncommunity, and (ii) how tightly the vertex is connected internally. We discuss\nhow permanence can help us understand and utilize the structure and evolution\nof communities by demonstrating that it can be used to -- (i) measure the\npersistence of a vertex in a community, (ii) design strategies to strengthen\nthe community structure, (iii) explore the core-periphery structure within a\ncommunity, and (iv) select suitable initiators for message spreading.\n  We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful\ncommunities that concur with the ground-truth community structure of the\nnetworks more accurately than eight other popular community detection\nalgorithms.

Phylogenetic Classification"],"description":["  Phylogenetic approaches to classification have been heavily developed in\nbiology by bioinformaticians. But these techniques have applications in other\nfields, in particular in linguistics. Their main characteristics is to search\nfor relationships between the objects or species in study, instead of grouping\nthem by similarity. They are thus rather well suited for any kind of\nevolutionary objects. For nearly fifteen years, astrocladistics has explored\nthe use of Maximum Parsimony (or cladistics) for astronomical objects like\ngalaxies or globular clusters. In this lesson we will learn how it works. 1 Why\nphylogenetic tools in astrophysics? 1.1 History of classification The need for\nclassifying living organisms is very ancient, and the first classification\nsystem can be dated back to the Greeks. The goal was very practical since it\nwas intended to distinguish between eatable and toxic aliments, or kind and\ndangerous animals. Simple resemblance was used and has been used for centuries.\nBasically, until the XVIIIth century, every naturalist chose his own criterion\nto build a classification. At the end, hundreds of classifications were\navailable, most often incompatible to each other. The criteria for this\ntraditional way of classifying is the subjective appearance of the living\norganisms. During the XVIIIth a revolution occurred. Scientists like Adanson\nand Linn{\\'e} devised new ways of classifying the objects and naming the\nclasses. Adanson realised that all the observable traits should be used, giving\nbirth to the mutivariate clustering and classification activity (Adanson,\n1763). Linn{\\'e} based his binomial nomenclature on neutral names unrelated\nwhatsoever to any property of the classes. We can realise the success of these\ntwo ideas more than two centuries and a half later!\n"]}]

In microgrids, as the small-scale version of\ntraditional power grid, however, the EV charging scheduling is more\nchallenging. This is because, the microgrid owner, as a large electricity\ncustomer, is interested in shaving its global peak demand, i.e., the aggregated\ndemand over multiple parking stations, to reduce total electricity cost. While\nthe EV charging scheduling problem in single station scenario has been studied\nextensively in the previous research, the microgrid-level problem with multiple\nstations subject to a global peak constraint is not tackled. This paper aims to\npropose a near-optimal EV charging scheduling mechanism in a microgrid governed\nby a single utility provider with multiple charging stations. The goal is to\nmaximize the total revenue while respecting both local and global peak\nconstraints.
