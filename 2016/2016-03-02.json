We identify\nthat incorrect estimates of stellar metallicity and extinction could account\nfor these anomalies, rather than astrophysical effects such as eccentric\nexoplanets improbably transiting near apastron. Third, we find that the median\ntransit duration is correlated with stellar radius, when no such trend is\nexpected. All three effects are still present, although less pronounced, when\nconsidering only multiple transiting KOI systems which are thought to have a\nlow false positive rate. Improved stellar parameters for KOIs are necessary for\nthe validity of future ensemble tests of exoplanetary systems found by Kepler.\n","Comment: PASP, in press"]}]

We\nconsider disc temperature profile models that might match these observations.\nNixon and colleagues have suggested that misaligned accretion discs around\nspinning black holes will be disrupted at radii small enough for the\nLense-Thirring torque to overcome the disc's viscous torque. Gas in precessing\nannuli torn off a disc will spread radially and intersect with the remaining\ndisc, heating the disc at potentially large radii. However, if the intersection\noccurs at an angle of more than a degree or so, highly supersonic collisions\nwill shock-heat the gas to a Compton temperature of T~10^7 K, and the spectral\nenergy distributions (SEDs) of discs with such shock-heated regions are poor\nfits to observations of quasar SEDs. Torn discs where heating occurs in\nintermittent weak shocks that occur whenever the intersection angle reaches a\ntenth of a degree pose less of a conflict with observations, but do not have\nsignificantly larger half-light radii than standard discs. We also study two\nphenomenological disc temperature profile models. We find that discs with a\ntemperature spike at relatively large radii and lowered temperatures at radii\ninside the spike yield improved and acceptable fits to microlensing sizes in\nmost cases. Such temperature profiles could in principle occur in sub-Keplerian\ndiscs partially supported by magnetic pressure. However, such discs overpredict\nthe fluxes from quasars studied with microlensing except in the limit of\nnegligible continuum emission from radii inside the temperature spike.\n","Comment: Submitted to MNRAS.

In order\nto solve this problem, astrochemists have proposed that a fraction of molecules\nsynthesized on the surface of dust grains could desorb just after their\nformation. Recently the chemical desorption process has been demonstrated\nexperimentally, but the key parameters at play have not yet been fully\nunderstood. In this article we propose a new procedure to analyze the ratio of\ndi-oxygen and ozone synthesized after O atoms adsorption on oxidized graphite.\nWe demonstrate that the chemical desorption efficiency of the two reaction\npaths (O+O and O+O$_2$) is different by one order of magnitude. We show the\nimportance of the surface coverage: for the O+O reaction, the chemical\ndesorption efficiency is close to 80 $\\%$ at zero coverage and tends to zero at\none monolayer coverage. The coverage dependence of O+O chemical desorption is\nproved by varying the amount of pre-adsorbed N$_2$ on the substrate from 0 to\n1.5 ML. Finally, we discuss the relevance of the different physical parameters\nthat could play a role in the chemical desorption process: binding energy,\nenthalpy of formation, and energy transfer from the new molecule to the surface\nor to other adsorbates.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 8 figure, in press in JCP July 2014, Volume 141, Issue 2"]}]

To solve the dynamics of the ensemble system we\nintroduce a method for dissipative perturbation theory that applies average\nHamiltonian theory in an imaginary-time dissipative interaction frame to find\nan average effective dissipator for the system dynamics. We use SU(4) algebra\ngenerators to analytically solve the first order perturbation for an arbitrary\nnumber of qubits in the ensemble.

This broad agreement provides\nsupport to dust scattering as a viable mechanism for producing, at least in\npart, polarized millimeter radiation. In order to produce polarization at the\nobserved level ($\\sim 1\\%$), the scattering grains must have grown to a maximum\nsize of tens of microns. However, such grains may be too small to produce the\nopacity spectral index of $\\beta \\lesssim 1$ observed in HL Tau and other\nsources; another population of larger, millimeter/centimeter-sized, grains may\nbe needed to explain the bulk of the unpolarized continuum emission.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

However, many factors can significantly\nimpact their late-time cosmological abundances. For example, in cases where the\npotentials for these fields are generated dynamically --- such as during\ncosmological mass-generating phase transitions --- the duration of the time\ninterval required for these potentials to fully develop can have significant\nrepercussions. Likewise, in scenarios with multiple scalars, mixing amongst the\nfields can also give rise to an effective timescale that modifies the resulting\nlate-time abundances. Previous studies have focused on the effects of either\nthe first or the second timescale in isolation. In this paper, by contrast, we\nexamine the new features that arise from the interplay between these two\ntimescales when both mixing and time-dependent phase transitions are introduced\ntogether. First, we find that the effects of these timescales can conspire to\nalter not only the total late-time abundance of the system --- often by many\norders of magnitude --- but also its distribution across the different fields.\nSecond, we find that these effects can produce large parametric resonances\nwhich render the energy densities of the fields highly sensitive to the degree\nof mixing as well as the duration of the time interval over which the phase\ntransition unfolds. Finally, we find that these effects can even give rise to a\n\"re-overdamping\" phenomenon which causes the total energy density of the system\nto behave in novel ways that differ from those exhibited by pure dark matter or\nvacuum energy. All of these features therefore give rise to new possibilities\nfor early-universe phenomenology and cosmological evolution.

In this work, we use a sequence of laser pulses to resonantly\ngenerate a coherent superposition of excitons (Coulomb-bound electron-hole\npairs) in opposite valleys of monolayer WSe$_2$. The imposed valley coherence\npersists for approximately one hundred femtoseconds. We propose that the\nelectron-hole exchange interaction provides an important decoherence mechanism\nin addition to exciton population decay. Our work provides critical insight\ninto the requirements and strategies for optical manipulation of the valley\npseudospin for future valleytronics applications.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The search covered the full sky, a frequency range between 20 Hz and\n128 Hz with a range of spin-down between $-1.0 \\times 10^{-10}$ Hz/s and $+1.5\n\\times 10^{-11}$ Hz/s, and was based on a hierarchical approach. The starting\npoint was a set of short Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), of length 8192 seconds,\nbuilt from the calibrated strain data. Aggressive data cleaning, both in the\ntime and frequency domains, has been done in order to remove, as much as\npossible, the effect of disturbances of instrumental origin. On each dataset a\nnumber of candidates has been selected, using the FrequencyHough transform in\nan incoherent step. Only coincident candidates among VSR2 and VSR4 have been\nexamined in order to strongly reduce the false alarm probability, and the most\nsignificant candidates have been selected. The criteria we have used for\ncandidate selection and for the coincidence step greatly reduce the harmful\neffect of large instrumental artifacts. Selected candidates have been subject\nto a follow-up by constructing a new set of longer FFTs followed by a further\nincoherent analysis. No evidence for continuous gravitational wave signals was\nfound, therefore we have set a population-based joint VSR2-VSR4 90$\\%$\nconfidence level upper limit on the dimensionless gravitational wave strain in\nthe frequency range between 20 Hz and 128 Hz. This is the first all-sky search\nfor continuous gravitational waves conducted at frequencies below 50 Hz. We set\nupper limits in the range between about $10^{-24}$ and $2\\times 10^{-23}$ at\nmost frequencies. Our upper limits on signal strain show an improvement of up\nto a factor of $\\sim$2 with respect to the results of previous all-sky searches\nat frequencies below $80~\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 19 figures"]}]

These are particularly effective for models of\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) in presence of $R$-parity conservation, owing to the\npresence in their spectra of a stable neutralino as dark matter candidate. We\nassume here as theoretical framework Supersymmetric ($B-L$) extension of the\nStandard Model (BLSSM), wherein a mediator for invisible decays can be $Z'$\nboson. The peculiarity of the signal is thus that the final state objects carry\na very large (transverse) missing energy, since the $Z'$ is naturally massive\nand constrained by direct searches and electro-weak precision tests to be at\nleast in TeV scale region. Under these circumstances the efficiency in\naccessing the invisible final state and rejecting the standard model background\nis very high. This somehow compensates the rather meagre production rates.\nAnother special feature of this invisible BLSSM signal is its composition,\nwhich is often dominated by sneutrino decays (alongside the more traditional\nneutrino and neutralino modes). Sensitivity of the CERN machine to these two\nfeatures can therefore help disentangling the BLSSM from more popular SUSY\nmodels. We assess in this analysis the scope of the LHC in establishing the\naforementioned invisible signals through a sophisticated signal-to-background\nsimulation carried out in presence of parton shower, hadronisation and detector\neffects. We find that significant sensitivity exists already after 300\nfb$^{-1}$ during Run 2.

At a critical\nvalue, the self-induced Zeeman field at the Dirac points of the dispersion\nbecomes equal to the real Zeeman field and then exceeds it. The gap is thus\nclosed and then re-opened with inverted Chern numbers. This change of topology\nis accompanied by a change of the propagation directions of the one-way edge\nmodes. This result demonstrates that the chirality of a topological insulator\ncan be reversed by collective effects in a Bose-Einstein condensate.\n"]}]

We investigate using\na statistically-controlled stacking analysis as a function of (stellar mass, UV\nslope) the dispersion of the IRX-UVslope and IRX-M* plane. Our results enable\nus to study the average relation between star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar\nmass, and we show that our LBG sample lies on the main sequence of star\nformation at z~3.\n","Comment: Accepted to A&A, 17 Pages, 14 Figures, 2 Tables"]}]

Growing from micrometre-sized dust and ice particles to\nkm-sized objects is, however, difficult because of growth barriers and time\nscale constraints. The gravitational collapse of pebble clouds that formed\nthrough the streaming instability may provide a suitable mechanism for comet\nformation.\n  We study the collisional compression of cm-sized porous ice/dust-mixed\npebbles in collapsing pebble clouds.

The mean square charge radius is calculated,\n<r^2_rho>=(0.56+-0.04) fm^2. This result verifies, for the rho-meson case, the\nconjecture of equality between electromagnetic and strong radii of hadrons\ntested previously for proton, pi and K mesons.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures, revtex"]}]

Multiple road tests are conducted around Wheatley, Oxford to\ngather results and emulate the crowdsourcing approach. By extracting parked\nvehicles' features from the collected trace, a supervised learning algorithm is\ndeveloped to estimate roadside parking occupancy and spot illegal parking\nvehicles. A quantity estimation model is derived to calculate the required\nnumber of sensing units to cover urban streets. The estimation is\nquantitatively compared to a fixed sensing solution. The results show that the\ncrowdsourcing way would need substantially fewer sensors compared to the fixed\nsensing system.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The telescope is designed to deliver high efficiency images at that\nwavelength with a total 1/2 wavefront error of about 10 microns. With a 20 arc\nmin field of view, CCAT will be able to accommodate large format bolometer\narrays and will excel at carrying out surveys as well as resolving structures\nto the 2 arc sec. resolution level. The telescope will be an ideal complement\nto ALMA. Initial instrumentation will include both a wide field bolometer\ncamera and a medium resolution spectrograph. Studies of the major telescope\nsubsystems have been performed as part of an initial Feasibility Concept Study.\nNovel aspects of the telescope design include kinematic mounting and active\npositioning of primary mirror segments, high bandwidth secondary mirror segment\nmotion control for chopping, a Calotte style dome of 50 meter diameter, a mount\ncapable of efficient scanning modes of operation, and some new approaches to\npanel manufacture. Analysis of telescope performance and of key subsystems will\nbe presented to illustrate the technical feasibility and pragmatic cost of\nCCAT.
