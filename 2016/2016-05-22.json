First,\ncomputed tomography (CT) scans are carried out on the samples to generate 3D\ngrayscale images. Then, a preliminary analysis is conducted to evaluate key\nquantities associated with the porosity, such as void fraction, pore volume,\nconnectivity, and surface area. Finally, the samples are successfully\nidentified and separated into two different structure families by using the\nMFA. A new software (Munari) to carry out the MFA of 3D grayscale images is\nalso presented.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 tables, 3 figures"]}]
