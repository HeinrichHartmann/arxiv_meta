Within\nthe context of First-Order Irreversible Thermodynamics (FOIT), in this work we\nshow that for an energy converter consisting of two coupled fluxes it is also\npossible to find loop-shaped curves of both power output and the so-called\necological function against efficiency. In a previous work Stucki [J.W. Stucki,\nEur. J. Biochem. vol. 109, 269 (1980)] used a FOIT-approach to describe the\nmodes of thermodynamic performance of oxidative phosphorylation involved in\nATP-synthesis within mithochondrias. In that work the author did not use the\nmentioned loop-shaped curves and he proposed that oxidative phosphorylation\noperates in a steady state simultaneously at minimum entropy production and\nmaximum efficiency, by means of a conductance matching condition between\nextreme states of zero and infinite conductances respectively. In the present\nwork we show that all Stucki's results about the oxidative phosphorylation\nenergetics can be obtained without the so-called conductance matching\ncondition. On the other hand, we also show that the minimum entropy production\nstate implies both null power output and efficiency and therefore this state is\nnot fulfilled by the oxidative phosphorylation performance. Our results suggest\nthat actual efficiency values of oxidative phosphorylation performance are\nbetter described by a mode of operation consisting in the simultaneous\nmaximization of the so-called ecological function and the efficiency.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phys.

We derive Markovian kinetic equations for the\nensemble-averaged state of the SQD-qubit system, expressed in the coupled\ndynamics of two charge-state occupations of the SQD and two qubit isospin\nvectors, one for each SQD charge state. We find that aside from introducing\ndissipation, the detection also renormalizes the coherent evolution of the\nSQD-qubit system. Basically, if the electron on the detector has time to probe\nthe qubit, then it also has time to fluctuate and thereby renormalize the\nsystem parameters. In particular, this induces torques on the qubit isospins,\nsimilar to the spin torque generated by the spintronic exchange field in\nnoncollinear spin-valve structures. Secondly, we show that for a consistent\ndescription of the detection, one must also include the renormalization effects\nin the next-to-leading order in the electron tunneling rates, especially at the\npoint of maximal sensitivity of the detector. Although we focus on a\ncharge-qubit model, our findings are generic for qubit readout schemes that are\nbased on spin-to-charge conversion using a quantum-dot detector. Furthermore,\nour study of the stationary current through the SQD, a test measurement\nverifying that the qubit couples to the detector current, already reveals\nvarious significant effects of the isospin torques on the qubit. Our kinetic\nequations provide a starting point for further studies of the time evolution in\ncharge-based qubit readout.

At the same time,\ndistributed routing protocols, most notably OSPF and IS-IS, are still prevalent\nin IP networks, as they provide shortest path routing, fast topological\nconvergence after network failures, and, perhaps most importantly, the\nconfidence based on decades of reliable operation. Therefore, a hybrid SDN/OSPF\noperation remains a desirable proposition. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod of hybrid SDN/OSPF operation. Our method is different from other hybrid\napproaches, as it uses SDN nodes to partition an OSPF domain into sub-domains\nthereby achieving the traffic engineering capabilities comparable to full SDN\noperation. We place SDN-enabled routers as sub-domain border nodes, while the\noperation of the OSPF protocol continues unaffected. In this way, the SDN\ncontroller can tune routing protocol updates for traffic engineering purposes\nbefore they are flooded into sub-domains. While local routing inside\nsub-domains remains stable at all times, inter-sub-domain routes can be\noptimized by determining the routes in each traversed sub-domain. As the\nmajority of traffic in non-trivial topologies has to traverse multiple\nsub-domains, our simulation results confirm that a few SDN nodes allow traffic\nengineering up to a degree that renders full SDN deployment unnecessary.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Our results of\nelectronic band structure predict that puckered SiO and CSe are direct band\nsemiconductors with gaps of 1.449 and 0.905 eV, respectively.

The expected scale of\nthe demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in\nsome cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data\nproduced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities\nand researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new\ntechniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes\nfrom HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and\nanalyze large and complex data volumes.

This paper\nstudies the optimization of dictionaries on image data where the representation\nis enforced to be explicitly sparse with respect to a smooth, normalized\nsparseness measure. This involves the computation of Euclidean projections onto\nlevel sets of the sparseness measure. While previous algorithms for this\noptimization problem had at least quasi-linear time complexity, here the first\nalgorithm with linear time complexity and constant space complexity is\nproposed. The key for this is the mathematically rigorous derivation of a\ncharacterization of the projection's result based on a soft-shrinkage function.\nThis theory is applied in an original algorithm called Easy Dictionary Learning\n(EZDL), which learns dictionaries with a simple and fast-to-compute\nHebbian-like learning rule. The new algorithm is efficient, expressive and\nparticularly simple to implement. It is demonstrated that despite its\nsimplicity, the proposed learning algorithm is able to generate a rich variety\nof dictionaries, in particular a topographic organization of atoms or separable\natoms. Further, the dictionaries are as expressive as those of benchmark\nlearning algorithms in terms of the reproduction quality on entire images, and\nresult in an equivalent denoising performance.

The Sun is an active source of radio emission ranging from long\nduration radio bursts associated with solar flares and coronal mass ejections\nto more complex, short duration radio bursts such as solar S bursts, radio\nspikes and fibre bursts. While plasma emission is thought to be the dominant\nemission mechanism for most radio bursts, the electron-cyclotron maser (ECM)\nmechanism may be responsible for more complex, short-duration bursts as well as\nfine structures associated with long-duration bursts. Aims. We investigate the\nconditions for ECM in the solar corona by considering the ratio of the electron\nplasma frequency {\\omega}p to the electron-cyclotron frequency {\\Omega}e. The\nECM is theoretically possible when {\\omega}p/{\\Omega}e < 1.

All models to date,\nrelating the winds to the gravity field, have been in the forward direction,\nthus allowing only calculation of the gravity field from given wind models.\nHowever, there is a need to do the inverse problem since the new observations\nwill be of the gravity field.

For\nanonymous networks, the task of leader election is formulated as follows: every\nnode v of the network must output a simple path, which is coded as a sequence\nof port numbers, such that all these paths end at a common node, the leader. In\nthis paper, we study deterministic leader election in arbitrary anonymous\nnetworks. It is well known that leader election is impossible in some networks,\nregardless of the allocated amount of time, even if nodes know the map of the\nnetwork. However, even in networks in which it is possible to elect a leader\nknowing the map, the task may be still impossible without any knowledge,\nregardless of the allocated time. On the other hand, for any network in which\nleader election is possible knowing the map, there is a minimum time, called\nthe election index, in which this can be done. Informally, the election index\nof a network is the minimum depth at which views of all nodes are distinct. Our\naim is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\\tau$ and the amount\nof information that has to be given a priori to the nodes to enable leader\nelection in time $\\tau$ in all networks for which leader election in this time\nis at all possible. Following the framework of algorithms with advice, this\ninformation is provided to all nodes at the start by an oracle knowing the\nentire network. The length of this string (its number of bits) is called the\nsize of advice. For a given time $\\tau$ allocated to leader election, we give\nupper and lower bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform\nleader election in time $\\tau$. We focus on the two sides of the time spectrum\nand give tight (or almost tight) bounds on the minimum size of advice for these\nextremes.

Although both strategies have shown therapeutic\npotential, it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion\ninto the surrounding healthy brain tissue. To shed light on this issue, we\npropose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay\nbetween the mi- gration/proliferation dichotomy (Go-or-Grow) of glioma cells\nand modulations of the functional tumour vasculature. Vaso-modulatory\ninterventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso-occlusion.

The interpretation violates the Lorentz symmetry. We give an\nalternative intuitive description of the meaning of this effect, which respects\nthe symmetry and is exact. It can be summarized by stating that a magnetic\nfield makes any charged particle spin. We show also that the traditional\ndiscussion about magnetic monopoles confuses two issues, viz. the symmetry of\nthe Maxwell equations and the quantization of charge. These two issues define\neach a different concept of magnetic monopole. They cannot be merged together\ninto a unique all-encompassing issue.

An\nerror-free application of the Dirac theory cannot account for the Thomas\nprecession, because it only accounts for the instantaneous local boosts, not\nfor the rotational component of the Lorentz transformation.

The approach is based on converting some selected check nodes\ninvolving a trapping set into super checks corresponding to a 2-error\ncorrecting component code. Specifically, we follow two main purposes to\nconstruct the check-hybrid codes; first, based on the knowledge of the trapping\nsets of the global LDPC code, single parity checks are replaced by super checks\nto disable the trapping sets. We show that by converting specified single check\nnodes, denoted as critical checks, to super checks in a trapping set, the\nparallel bit flipping (PBF) decoder corrects the errors on a trapping set and\nhence eliminates the trapping set. The second purpose is to minimize the rate\nloss caused by replacing the super checks through finding the minimum number of\nsuch critical checks. We also present an algorithm to find critical checks in a\ntrapping set of column-weight 3 LDPC code and then provide upper bounds on the\nminimum number of such critical checks such that the decoder corrects all error\npatterns on elementary trapping sets. Moreover, we provide a fixed set for a\nclass of constructed check-hybrid codes. The guaranteed error correction\ncapability of the CH-GLDPC codes is also studied. We show that a CH-GLDPC code\nin which each variable node is connected to 2 super checks corresponding to a\n2-error correcting component code corrects up to 5 errors. The results are also\nextended to column-weight 4 LDPC codes.

It is also found that assumptions\nfor a preordering relation involve an adjoint situation.\n","Comment: 19 pages, correction made at the end of Section 7"]}]

The algebras A and B are called TRO equivalent\nif there exists a ternary ring of operators M (i.e. MM*M\\subset M) such that A\nis the w*-closed span of M*BM and B is the w*-closed span of MAM*. We prove\nthat two reflexive algebras are TRO equivalent if and only if there exists a *\nisomorphism between the commutants of their diagonals mapping the invariant\nprojection lattice of the first algebra onto the lattice of the second one. We\nexplore some consequences of TRO equivalence for CSL algebras. We also prove\nthat TRO equivalence is stronger than \"spatial Morita equivalence\". Two CSL\nalgebras are \"spatially Morita equivalent\" if and only if their lattices are\nisomorphic. In this case if one of them is synthetic then so is the other.\n"]}]
