While many statistical tools have been developed for\nfunctional data analysis, the issue of smoothing all functional observations\nsimultaneously is less studied. Existing methods often focus on smoothing each\nindividual function separately, at the risk of removing important systematic\npatterns common across functions. We propose a nonparametric Bayesian approach\nto smooth all functional observations simultaneously and nonparametrically. In\nthe proposed approach, we assume that the functional observations are\nindependent Gaussian processes subject to a common level of measurement errors,\nenabling the borrowing of strength across all observations. Unlike most\nGaussian process regression models that rely on pre-specified structures for\nthe covariance kernel, we adopt a hierarchical framework by assuming a Gaussian\nprocess prior for the mean function and an Inverse-Wishart process prior for\nthe covariance function. These prior assumptions induce an automatic\nmean-covariance estimation in the posterior inference in addition to the\nsimultaneous smoothing of all observations. Such a hierarchical framework is\nflexible enough to incorporate functional data with different characteristics,\nincluding data measured on either common or uncommon grids, and data with\neither stationary or nonstationary covariance structures. Simulations and real\ndata analysis demonstrate that, in comparison with alternative methods, the\nproposed Bayesian approach achieves better smoothing accuracy and comparable\nmean-covariance estimation results. Furthermore, it can successfully retain the\nsystematic patterns in the functional observations that are usually neglected\nby the existing functional data analyses based on individual-curve smoothing.\n","Comment: Submitted to Bayesian Analysis"]}]

Raw depth data is fused with an\nintermediate representation in the form of a segmentation of the hand into\nparts. This intermediate representation contains important topological\ninformation and provides useful cues for reasoning about joint locations. The\nmapping from raw depth to segmentation maps is learned in a\nsemi/weakly-supervised way from two different datasets: (i) a synthetic dataset\ncreated through a rendering pipeline including densely labeled ground truth\n(pixelwise segmentations); and (ii) a dataset with real images for which ground\ntruth joint positions are available, but not dense segmentations. Loss for\ntraining on real images is generated from a patch-wise restoration process,\nwhich aligns tentative segmentation maps with a large dictionary of synthetic\nposes. The underlying premise is that the domain shift between synthetic and\nreal data is smaller in the intermediate representation, where labels carry\ngeometric and topological meaning, than in the raw input domain. Experiments on\nthe NYU dataset show that the proposed training method decreases error on\njoints over direct regression of joints from depth data by 15.7%.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables"]}]

Based on the Seiberg-Witten map we obtain the gauge invariant and\nLorentz covariant Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in general case on noncommutative\nspace. We find there are two kinds of contribution: momentum-dependent and\nmomentum-independent corrections. For the momentum-dependent correction, there\nis a cancellation between the magnetic and electric phase shifts, just like the\ncase on the commutative space. However, there is a non-trivial contribution in\nthe momentum-independent correction. This is true for both the time-independent\nand time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effects on the noncommutative space. However,\nfor the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, there is no overwhelming\nbackground which exists in the time-independent Aharonov-Bohm effect on both\ncommutative and noncommutative space. Therefore, the time-dependent\nAharonov-Bohm can be sensitive to the spatial noncommutativity. \\draftnote{The\nnet correction is proportional to the product of the magnetic fluxes through\nthe fundamental area represented by the noncommutative parameter $\\theta$, and\nthrough the surface enclosed by the trajectory of charged particle.} More\ninterestingly, there is an anti-collinear relation between the logarithms of\nthe magnetic field $B$ and the averaged flux $\\Phi/N$ (N is the number of\nfringes shifted). This nontrivial relation can also provide a way to test the\nspatial noncommutativity. For $B\\Phi/N\\sim 1$, our estimation on the\nexperimental sensitivity shows that it can reach the $\\rm 10GeV$ scale. This\nsensitivity can be enhanced by using stronger magnetic field strength, larger\nmagnetic flux, as well as higher experimental precision on the phase shift.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 1 figure; v2, accepted version by PLB"]}]

It is important for the theories of black hole accretion\ndisks and their applications to astrophysical black hole systems.\nTraditionally, the marginally stable circular orbit is obtained by considering\nthe equatorial motion of a test particle around a black hole. However, in\nreality the accretion flow around black holes consists of fluid, in which the\npressure often plays an important role. Here we consider the influence of fluid\npressure on the location of marginally stable circular orbit around black\nholes. It is found that when the temperature of the fluid is so low that the\nthermal energy of a particle is much smaller than its rest energy, the location\nof marginally stable circular orbit is almost the same as that in the test\nparticle case.

Because the ETEL\nfunction has a well defined probabilistic interpretation and plays the role of\na likelihood, a fully Bayesian framework can be developed. We establish a\nnumber of powerful results surrounding the Bayesian ETEL framework in such\nmodels. One major concern driving our work is the possibility of\nmisspecification. To accommodate this possibility, we show how the moment\nconditions can be reexpressed in terms of additional nuisance parameters and\nthat, even under misspecification, the Bayesian ETEL posterior distribution\nsatisfies a Bernstein-von Mises result. A second key contribution of the paper\nis the development of a framework based on marginal likelihoods (MLs) and Bayes\nfactors to compare models defined by different moment conditions. Computation\nof the MLs is by Chib (1995)'s method. We establish the consistency of the\nBayes factors and show that the ML favors the model with the minimum number of\nparameters and the maximum number of valid moment restrictions. When the models\nare misspecified, the ML model selection procedure selects the model that is\ncloser to the (unknown) true data generating process in terms of the\nKullback-Leibler divergence. The ideas and results in this paper provide a\nfurther broadening of the theoretical underpinning and value of the Bayesian\nETEL framework with likely far-reaching practical consequences.

Then, using only partial information to\nannotate these documents is promising but remains a very ambitious issue.\nMethodsWe propose two classification methods: a k-nearest neighbours\n(kNN)-based approach and an explicit semantic analysis (ESA)-based approach.\nAlthough the kNN-based approach is widely used in text classification, it needs\nto be improved to perform well in this specific classification problem which\ndeals with partial information.

These measurements both considerably exceed at\nboth low and high energies the ratio predicted using a simple Leaky Box Model\nfor propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy.

Recent studies using simulation and empirical data\nsuggest that a likelihood penalty quantifying concordance with a species tree\ncan significantly improve the accuracy of gene tree reconstruction compared to\nusing sequence data alone. However, the consistency of such an approach has not\nyet been established, nor have convergence rates been bounded.
