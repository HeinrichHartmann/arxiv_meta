Of particular significance are: a) the\ncored dark matter profile of disk galaxies, b) correlations of the shape of\nrotation curves with baryonic properties, and c) Tully-Fisher relations. Dark\nmatter halos around disk galaxies may have nontrivial dynamics if dark matter\nis strongly self interacting and dissipative. Multicomponent hidden sector dark\nmatter featuring a massless `dark photon' (from an unbroken dark $U(1)$ gauge\ninteraction) which kinetically mixes with the ordinary photon provides a\nconcrete example of such dark matter. The kinetic mixing interaction\nfacilitates halo heating by enabling ordinary supernovae to be a source of\nthese `dark photons'. Dark matter halos can expand and contract in response to\nthe heating and cooling processes, but for a sufficiently isolated halo could\nhave evolved to a steady state or `equilibrium' configuration where heating and\ncooling rates locally balance. This dynamics allows the dark matter density\nprofile to be related to the distribution of ordinary supernovae in the disk of\na given galaxy. In a previous paper a simple and predictive formula was derived\nencoding this relation. Here we improve on previous work by modelling the\nsupernovae distribution via the measured UV and $H\\alpha$ fluxes, and compare\nthe resulting dark matter halo profiles with the rotation curve data for each\ndwarf galaxy in the LITTLE THINGS sample.

For all the disk-to-black hole mass ratios\nconsidered (0.044-0.16) we observe significant black hole precession and\nnutation during the evolution. This indicates that for such mass ratios,\nneglecting the self-gravity of the disks by evolving them in a fixed background\nblack hole spacetime is not justified.

Our lightest model, which is the most\nastrophysically favorable outcome of mergers of binary compact objects, is\nstable. The tilt between the black hole spin and the disk is strongly modulated\nduring the growth of the PP instability, causing a partial global realignment\nof black hole spin and disk angular momentum in the most massive model with\nconstant specific angular momentum l. For the model with non-constant l-profile\nwe observe a long-lived m=1 non-axisymmetric structure which shows strong\noscillations of the tilt angle in the inner regions of the disk.

RSF use the log-rank split\ncriterion to form an ensemble of survival trees. The most common approach to\nevaluate the prediction accuracy of a RSF model is Harrell's concordance index\nfor survival data ('C index'). Conceptually, this strategy implies that the\nsplit criterion in RSF is different from the evaluation criterion of interest.\nThis discrepancy can be overcome by using Harrell's C for both node splitting\nand evaluation. We compare the difference between the two split criteria\nanalytically and in simulation studies with respect to the preference of more\nunbalanced splits, termed end-cut preference (ECP). Specifically, we show that\nthe log-rank statistic has a stronger ECP compared to the C index. In\nsimulation studies and with the help of two medical data sets we demonstrate\nthat the accuracy of RSF predictions, as measured by Harrell's C, can be\nimproved if the log-rank statistic is replaced by the C index for node\nsplitting. This is especially true in situations where the censoring rate or\nthe fraction of informative continuous predictor variables is high. Conversely,\nlog-rank splitting is preferable in noisy scenarios. Both C-based and log-rank\nsplitting are implemented in the R~package ranger. We recommend Harrell's C as\nsplit criterion for use in smaller scale clinical studies and the log-rank\nsplit criterion for use in large-scale 'omics' studies.\n"]}]

Contrary to polarization, intensity\ndistortions are affected by all the CMB multipoles, so they cannot be readily\nused to probe the low multipoles at higher redshifts.

Our boundary conditions\nthen provide a gravitational dual of two noninteracting left and right KdV\nmovers, and hence, boundary gravitons possess anisotropic Lifshitz scaling with\ndynamical exponent $z=2k+1$. Remarkably, despite spacetimes solving the field\nequations are locally AdS, they possess anisotropic scaling being induced by\nthe choice of boundary conditions. As an application, the entropy of a rotating\nBTZ black hole is precisely recovered from a suitable generalization of the\nCardy formula that is compatible with the anisotropic scaling of the chiral KdV\nmovers at the boundary, in which the energy of AdS spacetime with our boundary\nconditions depends on $z$ and plays the role of the central charge. The\nextension of our boundary conditions to the case of higher spin gravity and its\nlink with different classes of integrable systems is also briefly addressed.\n","Comment: 18 pages, no figures, Final version for JHEP"]}]

The change\nof relative intensity between the leading and trailing components is the\npredominant feature of mode switching. The intensity ratio between the leading\nand trailing components are measured for the individual profiles averaged over\n30 seconds. It is found that there is an excess of high ratios over the normal\ndistribution, which indicates that two modes exist in the pulsar. The\ndistribution of abnormal mode has a narrower width indicating that the abnormal\nmode is more stable than the normal mode. A total of 76 mode switching events\nare detected in our data. It spends 89\\% in the normal mode and 11\\% in the\nabnormal mode. The intrinsic distributions of mode timescales are constrained\nwith power-law distributions. The significant difference in the index of the\nduration distribution between normal and abnormal modes possibly indicates that\nthe timescale for the abnormal mode to get stable is shorter than that for the\nnormal mode. The frequent switching between both modes may indicate that the\noscillations between different magnetospheric states are rapid.\n"]}]

Most hot stars rapidly rotate\naround their stellar axes. The stellar rotation makes ellipticity and\ngravity-darkening effects which break the spherical symmetry of the source\nshape and the circular symmetry of the source surface brightness respectively.\nHence, it causes a net polarization signal for the source star. This\npolarization signal should be considered in polarimetry microlensing of fast\nrotating stars. For moderate rotating stars, lensing can magnify or even\ncharacterize small polarization signals due to the stellar rotation through\npolarimetry observations. The gravity-darkening effect due to a rotating source\nstar makes asymmetric perturbations in polarimetry and photometry microlensing\ncurves whose maximum happens when the lens trajectory crosses the projected\nposition of the rotation pole on the sky plane. The stellar ellipticity makes a\ntime shift (i) in the position of the second peak of the polarimetry curves in\ntransit microlensing events and (ii) in the peak position of the polarimetry\ncurves with respect to the photometry peak position in bypass microlensing\nevents.

We study the equilibria of the induced distribution-committing\ngames in several well-known mechanisms.

The FM1 and FM2 ferromagnetic\nphases, above and below the magnetostructural transition (TS1=120 K) have been\ninvestigated. The FM2 phase of PSCO is composed of [100] FM domains, with\nmagnetic symmetry Im'm'a (mz=0). The magnetic space group of the FM1 phase is\nFm'm'm (with mx=my). Neutron data analyses in combination with magnetometry and\nearlier reports results agrees with a reorientation of the magnetization axis\nby 45 deg within the a-b plane across the transition, in which the system\nretains its metallic character. The presence below TS1 of conjugated magnetic\ndomains, both of Fm'm'm symmetry but having perpendicular spin orientations\nalong the diagonals in the xy-plane of the tetragonal unit cell, is at the\norigin of the anomalies observed in the macroscopic magnetization. A relatively\nsmall field m0H > 30 mT is able to reorient the magnetization within the a-b\nplane, whereas a higher field (m0H,[H//z] >1.2 T at 2K) is necessary to align\nthe Co moments perpendicular to a-b plane. Such a spin reorientation, in which\nthe orbital and spin components of the Co moment rotate joined by 45deg, was\nnot observed with other lanthanides different to praseodymium.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

Our\nmethod exploits the limitations of human visual perception in order to\nunobtrusively leak data through a standard computer LCD display. Our\nexperiments show that very low contrast or fast flickering images which are\ninvisible to human subjects, can be recovered from photos taken by a camera.\nConsequentially, we show that malicious code on a compromised computer can\nobtain sensitive data (e.g., images, encryption keys, passwords), and project\nit onto a computer LCD screen, invisible and unbeknownst to users, allowing an\nattacker to reconstruct the data using a photo taken by a nearby (possibly\nhidden) camera. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of this type of attack\nand evaluate the channel's stealth, we conducted a battery of tests with 40\nhuman subjects. We also examined the channel's boundaries under various\nparameters, with different types of encoded objects, at several distances, and\nusing several kinds of cameras.

Among our results are the following:\n(i) If $G$ is of odd order and $(n-1)/2 \\leq h \\leq n-2$, then\n$C_h(G)=Z_h(G)=h+1$, unless $G$ is an elementary abelian 3-group and $h=n-3$;\n(ii) If $G$ is an elementary abelian 2-group and $n/2 \\leq h \\leq n-2$, then\n$C_h(G)=Z_h(G)=h+2$, unless $h=n-4$.\n","Comment: 15 pages"]}]

Distinguishable particles typically cannot interfere\nwith each other, but we overcome that obstacle by processing the particles so\nthat they lead to the same final state at the detection apparatus.\nSpecifically, we discuss how quasi-phase-matched nonlinear crystals can be used\nto convert a quantum superposition of light of different wavelengths onto a\ncommon wavelength, while preserving the phase information essential for their\nmeaningful interference. We generalize the van Cittert-Zernike formula for the\nintensity interferometry of extended sources, demonstrate how our proposal\nsupports enhanced resolution of sources with different spectral character, and\nsuggest potential applications.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 8 figures"]}]
