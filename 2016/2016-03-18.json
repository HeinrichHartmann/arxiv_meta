Prominent among the problems of\nquantum gravity are those of unitarity and observables. In a unitary theory\nwith solutions approximating Minkowski space, the S-matrix (or, in four\ndimensions, related inclusive probabilities) should be sharply formulated and\nphysical. Features of its perturbative description are reviewed. A successful\nquantum gravity theory should in particular address the questions posed by the\nultrahigh-energy regime. Some control can be gained in this regime by varying\nthe impact parameter as well as the collision energy. However, with decreasing\nimpact parameter gravity becomes strong, first eikonalizing, and then entering\nthe regime where in the classical approximation black holes form.

A graph is called {\\it total rainbow connected} if any two vertices of\nthe graph are connected by a total rainbow path. In this paper we introduce the\nconcept of strong total rainbow connection of graphs. A graph is called {\\it\nstrongly total rainbow connected} if any two vertices of the graph are\nconnected by a total rainbow geodesic, i.e., a path of length equal to the\ndistance between the two vertices. For a connected graph $G$, the {\\it strong\ntotal rainbow connection number}, denoted by $strc(G)$, is the minimum number\nof colors that are needed to make $G$ strongly total rainbow connected. Among\nour results we state some simple observations about $strc(G)$ for a connected\ngraph $G$. We also investigate the strong total rainbow connection numbers of\nsome special graphs. Finally, for any pair of positive integers $a$ and $b$\nwith $b\\geq a$, except for four cases, we can construct a connected graph $G$\nsuch that $trc(G)=a$ meanwhile $strc(G)=b$.}\n","Comment: 17 pages"]}]

Thanks to\nthe wide spread use of GPS-enabled devices, many applications assign a spatial\nattribute to graph vertices (e.g., geo-tagged social media). Users may issue a\nReachability Query with Spatial Range Predicate (abbr. RangeReach). RangeReach\nfinds whether an input vertex can reach any spatial vertex that lies within an\ninput spatial range. An example of a RangeReach query is: Given a social graph,\nfind whether Alice can reach any of the venues located within the geographical\narea of Arizona State University. The paper proposes GeoReach an approach that\nadds spatial data awareness to a graph database management system (GDBMS).\nGeoReach allows efficient execution of RangeReach queries, yet without\ncompromising a lot on the overall system scalability (measured in terms of\nstorage size and initialization/maintenance time).

Several countermeasures have been proposed\nin the past to detect GPS spoofing attacks. These countermeasures offer\nprotection only against naive attackers.
