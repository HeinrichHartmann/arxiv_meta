We consider such a\ndiscretization for the Stokes part with two important features:\nH(div)-conforming finite elements to garantuee exactly divergence-free velocity\nsolutions and a projection operator which reduces the number of globally\ncoupled unknowns. We present the method, discuss implementational aspects and\ndemonstrate the performance on two and three dimensional benchmark problems.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 3 figures, 4 table"]}]

In order to reduce the\noverall transmission rate, these approaches provide a \"merge\" mechanism, where\ninformation is sent to the decoder such that the exact same frame can be\nreconstructed given that any one of a known set of side information (SI) frames\nis available at the decoder (e.g., each SI frame may correspond to a different\nstream from which we are switching).

In\nthis paper, we propose an alternative approach for merging multiple SI frames,\nusing a piecewise constant (PWC) function as the merge operator. In our\napproach, for each block to be reconstructed, a series of parameters of these\nPWC merge functions are transmitted in order to guarantee identical\nreconstruction given the known side information blocks. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios. In the first case, a target frame is first given, and then\nmerge parameters are chosen so that this frame can be reconstructed exactly at\nthe decoder.

If the delay time between successive\naccretion bursts is sufficiently short, the protostar remains bloated for\nextended periods, initiating at most only short periods of UV feedback.

Luminosities L_FIR ~ 10^11 L_Sun can be\nreached with a variety of structures spanning 2 dex in size. Ultraluminous\nL_FIR >~ 10^12 L_Sun galaxies far above the main-sequence inevitably have small\nRe_70um ~ 0.5 kpc FIR emitting regions with large surface brightness, and can\nbe close to optically thick in the FIR on average over these regions. Compared\nto these local relations, first ALMA sizes for the dust emission regions in\nhigh redshift galaxies, measured at somewhat longer rest wavelengths, suggest\nlarger sizes at the same IR luminosity. We report a remarkably tight relation\nwith 0.15 dex scatter between FIR surface brightness and the ratio of [CII]\n158um emission and FIR emission -- the so-called [CII]-deficit is more tightly\nlinked to surface brightness than to FIR luminosity or FIR color. Among 33 z <~\n0.1 PG QSOs with typical L_FIR/L_Bol,AGN ~ 0.1, 19 have a measured 70um half\nlight radius, with median Re_70um = 1.1kpc. This is consistent with the FIR\nsize for galaxies with similar L_FIR but lacking a QSO, in accordance with a\nscenario where the rest FIR emission of these types of QSOs is, in most cases,\ndue to host star formation.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

A possible UV-completion that has been\nwidely considered in literature is based on the existence of new vector-like\nfermions whose loop contributions---Yukawa-coupled to the new\nresonance---explain the observed signal rate. The large total width\npreliminarily suggested by data seems to favor a large Yukawa coupling, at the\nborder of a healthy perturbative definition. This potential problem can be\nfixed by introducing multiple vector-like fermions or large electric charges,\nbringing back the theory to a weakly coupled regime. However, this solution\nrisks to be only a low-energy mirage: Large multiplicity or electric charge can\ndangerously reintroduce the strong regime by modifying the renormalization\ngroup running of the dimensionless couplings. This issue is also tightly\nrelated to the (in)stability of the scalar potential. First, we study---in the\ntheoretical setup described above---the parametric behavior of the diphoton\nsignal rate, total width, and one-loop $\\beta$ functions. Then, we numerically\nsolve the renormalization group equations, taking into account the observed\ndiphoton signal rate and total width, to investigate the fate of the weakly\ncoupled theory. We find that---with the only exception of few fine-tuned\ndirections---weakly coupled interpretations of the excess are brought back to a\nstrongly coupled regime if the running is taken into account.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 38 figures, version appeared in JHEP, Fig.1 and 4 revised,\n  references added, new section V.C added"]}]

For comparison, we also varied the gas giant's orbital and physical\nparameters. Our simulations highlight that a disk of planetesimals will suffer\nfrom perturbations owing to a perturbed gas giant, mean motion, and secular\nresonances. We show that a secular resonance -- with location and width varying\naccording to the secondary star's characteristics -- can exist in the icy\nasteroid belt region and overlap with MMRs which have an impact on the\ndynamical lifetime of the disk.

This is accounted for by the diminishing impact of the\nviscous stresses exerted within Ekman boundary layers and the associated\nvertical momentum transport by Ekman pumping. By contrast, in the nonlinear\nregime recent experiments and supporting simulations are now providing evidence\nthat the efficiency of heat transport remains strongly influenced by Ekman\npumping in the rapidly rotating limit. In this paper, a reduced model is\ndeveloped for the case of low Rossby number convection in a plane layer\ngeometry with no-slip upper and lower boundaries held at fixed temperatures. A\ncomplete description of the dynamics requires the existence of three distinct\nregions within the fluid layer: a geostrophically balanced interior where fluid\nmotions are predominately aligned with the axis of rotation, Ekman boundary\nlayers immediately adjacent to the bounding plates, and thermal wind layers\ndriven by Ekman pumping in between. The reduced model uses a classical Ekman\npumping parameterization to alleviate the need for spatially resolving the\nEkman boundary layers. Results are presented for both linear stability theory\nand a special class of nonlinear solutions described by a single horizontal\nspatial wavenumber. It is shown that Ekman pumping allows for significant\nenhancement in the heat transport relative to that observed in simulations with\nstress-free boundaries. Without the intermediate thermal wind layer the\nnonlinear feedback from Ekman pumping would be able to generate a heat\ntransport that diverges to infinity. This layer arrests this blowup resulting\nin finite heat transport at a significantly enhanced value.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 14 figures"]}]

We systematically compare\nconstraints derived from the mass mechanism to those derived from the\nlong-range double beta decay amplitude and classify our list of models\naccordingly.

These observations imply\nthat the passage of the radio jet in the interstellar and inter-cluster medium\nnot only heats gas to high temperatures as is commonly assumed or found in\nsimulations, but also induces cooling and dissipation which can lead to\nsubstantial amounts of cold dense molecular gas. The formation of molecules and\nstrong dissipation in the halo gas of MRC1138-262 may explain both the extended\ndiffuse molecular gas and young stars observed around MRC1138-262.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

The solution of this problem\ndemands accounting for the source of the field. Hence we focus on the work done\nby a heavy body (source) on a lighter particle when the interaction between\nthem is electromagnetic and relativistic. The work can be defined via the\ngauge-invariant kinetic energy of the source. We uncover a formulation of the\nfirst law (or the generalized work-energy theorem) which is derived from\nrelativistic dynamics, has definite validity conditions, and relates the work\nto the particle's Hamiltonian in the Lorenz gauge. Thereby the thermodynamic\nwork also relates to the mechanic work done by the Lorentz force acting on the\nsource. The formulation of the first law is based on a specific separation of\nthe overall energy into those of the source, particle and electromagnetic\nfield. This separation is deduced from a consistent energy-momentum tensor.\nHence it holds relativistic covariance and causality.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures; published version"]}]

We have previously\ndiscovered linear polarization signatures associated with individual lines in\nthe spectra of cool and evolved stars.

We used the\nspectropolarimeter Narval, combining multiple polarimetric sequences to obtain\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio spectra of individual lines, as well as the\nleast-squares deconvolution (LSD) approach.

Studying its properties and the signal observed\nfor the resonant \\ion{Na}{i}\\,D lines, we conclude that we are mainly observing\ndepolarization of the continuum by the absorption lines. The linear\npolarization of the Betelgeuse continuum is due to the anisotropy of the\nradiation field induced by brightness spots at the surface and Rayleigh\nscattering in the atmosphere. We have developed a geometrical model to\ninterpret the observed polarization, from which we infer the presence of two\nbrightness spots and their positions on the surface of Betelgeuse.

These null points and their associated\nseparatrix and spine field lines represent discontinuities of the field line\nmapping, making them preferential locations for reconnection. This field line\nmapping also exhibits strong gradients adjacent to the separatrix (fan) and\nspine field lines, that can be analysed using the `squashing factor', $Q$. In\nthis paper we make a detailed analysis of the distribution of $Q$ in the\npresence of magnetic nulls. While $Q$ is formally infinite on both the spine\nand fan of the null, the decay of $Q$ away from these structures is shown in\ngeneral to depend strongly on the null-point structure. For the generic case of\na non-radially-symmetric null, $Q$ decays most slowly away from the spine/fan\nin the direction in which $|{\\bf B}|$ increases most slowly. In particular,\nthis demonstrates that the extended, elliptical high-$Q$ halo around the spine\nfootpoints observed by Masson et al. (Astrophys. J., 700, 559, 2009) is a\ngeneric feature. This extension of the $Q$ halos around the spine/fan\nfootpoints is important for diagnosing the regions of the photosphere that are\nmagnetically connected to any current layer that forms at the null. In light of\nthis, we discuss how our results can be used to interpret the geometry of\nobserved flare ribbons in `circular ribbon flares', in which typically a\ncoronal null is implicated.

A plausible\nexplanation is that methane could have been produced either by hydrothermal\nalteration of basaltic crust or by serpentinization of ultramafic rocks\nproducing hydrogen and reducing crustal carbon into methane. Once formed,\nmethane storage on Mars is commonly associated with the presence of hidden\nclathrate reservoirs. Here, we alternatively suggest that chabazite and\nclinoptilolite, which belong to the family of zeolites, may form a plausible\nstorage reservoir of methane in the martian subsurface.

The sporadic\nrelease of methane from these zeolites requires that they also remained\nisolated from the atmosphere during its evolution. The methane release over the\nages could be due to several mechanisms such as impacts, seismic activity or\nerosion.

They are affected by the temperature fluctuation in air,\nobstruction due to the solid objects, even the humidity difference in the\nenvironment, etc. How the varying range of transmission of the individual\nactive elements affects the global connectivity in the network may be an\nimportant practical question to ask. Here a new model of percolation phenomena,\nwith an additional source of disorder, has been introduced for a theoretical\nunderstanding of this problem. As in ordinary percolation, sites of a square\nlattice are occupied randomly with the probability $p$. Each occupied site is\nthen assigned a circular disc of random value $R$ for its radius. A bond is\ndefined to be occupied if and only if the radii $R_1$ and $R_2$ of the discs\ncentered at the ends satisfy certain pre-defined condition. In a very general\nformulation, one divides the $R_1 - R_2$ plane into two regions by an arbitrary\nclosed curve. One defines that a point within one region represents an occupied\nbond, otherwise it is a vacant bond. Study of three different rules under this\ngeneral formulation, indicates that the percolation threshold is always larger\nand varies continuously. This threshold has two limiting values, one is\n$p_c$(sq), the percolation threshold for the ordinary site percolation on the\nsquare lattice and the other being unity. The variation of the thresholds are\ncharacterized by exponents, which are not known in the literature.

However, without consideration of the diversity in\nattention process, most of existing attention models perform poorly in\nclassifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we propose a diversified\nvisual attention network (DVAN) to address the problems of fine-grained object\nclassification, which substan- tially relieves the dependency on\nstrongly-supervised information for learning to localize discriminative regions\ncompared with attentionless models.

The proposed\nDVAN has the ability to attend the object from coarse to fine granularity, and\na dynamic internal representation for classification is built up by\nincrementally combining the information from different locations and scales of\nthe image.

To compensate for these nonlinear disturbances, existing\ntechniques compute the pre-inverse of the power amplifier by estimation of a\nnonlinear model.

We again use the idea of sampling offsets from non-uniform\ndistributions to give the first better than 2-approximation for this problem.\nThis improvement also requires use of a configuration LP with variables for\neach job's complete schedules along with more careful analysis. For both\nnon-preemptive and preemptive versions, we break the approximation barrier of 2\nfor the first time.\n","Comment: 24 pages. To apper in FOCS 2016"]}]
