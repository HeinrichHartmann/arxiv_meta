This phenomenon is\ncommonly referred to as the \"coffee-ring\" effect. One paradigm for why this\noccurs is as a consequence of the solutes being transported towards the pinned\ncontact line by the flow inside the drop, which is induced by surface\nevaporation. From this perspective, the role of the liquid-gas interface in\nshaping the deposition pattern is somewhat minimized. Here, we propose an\nalternative mechanism for the coffee-ring deposition. It is based on the bulk\nflow within the drop transporting particles to the interface where they are\ncaptured by the receding free surface and subsequently transported along the\ninterface until they are deposited near the contact line. That the interface\ncaptures the solutes as the evaporation proceeds is supported by a Lagrangian\ntracing of particles advected by the flow field within the droplet. We model\nthe interfacial adsorption and transport of particles as a one-dimensional\nadvection-generation process in toroidal coordinates and show that the theory\nreproduces ring-shaped depositions. Using this model, deposition patterns on\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces are examined in which the evaporation\nis modeled as being either diffusive or uniform over the surface.\n"]}]

In contrast to general multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)\ncellular schemes, multibeam satellite architectures suffer from different\nchallenges. First, satellite communications standards embed more than one user\nin each frame in order to increase the channel coding gain. This leads to the\ndifferent so-called multigroup multicast model, whose optimization requires\ncomputationally complex operations. Second, when the data traffic is generated\nby several Earth stations (gateways), the precoding matrix must be\ndistributively computed and attain additional payload restrictions. Third,\nsince the feedback channel is adverse (large delay and quantization errors),\nthe precoding must be able to deal with such uncertainties. In order to solve\nthe aforementioned problems, we propose a two-stage precoding design in order\nto both limit the multibeam interference and to enhance the intra-beam minimum\nuser signal power (i.e. the one that dictates the rate allocation per beam). A\nrobust version of the proposed precoder based on a first perturbation model is\npresented. This mechanism behaves well when the channel state information is\ncorrupted.

It has been argued that the lesser photon energy of the radiation of\nthe relatively cool RDs would not suffice for Oxygenic Photosynthesis (OP) and\nother related energy expending reactions. Numerous authors suggest that OP on\nRD planets may evolve to utilize photons in the infrared. We however argue, by\nanalogy to the evolution of OP and the environmental physiology and\ndistribution of land-based vegetation on Earth, that the evolutionary pressure\nto utilize infrared radiation would be small. This is because vegetation on RD\nplanets could enjoy continuous illumination of moderate intensity, containing a\nsignificant component of photosynthetic 400-700 nm radiation. We conclude that\nconditions for OP could exist on RD planets and consequently the evolution of\ncomplex life might be possible. Furthermore, the huge number and the long\nlifetime of RDs make it more likely to find planets with photosynthesis and\nlife around RDs than around solar type stars.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication by the International\n  Journal of Astrobiology"]}]

By complementing the IRAS spectral coverage with\nPlanck satellite data from 100 to 857 GHz, we provide new constraints on the IR\nspectrum of thermal dust emission in clusters of galaxies. We achieve this by\nusing a stacking approach for a sample of several hundred objects from the\nPlanck cluster sample; this procedure averages out fluctuations from the IR\nsky, allowing us to reach a significant detection of the faint cluster\ncontribution. We also use the large frequency range probed by Planck, together\nwith component-separation techniques, to remove the contamination from both\ncosmic microwave background anisotropies and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich\neffect (tSZ) signal, which dominate below 353 GHz. By excluding dominant\nspurious signals or systematic effects, averaged detections are reported at\nfrequencies between 353 and 5000 GHz. We confirm the presence of dust in\nclusters of galaxies at low and intermediate redshifts, yielding an SED with a\nshape similar to that of the Milky Way. Planck's beam does not allow us to\ninvestigate the detailed spatial distribution of this emission (e.g., whether\nit comes from intergalactic dust or simply the dust content of the cluster\ngalaxies), but the radial distribution of the emission appears to follow that\nof the stacked SZ signal, and thus the extent of the clusters. The recovered\nSED allows us to constrain the dust mass responsible for the signal, as well as\nits temperature.

Two massive clumps in the periphery of A520, visible in the weak\nlensing mass map and the X-ray image, have apparently been completely stripped\nof gas during the merger, but then re-accreted the surrounding high-entropy gas\nupon exit from the cluster. An X-ray hydrostatic mass estimate for one of the\nclumps (that has simple geometry) agrees with the lensing mass.

By studying\nthe temperature dependence of the $\\kappa$--deformed Hall conductivity, we show\nthat an increase of the temperature causes the smearing of the plateaus and a\ndiminution of the effect of the deformation, whilst an increase in the magnetic\nfield enhances the effect of the deformation.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 7 figures, v3: Title changed, 4 figures added, one table\n  added, discussion on temperature dependence added, matches published version"]}]

These strong\ncorrelations have often been taken to indicate that the internal structure of a\ngalaxy must play a major physical role, directly or indirectly, in the control\nof star-formation. In this paper we show by means of a very simple toy model\nthat these correlations can arise naturally without any such physical role once\nthe observed evolution of the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies is\ntaken into account. In particular, the model reproduces the sharp threshold in\n{\\Sigma} between galaxies that are star-forming and those that are quenched,\nand the evolution of this threshold with redshift.

It does so without any dependence on quenching on size or {\\Sigma},\nand without invoking any differences between centrals and satellites, beyond\nthe different mass-dependences of their quenching laws. The toy-model also\nreproduces several other observations, including the sSFR gradients within\ngalaxies and the appearance of inside-out build-up of passive galaxies.\nFinally, it is shown that curvature in the Main Sequence sSFR-mass relation can\nproduce curvature in the apparent B/T ratios with mass.

The simulations follow three\nexponential disks of different mass but similar circular velocity, radial\nscalelength, and (constant) scale height. The disks develop different\nnon-axisymmetric patterns, ranging from feeble, long-lived multiple arms to\nstrong, rapidly-evolving few-armed spirals. These fluctuations induce radial\nmigration through secular changes in the angular momentum of disk particles,\nmixing the disk radially and blurring pre-existing gradients. Migration affects\nprimarily stars with small vertical excursions, regardless of spiral pattern.\nThis \"provenance bias\" largely determines the vertical structure of migrating\nstars: inward migrators thin down as they move in, whereas outward migrators do\nnot thicken up but rather preserve the disk scale height at destination.\nMigrators of equal birth radius thus develop a strong scale-height gradient,\nnot by flaring out as commonly assumed, but by thinning down as they spread\ninward. Similar gradients have been observed for low-[$\\alpha$/Fe]\nmono-abundance populations (MAPs) in the Galaxy but our results argue against\ninterpreting them as a consequence of radial migration. This is because outward\nmigration does not lead to thickening, implying that the maximum scale height\nof any population should reflect its value at birth. In contrast, Galactic MAPs\nhave scale heights that increase monotonically outwards, reaching values that\ngreatly exceed those at their presumed birth radii. Given the strong vertical\nbias affecting migration, a proper assessment of the importance of radial\nmigration in the Galaxy should take carefully into account the strong radial\ndependence of the scale heights of the various stellar populations.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

Both effects are in perfect agreement with experimental findings.\nWe also compute the resistivity for temperatures above and below critical\ntemperature $T_o$. We explain an upturn of the resistivity at 28K and interpret\nthe suppression of this extra component of resistivity when a magnetic field is\napplied along the conducting axis.

The\ncurrent generation of instruments can exhibit sensitivity variations greater\nthan the astrophysical signals. For the InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) on the\nSpitzer Space Telescope, a popular way to handle this is\nBiLinearly-Interpolated Subpixel Sensitivity (BLISS) mapping. As part of a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), BLISS mapping estimates the sensitivity at\nmany locations (knots) on the pixel, then interpolates to the target star's\ncentroids. We show that such embedded optimization schemes can misfit or bias\nparameters. Thus, we construct a model of $\\textit{Spitzer}$ eclipse light\ncurves to test the accuracy and precision of BLISS mapping. We compare standard\nBLISS mapping to a variant where the knots are fit during the MCMC, as well as\nto a polynomial model. Both types of BLISS mapping give similar eclipse depths,\nand we find that standard knots behave like real parameters. Standard BLISS\nmapping is therefore a reasonable shortcut to fitting for knots in an MCMC.\nBLISS maps become inaccurate when the photon noise is low, but typically\napproximate the real sensitivity well. We also find there is no perfect method\nfor choosing the ideal number of BLISS knots to use on given data. BLISS\nmapping gives fits that are usually more accurate than precise (i.e. they are\noverly conservative), and the routine is more precise than polynomial models\nfor significant eclipses or pixels with more varied sensitivities. BLISS\nmapping has better predictive power for most of these particular synthetic\ndata, depending on how one treats time-correlated residuals.

The sample includes 147 CEMP-$s$ (and CEMP-r/s) stars, 127\nCEMP-no stars, and 31 CEMP stars that are unclassified, based on the currently\nemployed [Ba/Fe] criterion. We confirm previous claims that the distribution of\n$A$(C) for CEMP stars is (at least) bimodal, with newly determined peaks\ncentered on $A$(C)$=7.96$ (the high-C region) and $A$(C)$ =6.28$ (the low-C\nregion). A very high fraction of CEMP-$s$ (and CEMP-r/s) stars belong to the\nhigh-C region, while the great majority of CEMP-no stars reside in the low-C\nregion. However, there exists complexity in the morphology of the $A$(C)-[Fe/H]\nspace for the CEMP-no stars, a first indication that more than one class of\nfirst-generation stellar progenitors may be required to account for their\nobserved abundances. The two groups of CEMP-no stars we identify exhibit\nclearly different locations in the $A$(Na)-$A$(C) and $A$(Mg)-$A$(C) spaces,\nalso suggesting multiple progenitors. The clear distinction in $A$(C) between\nthe CEMP-$s$ (and CEMP-$r/s$) stars and the CEMP-no stars appears to be $as\\\nsuccessful$, and $likely\\ more\\ astrophysically\\ fundamental$, for the\nseparation of these sub-classes as the previously recommended criterion based\non [Ba/Fe] (and [Ba/Eu]) abundance ratios.

These values are calculated from the summed line emission observed in\na blind, deep survey for specrtal line emission from high redshift galaxies\nusing ALMA (the 'ASPECS' survey). In the 99 GHz band, the mean brightness will\nbe dominated by rotational transitions of CO from intermediate and high\nredshift galaxies. In the 242GHz band, the emission could be a combination of\nhigher order CO lines, and possibly [CII] 158$\\mu$m line emission from very\nhigh redshift galaxies ($z \\sim 6$ to 7). The mean line surface brightness is a\nquantity that is relevant to measurements of spectral distortions of the cosmic\nmicrowave background, and as a potential tool for studying large-scale\nstructures in the early Universe using intensity mapping. While the cosmic\nvolume and the number of detections are admittedly small, this pilot survey\nprovides a direct measure of the mean line surface brightness, independent of\nconversion factors, excitation, or other galaxy formation model assumptions.\nThe mean surface brightness in the 99GHZ band is: $T_B = 0.94\\pm 0.09$ $\\mu$K.\nIn the 242GHz band, the mean brightness is: $T_B = 0.55\\pm 0.033$ $\\mu$K. These\nshould be interpreted as lower limits on the average sky signal, since we only\ninclude lines detected individually in the blind survey, while in a low\nresolution intensity mapping experiment, there will also be the summed\ncontribution from lower luminosity galaxies that cannot be detected\nindividually in the current blind survey.\n","Comment: To appear the Astrophysical Journal, incorporating the first and\n  second round of referee comments.

Based on astrometric measurements\nfrom OSSOS and Pan-STARRS1, we find that 2015 RR$_{245}$ is securely trapped on\nten-Myr timescales in the 9:2 mean-motion resonance with Neptune. It is the\nfirst TNO identified in this resonance. On hundred-Myr timescales, particles in\n2015 RR$_{245}$-like orbits depart and sometimes return to the resonance,\nindicating that 2015 RR$_{245}$ likely forms part of the long-lived metastable\npopulation of distant TNOs that drift between resonance sticking and actively\nscattering via gravitational encounters with Neptune. The discovery of a 9:2\nTNO stresses the role of resonances in the long-term evolution of objects in\nthe scattering disk, and reinforces the view that distant resonances are\nheavily populated in the current Solar System. This object further motivates\ndetailed modelling of the transient sticking population.\n","Comment: Accepted to AJ"]}]

We pay particular attention to the Hubble\ninduced mass by the kinetic energy of an oscillating inflaton, which is\ngenerically unsuppressed but often overlooked. In the curvaton scenario, the\nHubble induced mass relaxes the constraint on the property of the inflaton and\nthe curvaton, such as the reheating temperature and the inflation scale. We\ncomment on the implication of our discussion for baryogenesis in the curvaton\nscenario. In the modulated reheating, the predictions of models e.g. the\nnon-gaussianity can be considerably altered.

Our model explains the\nformation of X-ray emitting stationary shocks in a natural way. The magnetic\nfield collimates the plasma at the base of the jet and forms there a magnetic\nnozzle. After an initial transient, the nozzle leads to the formation of a\nshock diamond at its exit which is stationary over the time covered by the\nsimulations (~ 40 - 60 yr; comparable with time scales of the observations).\nThe shock generates a point-like X-ray source located close to the base of the\njet with luminosity comparable with that inferred from X-ray observations of\nprotostellar jets.

IRIS is composed of a\ncombination of near-infrared (0.84--2.4 $\\mu$m) diffraction limited imager and\nintegral field spectrograph. To achieve near-diffraction limited resolutions in\nthe near-infrared wavelength region, IRIS uses the advanced adaptive optics\nsystem NFIRAOS (Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System) and integrated\non-instrument wavefront sensors (OIWFS). However, IRIS itself has challenging\nspecifications. First, the overall system wavefront error should be less than\n40 nm in Y, z, J, and H-band and 42 nm in K-band over a 34.0 $\\times$ 34.0\narcsecond field of view. Second, the throughput of the imager components should\nbe more than 42 percent. To achieve the extremely low wavefront error and high\nthroughput, all reflective design has been newly proposed. We have adopted a\nnew design policy called \"Co-Axis double-TMA\", which cancels the asymmetric\naberrations generated by \"collimator/TMA\" and \"camera/TMA\" efficiently. The\nlatest imager design meets all specifications, and, in particular, the\nwavefront error is less than 17.3 nm and throughput is more than 50.8 percent.\nHowever, to meet the specification of wavefront error and throughput as built\nperformance, the IRIS imager requires both mirrors with low surface\nirregularity after high-reflection coating in cryogenic and high-level Assembly\nIntegration and Verification (AIV). To deal with these technical challenges, we\nhave done the tolerance analysis and found that total pass rate is almost 99\npercent in the case of gauss distribution and more than 90 percent in the case\nof parabolic distribution using four compensators.

We show that the shock-compressed diffuse interstellar medium of\ndensity n~1 cm^-3 evolves into HI clouds with typical density n~50 cm^-3 via\nthermal instability driven by cooling, which is consistent with previous\nstudies. We apply a machine vision transformation developed by Clark et\nal.(2014) to the resulting column density structures obtained by the\nsimulations in order to measure angle correlation between filamentary\nstructures of HI clouds and magnetic field. We find that the orientation of HI\nfilaments depends on the environmental turbulent velocity field, particularly\non the strength of shear strain in the direction of the magnetic field, which\nis controlled by the angle between the shock propagation direction and upstream\nmagnetic field. When the strain along the magnetic field is weak, filamentary\ncomponents of HI clouds basically lie perpendicular to the magnetic field.\nHowever, the filaments have come to align with the magnetic field, if we\nenhance the turbulent strain along the magnetic field or if we set turbulence\nin the preshock medium.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal"]}]

We argue that the\nstrain-induced crystal-field splitting generally favors the Mott-insulating\nstate, whereas the strain-induced changes in the hopping parameters favor the\nmetallic state under compressive strain and the insulating state under tensile\nstrain. Thus, the two effects can effectively cancel each other under\ncompressive strain, while they usually cooperate under tensile strain, in this\ncase favoring the insulating state.

Here we use the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly to analyse a\nflare and erupting flux rope on 2014-April-18, while observations from the\nNancay Radio Astronomy Facility allows us to diagnose the sites of electron\nacceleration during the eruption. Our analysis shows evidence for a pre-formed\nflux rope which slowly rises and becomes destabilised at the time of a C-class\nflare, plasma jet and the escape of >75 keV electrons from rope center into the\ncorona. As the eruption proceeds, continued acceleration of electrons with\nenergies of ~5 keV occurs above the flux rope for a period over 5 minutes. At\nflare peak, one site of electron acceleration is located close to the flare\nsite while another is driven by the erupting flux rope into the corona at\nspeeds of up to 400 km/s. Energetic electrons then fill the erupting volume,\neventually allowing the flux rope legs to be clearly imaged from radio sources\nat 150-445MHz. Following the analysis of Joshi et al.

Analysis of extra\nobservations found for this event provided new results shading light on the\nflare. This article addresses the observations of this flare with the Siberian\nSolar Radio Telescope (SSRT). Taking advantage of its instrumental\ncharacteristics, we analyze the detailed SSRT observations of a major\nlong-duration flare at 5.7 GHz without cleaning the images. The analysis\nconfirms that the source of GLE63 was associated with an event in active region\n9742 that comprised two flares. The first flare (04:30-05:03 UT) reached a GOES\nimportance of about M1.6. Two microwave sources were observed, whose brightness\ntemperatures at 5.7 GHz exceeded 10 MK. The main flare, up to the M7.1\nimportance, started at 05:04 UT, and occurred in strong magnetic fields. The\nobserved microwave sources reached about 250 MK. They were not static. Having\nappeared on the weaker-field periphery of the active region, the microwave\nsources moved toward each other nearly along the magnetic neutral line,\napproaching a stronger-field core of the active region, and then moved away\nfrom the neutral line like expanding ribbons. These motions rule out an\nassociation of the non-thermal microwave sources with a single flaring loop.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 7 figures. Accepted for publication in Solar Physics"]}]

Unlike Principal Component Analysis, this\nmethod does not assume that the Euclidean distance between galaxy spectra is a\ngood global measure of similarity between all spectra, but instead it only\nassumes that local difference information between similar spectra is reliable.\nMoreover, unlike other nonlinear dimensionality methods, this method can be\nused to characterize very finely both small-scale local as well as large-scale\nglobal properties of realistic noisy data. The power of the method is\ndemonstrated on the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample by illustrating that the derived\nembeddings of spectra carry an unprecedented amount of information. By using a\nstraightforward global or unsupervised variant, we observe that the main\nfeatures correlate strongly with star formation rate and that they clearly\nseparate active galactic nuclei. Computed parameters of the method can be used\nto describe line strengths and their interdependencies. By using a\nlocally-biased or semi-supervised variant, we are able to focus on typical\nvariations around specific objects of astronomical interest. We present several\nexamples illustrating that this approach can enable new discoveries in the data\nas well as a detailed understanding of very fine local structure that would\notherwise be overwhelmed by large-scale noise and global trends in the data.\n","Comment: 34 pages.

The\nco-existence of the two components with distinct absorptions as well as the\ndelayed emergence of the moderately-absorbed X-ray component would be evidence\nfor asphericity of the CSM. We show that the X-ray spectral evolution can be\nqualitatively explained by considering a torus-like geometry for the dense CSM.\nBased on our X-ray spectral analyses, we estimate the radius of the torus-like\nCSM to be on the order of ~5 times 10^{16} cm.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical\n  Journal"]}]

Spectra of heavy ions in many large SEP events show features\nsuch as roll-overs or spectral breaks. In some events when the spectra are\nplotted in energy/nucleon they can be shifted relative to each other to make\nthe spectral breaks align. The amount of shift is charge-to-mass ratio (Q/A)\ndependent and varies from event to event. This can be understood if the spectra\nof heavy ions are organized by the diffusion coefficients (Cohen et al., 2005).\nIn the work of Li et al.

The extreme\ncore-jet morphology is an illusion from a near pole-on line of sight to a\nhighly relativistic jet that produces a Doppler enhanced glow that previously\nswamped the lobe emission. 3C~273 apparently has the intrinsic kpc scale\nmorphology of a classical double radio source, but it is distorted by an\nextreme Doppler aberration.\n","Comment: To appear in ApJ"]}]

We first\nidentify and formalize the symmetry structure in the problem, which enables us\nto show the existence of optimal symmetric solutions.

However,\nthe formation of the corona is still debated. Liu et al. investigated the\nspectrum of the corona heated by the reconnection of the magnetic field\ngenerated by dynamo action in the thin disk and emerging into the corona as a\nresult of buoyancy instability. In the present paper, we improve this model to\ninterpret the observed relation of the hard X-ray spectrum becoming softer at\nhigher accretion rate in luminous AGNs. The magnetic field is characterized by\n$\\beta_{\\rm 0}$, i.e., the ratio of the sum of gas pressure and radiation\npressure to magnetic pressure in the disk ($\\beta_{\\rm 0}=(P_{\\rm g,d}+P_{\\rm\nr,d})/P_{\\rm B}$). Besides, both the intrinsic disk photons and reprocessed\nphotons by the disk are included as the seed photons for inverse Compton\nscattering. These improvements are crucial for investigating the effect of\nmagnetic field on the accretion disk-corona when it is not clear whether the\nradiation pressure or gas pressure dominates in thin disk. We change the value\nof $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ in order to constrain the magnetic field in the accretion\ndisk.

Comparing with the observational results of\nthe hard X-ray bolometric correction factor in a sample of luminous AGNs, we\nsuggest that the value of $\\beta_{\\rm 0}$ is about 100-200 for $\\alpha=0.3$ and\nthe energy fraction $f$ should be larger than $30\\%$ for hard X-ray emission.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 6 figures.

The duration of this formation period can be measured using\nthe ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative\nenrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe]\nprobes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy,\nincluding younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time\nmergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we\nmust study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which\n[Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z~1.4, with\n[Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z~1.6) was probed by\nstacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average\n[Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use\nof index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors\nthat are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at\neven earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full\nspectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern\nshortly after the major star-forming phase (z>2). Here we report a measurement\nof [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1. With [Mg/Fe]=0.59+/-0.11,\nthis galaxy is the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice\nthe Mg enhancement of similar-mass galaxies today. The abundance pattern of the\ngalaxy is consistent with enrichment exclusively by core-collapse supernovae\nand with a star-formation timescale of 0.1-0.5 Gyr - characteristics that are\nsimilar to population II stars in the Milky Way.

It confirms that pure secondary predictions fall\nbelow the data above 10 GeV, suggesting the presence of a primary component,\ne.g. annihilations of WIMPs dark matter. Most analyses have focused on the\nhigh-energy part of the spectrum, disregarding the GeV energy region where\ncosmic ray transport is harder to model and solar modulation comes into play.\nGiven the high quality of AMS measurements, it is timely to re-examine the\npositron anomaly over the entire energy range, taking into account transport\nprocesses so far neglected, e.g. convection or diffusive re-acceleration. We\ndevise a new semi-analytical method to take into account transport processes so\nfar neglected, but important below a few GeV. It is based on the pinching of\ninverse Compton and synchrotron energy losses inside the Galactic disc. It\nallows to carry out extensive scans over the cosmic ray propagation parameters,\nwhich we strongly constrain by requiring that the secondary component does not\novershoot the AMS measurements. Only models with large diffusion coefficients\nsurvive this test. The positron flux is a powerful and independent probe of\ncosmic ray propagation, complementary to the boron-to-carbon ratio. We then\nscan over WIMP mass to fit the annihilation cross section and branching ratios,\nexploring both direct annihilations into standard model particles or through\nlight mediators. In the former case, the best fit yields a $p$-value of 0.4\\%\nfor a mass of 264 GeV, a value that does not allow to reproduce the highest\nenergy data points. Worse quality fits are found in the latter case. The\ninterpretation of the positron excess in terms of single DM species\nannihilations is strongly disfavored.

In the past years, feature learning methods\nthat are applicable to graph-structured data are becoming available, but have\nnot yet widely been applied and evaluated on structured biological knowledge.\nResults: We develop a novel method for feature learning on biological knowledge\ngraphs. Our method combines symbolic methods, in particular knowledge\nrepresentation using symbolic logic and automated reasoning, with neural\nnetworks to generate embeddings of nodes that encode for related information\nwithin knowledge graphs. Through the use of symbolic logic, these embeddings\ncontain both explicit and implicit information. We apply these embeddings to\nthe prediction of edges in the knowledge graph representing problems of\nfunction prediction, finding candidate genes of diseases, protein-protein\ninteractions, or drug target relations, and demonstrate performance that\nmatches and sometimes outperforms traditional approaches based on manually\ncrafted features. Our method can be applied to any biological knowledge graph,\nand will thereby open up the increasing amount of Semantic Web based knowledge\nbases in biology to use in machine learning and data analytics.

Small-scale bright features in the photosphere of the Sun, such as\nfaculae or G-band bright points, appear in connection with small-scale magnetic\nflux concentrations.\n  Aims. Here we report on a new class of photospheric bright points that are\nfree of magnetic fields. So far, these are visible in numerical simulations\nonly. We explore conditions required for their observational detection.\n  Methods. Numerical radiation (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations of the\nnear-surface layers of the Sun were carried out. The magnetic field-free\nsimulations show tiny bright points, reminiscent of magnetic bright points,\nonly smaller. A simple toy model for these non-magnetic bright points (nMBPs)\nwas established that serves as a base for the development of an algorithm for\ntheir automatic detection. Basic physical properties of 357 detected nMBPs were\nextracted and statistically evaluated. We produced synthetic intensity maps\nthat mimic observations with various solar telescopes to obtain hints on their\ndetectability.\n  Results. The nMBPs of the simulations show a mean bolometric intensity\ncontrast with respect to their intergranular surroundings of approximately 20%,\na size of 60-80 km, and the isosurface of optical depth unity is at their\nlocation depressed by 80-100 km.

Similar, frequently occurring funnels\nthat do not reach into the photosphere, do not produce bright points.\n  Conclusions. Non-magnetic bright points are the observable manifestation of\nvertically extending vortices (vortex tubes) in the photosphere.

The goals consisted of studying its atmospheric\ndynamics (Simon et al. 2016), detecting its global acoustic oscillations (Rowe\net al., submitted), and those of the Sun, which we report on here. We present\nthe first indirect detection of solar oscillations in intensity measurements.\nBeyond the remarkable technical performance, it indicates how Kepler would see\na star like the Sun. The result from the global asteroseismic approach, which\nconsists of measuring the oscillation frequency at maximum amplitude \"nu_max\"\nand the mean frequency separation between mode overtones \"Delta nu\", is\nsurprising as the nu_max measured from Neptune photometry is larger than the\naccepted value. Compared to the usual reference nu_max_sun = 3100 muHz, the\nasteroseismic scaling relations therefore make the solar mass and radius appear\nlarger by 13.8 +/- 5.8 % and 4.3 +/- 1.9 % respectively. The higher nu_max is\ncaused by a combination of the value of nu_max_sun, being larger at the time of\nobservations than the usual reference from SOHO/VIRGO/SPM data (3160 +/- 10\nmuHz), and the noise level of the K2 time series, being ten times larger than\nVIRGO's. The peak-bagging method provides more consistent results: despite a\nlow signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we model ten overtones for degrees l=0,1,2. We\ncompare the K2 data with simultaneous SOHO/VIRGO/SPM photometry and BiSON\nvelocity measurements. The individual frequencies, widths, and amplitudes\nmostly match those from VIRGO and BiSON within 1 sigma, except for the few\npeaks with lowest SNR.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table"]}]

Yet, they are believed to\nhave a negligible influence on the structural behavior of most materials. For\nexample, magnetic perovskite oxides often undergo structural transitions\naccompanied by magnetic signatures whose minuteness suggests that the\nunderlying spin-phonon couplings are largely irrelevant. Here we present an\nexception to this rule, showing that novel effects can occur as a consequence.\nOur first-principles calculations reveal that spin-phonon interactions are\nessential to reproduce the experimental observations on the phase diagram of\nmagnetoelectric multiferroic BiCoO$_{3}$. Moreover, we predict that, under\ncompression, these couplings lead to an unprecedented temperature-driven\ndouble-reentrant sequence of ferroelectric transitions. We propose how to\nmodify BiCoO$_{3}$ via chemical doping to reproduce such striking effects at\nambient conditions, thereby yielding useful multifunctionality.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The fragmented\nnetwork view that is widespread in current networks will not stand the\nchallenge posed by next generations of users. A new vision is required, and\nthis paper provides an insight on how network convergence and\napplication-centric approaches will play a leading role towards enabling the 5G\nvision. The paper, after expressing the view on the need for an end-to-end\napproach to network design, brings the reader into a journey on the expected 5G\nnetwork requirements and outlines some of the work currently carried out by\nmain standardisation bodies. It then proposes the use of the concept of network\nconvergence for providing the overall architectural framework to bring together\nall the different technologies within a unifying and coherent network\necosystem. The novel interpretation of multi-dimensional convergence we\nintroduce leads us to the exploration of aspects of node consolidation and\nconverged network architectures, delving into details of optical-wireless\nintegration and future convergence of optical data centre and access-metro\nnetworks. We then discuss how ownership models enabling network sharing will be\ninstrumental in realising the 5G vision. The paper concludes with final remarks\non the role SDN will play in 5G and on the need for new business models that\nreflect the application-centric view of the network. Finally, we provide some\ninsight on growing research areas in 5G networking.\n"]}]

These policies, that are based on the Least-Recently-Used\nreplacement principle, are here referred to as spatial multi-LRU. They update\ncache inventories in a way that provides content diversity to users who are\ncovered by, and thus have access to, more than one station. Two variations are\nproposed, the multi-LRU-One and -All, which differ in the number of replicas\ninserted in the involved caches. We analyse their performance under two types\nof traffic demand, the Independent Reference Model (IRM) and a model that\nexhibits temporal locality. For IRM, we propose a Che-like approximation to\npredict the hit probability, which gives very accurate results. Numerical\nevaluations show that the performance of multi-LRU increases the more the\nmulti-coverage areas increase, and it is close to the performance of\ncentralised policies, when multi-coverage is sufficient. For IRM traffic,\nmulti-LRU-One is preferable to multi-LRU-All, whereas when the traffic exhibits\ntemporal locality the -All variation can perform better. Both variations\noutperform the simple LRU. When popularity knowledge is not accurate, the new\npolicies can perform better than centralised ones.\n","Comment: 14 pages, double column, 5 figures, 15 sub-figures in total. arXiv\n  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1602.07623"]}]
