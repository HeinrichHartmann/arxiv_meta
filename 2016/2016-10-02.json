Strong ME effects are obtained and we show that an\nannealing at 1000$^\\circ$C and a quenching in air improve the piezomagnetic\nbehavior of Zn-rich compositions. A theoretical model that predicts the ME\nbehavior was developed, focusing our work on the demagnetizing effects in the\ntransversal mode as well as the longitudinal mode. The model shows that: (i)\nhigh ME coefficients are obtained when ferrites with high magnetomechanical\ncoupling are used in bilayer ME composites, (ii) the ME behavior in transversal\nand longitudinal modes is quite similar, and differences in the shapes of the\nME curves are mainly due the demagnetizing effects, (iii) in the transversal\nmode, the magnetic field penetration depends on the ferrite layer thickness and\nthe ME coefficient is affected accordingly. The two later points are confirmed\nby measurements on ME samples and calculations. Performances of the ME\ncomposites made with high magnetomechanical coupling ferrites are compared to\nthose obtained using Terfenol-D materials in the same conditions of size,\nshape, and volume ratio. It appears that a ferrite with an optimized\ncomposition has performances comparable to those obtained with Terfenol-D\nmaterial. Nevertheless, the fabrication processes of ferrites are quite\nsimpler. Finally, a ferrite/PZT based ME composite was used as a current\nsensor.\n"]}]

Automatic annotation\ntools are thereforeof the foremost importance to guide biologists' experiments.\nHowever, most of the state-of-the-art methods rely on annotation transfer,\noffering reliable predictions only in homology settings. In this work we\npresent a novel appraoch to protein feature prediction, which exploits the\nSemanti Based Regularization to inject prior knowledge in the learning process.\nThe experimental results conducted on the yeast genome show that the\nintroduction of the constraints positively impacts on the overall prediction\nquality.\n"]}]
