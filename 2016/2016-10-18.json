DPD particles are often thought to represent\npackets of real atoms, and the physical scale probed in DPD models are\ndetermined by the mapping of DPD variables to the corresponding physical\nquantities. However, the non-uniqueness of such mapping has led to difficulties\nin setting up simulations to mimic real systems and in interpreting results.\nFor modeling transport phenomena where thermal fluctuations are important\n(e.g., fluctuating hydrodynamics), an area particularly suited for DPD method,\nwe propose that DPD fluid particles should be viewed as only 1) to provide a\nmedium in which the momentum and energy are transferred according to the\nhydrodynamic laws and 2) to provide objects immersed in the DPD fluids the\nproper random \"kicks\" such that these objects exhibit correct fluctuation\nbehaviors at the macroscopic scale. We show that, in such a case, the choice of\nsystem temperature and mapping of DPD scales to physical scales are uniquely\ndetermined by the level of coarse-graining and properties of DPD fluids.

The fact that both primal and dual\nsolutions are sparse motivates us to develop a randomized approach for a\ngeneral convex-concave optimization problem.

One of these\nspecifications matches the (marginal) law of $\\mathbf{X}(t)$ to that of the\nordered excursion lengths above past minima of $\\{L_{\\mathbf{X}}(s) +ts, \\,s\n\\geq 0\\}$, where $L_{\\mathbf{X}}$ is a certain L\\'evy-type process which\n(modulo shift and scaling) has infinitesimal drift $-s$ at time $s$.\n  Using a modification of the breadth-first-walk construction from Aldous\n(1997) and Aldous and Limic (1998), and some new insight from the thesis by\nUribe (2007), this work settles an open problem (3) from Aldous (1997), in the\nmore general context of Aldous and Limic (1998). Informally speaking,\n$\\mathbf{X}$ is entirely encoded by $L_{\\mathbf{X}}$, and contrary to Aldous'\noriginal intuition, the evolution of time for $\\mathbf{X}$ does correspond to\nthe linear increase in the constant part of the drift of $L_{\\mathbf{X}}$. In\nthe \"standard multiplicative coalescent\" context of Aldous (1997), this result\nwas first announced by Armend\\'ariz in 2001, and obtained in a recent preprint\nby Broutin and Marckert, who simultaneously account for the process of excess\nedge counts (or marks).\n  The novel argument presented here is based on a sequence of relatively\nelementary observations. Some of its components (for example, the new dynamic\nrandom graph construction via \"simultaneous\" breadth-first walks) are of\nindependent interest, and may be useful for obtaining more sophisticated\nasymptotic results on near critical random graphs and related processes.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 4 figures, this is the revision of v1, as promised in the\n  abstract of the (interim) version v2"]}]

Originally developed for meteorology, especially weather\nforecasting, DA is now an accepted technique in various scientific fields. One\nkey issue that remains controversial is the implementation of DA in massive\nsimulation models under limited computation time and resources. In this paper,\nwe propose an adjoint-based DA method for massive autonomous models that\nproduces optimum estimates and their uncertainties within practical computation\ntime and resource constraints. The uncertainties are given as several diagonal\ncomponents of an inverse Hessian matrix, which is the covariance matrix of a\nnormal distribution that approximates the target posterior probability density\nfunction in the neighborhood of the optimum. Conventional algorithms for\nderiving the inverse Hessian matrix require $O(CN^2+N^3)$ computations and\n$O(N^2)$ memory, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom of a given\nautonomous system and $C$ is the number of computations needed to simulate time\nseries of suitable length. The proposed method using a second-order adjoint\nmethod allows us to directly evaluate the diagonal components of the inverse\nHessian matrix without computing all of its components. This drastically\nreduces the number of computations to $O(C)$ and the amount of memory to $O(N)$\nfor each diagonal component. The proposed method is validated through numerical\ntests using a massive two-dimensional Kobayashi's phase-field model. We confirm\nthat the proposed method correctly reproduces the parameter and initial state\nassumed in advance, and successfully evaluates the uncertainty of the\nparameter.

Wang et al.

While incorporating a number of useful features, the\nproposed method only furnishes a point estimate of the regression coefficients;\ntechniques for conducting statistical inference are not provided. A new\nBayesian method is proposed here to overcome this limitation.\n  Results: We develop a Bayesian hierarchical modeling formulation where the\nposterior mode corresponds to the estimator proposed by Wang et al.\n(Bioinformatics, 2012), and an approach that allows for full posterior\ninference including the construction of interval estimates for the regression\nparameters. We show that the proposed hierarchical model can be expressed as a\nthree-level Gaussian scale mixture and this representation facilitates the use\nof a Gibbs sampling algorithm for posterior simulation. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate that the interval estimates obtained using our approach achieve\nadequate coverage probabilities that outperform those obtained from the\nnonparametric bootstrap. Our proposed methodology is applied to the analysis of\nneuroimaging and genetic data collected as part of the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and this analysis of the ADNI cohort\ndemonstrates clearly the value added of incorporating interval estimation\nbeyond only point estimation when relating SNPs to brain imaging\nendophenotypes.\n"]}]

Owing to the preferential formation of stars in stellar clusters, the\nprotoplanetary disks around these stars may potentially be affected by the\ncluster environment. Various works have investigated the influence of stellar\nfly-bys on disks, although many of them consider only the effects due to\nparabolic, coplanar encounters often for equal-mass stars, which is only a very\nspecial case. We perform numerical simulations to study the fate of\nprotoplanetary disks after the impact of parabolic star-disk encounter for the\nless investigated case of inclined up to coplanar, retrograde encounters, which\nis a much more common case. Here, we concentrate on the disk size after such\nencounters because this limits the size of the potentially forming planetary\nsystems. In addition, with the possibilities that ALMA offers, now a direct\ncomparison to observations is possible. Covering a wide range of periastron\ndistances and mass ratios between the mass of the perturber and central star,\nwe find that despite the prograde, coplanar encounters having the strongest\neffect on the disk size, inclined and even the least destructive retrograde\nencounters mostly also have a considerable effect, especially for close\nperiastron passages. Interestingly, we find a nearly linear dependence of the\ndisk size on the orbital inclination for the prograde encounters, but not for\nthe retrograde case. We also determine the final orbital parameters of the\nparticles in the disk such as eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major\naxes. Using this information the presented study can be used to describe the\nfate of disks and also that of planetary systems after inclined encounters.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures.

The version implemented in the LIGO\nAlgorithm Library takes ~0.07s to evaluate for a starting frequency of 30Hz and\n~0.8s for a starting frequency of 10Hz, resulting in a speed-up factor of ~10^3\n- 10^4 relative to the original Matlab code.

In managed languages like Java or\nJavaScript, however, this space-time tradeoff is complex. Using more space\ntranslates into higher garbage collection costs, especially at the limit of\navailable memory. Existing runtime systems provide limited support for\nspace-sensitive algorithms, forcing programmers into difficult and often\nbrittle choices about provisioning.\n  This paper presents prioritized garbage collection, a cooperative programming\nlanguage and runtime solution to this problem. Prioritized GC provides an\ninterface similar to soft references, called priority references, which\nidentify objects that the collector can reclaim eagerly if necessary. The key\ndifference is an API for defining the policy that governs when priority\nreferences are cleared and in what order. Application code specifies a priority\nvalue for each reference and a target memory bound. The collector reclaims\nreferences, lowest priority first, until the total memory footprint of the\ncache fits within the bound. We use this API to implement a space-aware\nleast-recently-used (LRU) cache, called a Sache, that is a drop-in replacement\nfor existing caches, such as Google's Guava library. The garbage collector\nautomatically grows and shrinks the Sache in response to available memory and\nworkload with minimal provisioning information from the programmer.

However, most geometric model fitting methods are unable to\nfit an arbitrary geometric model (e.g. a surface with holes) to incomplete\ndata, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to\nmeasure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models. This paper hence\nproposes a novel rigid geometric similarity metric, which is able to measure\nboth the full similarity and the partial similarity between arbitrary geometric\nmodels. The proposed metric enables us to perform partial procedural geometric\nmodel fitting (PPGMF). The task of PPGMF is to search a procedural geometric\nmodel space for the model rigidly similar to a query of non-complete point set.\nModels in the procedural model space are generated according to a set of\nparametric modeling rules. A typical query is a point cloud. PPGMF is very\nuseful as it can be used to fit arbitrary geometric models to non-complete\n(incomplete, over-complete or hybrid-complete) point cloud data. For example,\nmost laser scanning data is non-complete due to occlusion. Our PPGMF method\nuses Markov chain Monte Carlo technique to optimize the proposed similarity\nmetric over the model space. To accelerate the optimization process, the method\nalso employs a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to reject\ndissimilar models in advance. Our method has been demonstrated on a variety of\ngeometric models and non-complete data.

When we purposely heat the interferometers over a temperature\nrange of 20-50 $^{\\circ}$C, we find that the temperature sensitivity is\ndifferent for each interferometer, likely due to slight manufacturing errors\nduring the temperature compensation procedure. Over this range, we measure a\npath-length shift of 26 $\\pm$ 9 nm/$^{\\circ} $C for the 2.5 GHz interferometer.\nFor the 1.25 GHz interferometer, the path-length shift is nonlinear and is\nlocally equal to zero at a temperature of 37.1 $^{\\circ}$C and is 50 $\\pm$ 17\nnm/$^{\\circ} $C at 22 $^{\\circ}$C. With these devices, we realize a cascade of\n1.25 GHz and 2.5 GHz interferometers to measure four-dimensional classical\nfrequency states created by modulating a stable and continuous-wave laser. We\nobserve a visibility $>99\\%$ over an hour, which is mainly limited by our\nability to precisely generate these states. Overall, our results indicate that\nthese interferometers are well suited for realistic time-frequency quantum\ndistribution protocols.\n"]}]

In this paper, we\nintroduce fuzzy inference systems and neural networks designed to handle bags\nof instances as input and capable of learning from ambiguously labeled data.\nFirst, we introduce the Multiple Instance Sugeno style fuzzy inference\n(MI-Sugeno) that extends the standard Sugeno style inference to handle\nreasoning with multiple instances. Second, we use MI-Sugeno to define and\ndevelop Multiple Instance Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (MI-ANFIS). We\nexpand the architecture of the standard ANFIS to allow reasoning with bags and\nderive a learning algorithm using backpropagation to identify the premise and\nconsequent parameters of the network. The proposed inference system is tested\nand validated using synthetic and benchmark datasets suitable for MIL problems.\nWe also apply the proposed MI-ANFIS to fuse the output of multiple\ndiscrimination algorithms for the purpose of landmine detection using Ground\nPenetrating Radar.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions On Cybernetics for review"]}]

A\ndecoupled impedance model is highly appealing since the\nSingle-Input-Single-Output (SISO) structure makes the analysis and result\ninterpretation very simple.

The most stable isomer (CH3CN)\ninteracts more efficiently with the solid support than the higher energy isomer\n(CH3NC) for water ice and silica. Comparing with the HCN and HNC pair of\nisomers, the simulations show an opposite behaviour, in which isonitrile HNC\nare more strongly adsorbed than nitrile HCN provided that hydrogen bonds are\ncompatible with the nature of the model surface. The present study confirms\nthat the strength of the molecule surface interaction between isomers is not\nrelated to their intrinsic stability but instead to their respective ability to\ngenerate different types of hydrogen bonds.\n","Comment: Astronomy and Astrophysics 2016"]}]

We furnish globularily\ngenerated double category construction with the structure of a functor and we\nprove that this functor is left adjoint to decorated horizontalization functor.\nWe regard this relation as a generalization of relations satisfied by\nhorizontalization functor and trivial double category functor in the theory of\ncategorical structures of second order.\n","Comment: 69 pages"]}]

The innermost regions\ncannot yet be resolved neither in the optical nor in the infrared and it is\nfair to say that we still lack a satisfactory understanding of the physical\nprocesses, geometry and composition of the central (sub-parsec) components of\nAGN. Like spectral or polarimetric observations, the reverberation data needs\nto be modeled in order to infer constraints on the AGN geometry (such as the\ninner radius or the half-opening angle of the dusty torus). In this research\nnote, we present preliminary modeling results using a time-dependent Monte\nCarlo method to solve the radiative transfer in a simplified AGN set up. We\ninvestigate different model configurations using both polarization and time\nlags and find a high dependency on the geometry to the time-lag response. For\nall models there is a clear distinction between edge-on or face-on viewing\nangles for fluxes and time lags, the later showing a higher\nwavelength-dependence than the former. Time lags, polarization and fluxes point\ntoward a clear dichotomy between the different inclinations of AGN, a method\nthat could help us to determine the true orientation of the nucleus in Seyfert\ngalaxies.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, proceeding of the SF2A 2016 meeting"]}]

An adversary presents real-time\nrequests online at points of the metric space, and the algorithm is required to\nmatch them, possibly after keeping them waiting for some time. The cost\nincurred is the sum of the distances between matched pairs of points (the\nconnection cost), and the sum of the waiting times of the requests (the delay\ncost). We present an algorithm with a competitive ratio of $O(\\log n)$, which\nimproves the upper bound of $O(\\log^2n+\\log\\Delta)$ of Emek et al, by removing\nthe dependence on $\\Delta$, the aspect ratio of the metric space (which can be\nunbounded as a function of $n$).
