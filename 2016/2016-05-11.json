This result builds on\nthe intuition that communication with imperfectly shared randomness needs to be\nless sensitive to its random inputs than communication with perfectly shared\nrandomness.

Our experimental results also show that\nchloroquine induces the production of CAGFs in Plasmodium falciparum,\nsuggesting that targeting cell cycle progression can be the primary mechanism\nof chloroquine's antimalarial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory actions.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables"]}]

This separation of scales is instrumental, and it helps to approximate the\nprocess in sufficiently large (but not too large), as a function of $N$, finite\ndomains by a Markov chain. This allows us to establish a deconcentration\nproperty for the sizes of the holes of the frozen clusters around the origin.\n  For the full-plane process, we then show that it can be compared to the\nprocess in large finite domains, so that the deconcentration property also\nholds in this case. In particular, we obtain that with high probability (as $N\n\\to \\infty$), the origin does not belong to a frozen cluster in the final\nconfiguration.\n  This work requires new properties for near-critical percolation, which we\ndevelop along the way, and which are interesting in their own right: in\nparticular, an asymptotic formula involving the percolation probability\n$\\theta(p)$ as $p \\searrow p_c$, and regularity properties for large holes in\nthe infinite cluster.

The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM halos are also\nscale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do\nnot apply to WDM halos: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the\ncharacteristic scale imposed by the power-spectrum suppression. Further, the\nWDM $c({\\rm M},z)$ relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass\nscale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower\nmasses.

We will offer a novel,\npractical and consistent methodology based on a type of MCDA, to aggregate data\nfrom two different sources into a common framework. Two datasets that are\ndifferent in nature but related to the same topic are aggregated to a common\nscale by implementing a set of transformation rules. This allows us to generate\nappropriate evidence for assessing and finally prioritising the level of\nadoption of analytical tools in four types of companies. A numerical example is\nprovided to clarify the form for implementing this methodology. A six-step\nprocess is offered as a guideline to assist engineers, researchers or\npractitioners interested in replicating this methodology in any situation where\nthere is a need to aggregate and transform multiple source data.\n","Comment: Keywords: MCDA methods; evidential reasoning; analytical tools;\n  multiple source data"]}]

These models are usually benchmarked against\ndata from stable beam experiments. In the future, two-step fragmentation\nreactions with exotic nuclei as stepping stones are a promising tool to reach\nthe most neutron-rich nuclei, creating a need for models to describe also these\nreactions.\n  Purpose: We want to extend the presently available data on fragmentation\nreactions towards the light exotic region on the nuclear chart. Furthermore, we\nwant to improve the understanding of projectile fragmentation especially for\nunstable isotopes.\n  Method: We have measured projectile fragments from 10,12-18C and 10-15B\nisotopes colliding with a carbon target. These measurements were all performed\nwithin one experiment, which gives rise to a very consistent dataset. We\ncompare our data to model calculations.\n  Results: One-proton removal cross sections with different final neutron\nnumbers (1pxn) for relativistic 10,12-18C and 10-15B isotopes impinging on a\ncarbon target. Comparing model calculations to the data, we find that EPAX is\nnot able to describe the data satisfactorily. Using ABRABLA07 on the other\nhand, we find that the average excitation energy per abraded nucleon needs to\nbe decreased from 27 MeV to 8.1 MeV. With that decrease ABRABLA07 describes the\ndata surprisingly well.\n  Conclusions: Extending the available data towards light unstable nuclei with\na consistent set of new data have allowed for a systematic investigation of the\nrole of the excitation energy induced in projectile fragmentation. Most\nstriking is the apparent mass dependence of the average excitation energy per\nabraded nucleon. Nevertheless, this parameter, which has been related to\nfinal-state interactions, requires further study.\n"]}]

In addition, the radiation\nfield necessary to power the dust emission in our modeling was compared with\nobservations from GALEX, Sloan, and Spitzer. Our modeling is able to reproduce\nthe observations at MIR and FIR wavelengths, but we found a strong excess of\nemission at submm and mm wavelengths, where the model expectations severely\nunderestimate the LABOCA and Planck fluxes.

The eclipsing binary GU Mon is located in the star-forming cluster\nDolidze 25, which has the lowest metallicity measured in a Milky Way young\ncluster. Aims. GU Mon has been identified as a short-period eclipsing binary\nwith two early B-type components. We set out to derive its orbital and stellar\nparameters. Methods. We present a comprehensive analysis, including B and V\nlight curves and 11 high-resolution spectra, to verify the orbital period and\ndetermine parameters. We use the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND to obtain\nstellar parameters and create templates for cross-correlation. We obtain a\nmodel to fit the light and radial-velocity curves using the Wilson-Devinney\ncode iteratively and simultaneously. Results. The two components of GU Mon are\nidentical stars of spectral type B1 V, with the same mass and temperature. The\nlightcurves are typical of an EW-type binary. The spectroscopic and photometric\nanalyses agree on a period of 0.896640 +- 0.000007 d. We determine a mass of\n9.0 +- 0.6 Msun for each component and temperatures of 28 000 +- 2 000 K. Both\nvalues are consistent with the spectral type. The two stars are overfilling\ntheir respective Roche lobes, sharing a common envelope, and therefore the\norbit is synchronised and circularised. Conclusions. The GU Mon system has a\nfill-out factor above 0.8, containing two dwarf B-type stars on the main\nsequence. The two stars are in a very advanced stage of interaction, with their\nextreme physical similarity likely due to the common envelope.

We investigate the feasibility of planetesimal growth in circumbinary\nprotoplanetary disks around the observed systems Kepler- 16 and Kepler-34 under\nthe gravitational influence of a precessing eccentric gas disk. Methods. We\nembed the results of our previous hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary\ndisks around binaries into an N-body code to perform 3D, high-resolution,\ninter-particle gravity-enabled simulations of planetesimal growth and dynamics\nthat include the gravitational force imparted by the gas. Results. Including\nthe full, precessing asymmetric gas disk generates high eccentricity orbits for\nplanetesimals orbiting at the edge of the circumbinary cavity, where the gas\nsurface density and eccentricity have their largest values. The gas disk is\nable to efficiently align planetesimal pericenters in some regions leading to\nphased, non-interacting orbits. Outside of these areas eccentric planetesimal\norbits become misaligned and overlap leading to crossing orbits and high\nrelative velocities during planetesimal collisions. This can lead to an\nincrease in the number of erosive collisions that far outweighs the number of\ncollisions that result in growth. Gravitational focusing from the static\naxisymmetric gas disk is weak and does not significantly alter collision\noutcomes from the gas free case. Conclusions. Due to asymmetries in the gas\ndisk, planetesimals are strongly perturbed onto highly eccentric orbits. Where\nplanetesimals orbits are not well aligned, orbit crossings lead to an increase\nin the number of erosive collisions. This makes it difficult for sustained\nplanetesimal accretion to occur at the location of Kepler-16b and Kepler-34b\nand we therefore rule out in-situ growth. This adds further support to our\ninitial suggestions that most circumbinary planets should form further out in\nthe disk and migrate inwards.\n","Comment: 12 pages and 12 figures"]}]

High state flares exhibit a narrow range of\namplitudes with a striking cut-off at a maximum amplitude. Optical fluxes\ncorrelate with X-ray fluxes in the high state, but in the low state they are\nanti-correlated. These patterns can be seen clearly in both flux-flux diagrams\nand cross-correlation functions and are consistent between MAXI and GBM.

For\nthe brighter objects of our sample we also investigate their spatial and\nphase-space distribution within the cluster. We argue that the distorted outer\nstructure alone that is seen for some of our objects, is not sufficient to\ndecide whether these systems have a star cluster or a galaxy origin. However,\nwe find that objects with low core concentration and high asymmetry (or high\nellipticity) are primarily located at larger cluster-centric distances as\ncompared to the entire sample. This supports the hypothesis that at least some\nof these objects may originate from tidally stripped galaxies.\n","Comment: Accepted by MNRAS, 19 pages, 10 figures"]}]

When the inputs of the\nPDEs are parameterized by the random variables, the GMsFE basis functions\nusually depend on the random parameters. This leads to a large number degree of\nfreedoms for the mixed GMsFEM and substantially impacts on the computation\nefficiency. In order to overcome the difficulty, we develop reduced mixed GMsFE\nbasis methods such that the multiscale basis functions are independent of the\nrandom parameters and span a low-dimensional space.

In this paper, we take into\nconsideration the problem isolated nodes that are away from the cluster head\n(CH) and by consequence or CH is not within the reach from these nodes. To\nsolve this problem, we propose O-LEACH (Orphan Low Energy Adaptive Clustering\nHierarchy) a routing protocol that takes into account the orphan nodes. Indeed,\na cluster member will be able to play the role of a gateway which allows the\njoining of orphan nodes. Our contribution is to election a cluster head that\nhas enough energy for a better now to coordinate with these member nodes and\nmaintain the full coverage for applications which requires of useful data for\nthe entire area to be covered. The simulation results show that O-LEACH\nperforms better than LEACH in terms of connectivity rate, energy, scalability\nand coverage.\n"]}]

We give\ntwo further applications in the appendix using this idea.\n","Comment: To appear in International Mathematics Research Notices.

In the first part we develop methods\nto obtain exact results in the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence. We consider the AdS_3\nx S^3 x T^4 background with pure Ramond-Ramond flux and we find the all-loop\nworldsheet S-matrix by exploiting the symmetries of the model in light-cone\ngauge. As we naturally include the massless modes on the worldsheet, we derive\nthe full set of Bethe-Yang equations. In the massive sector we give also a\nspin-chain description and we write down solutions compatible with crossing for\nthe scalar factors which are not constrained by simmetries. In the second part\nof the thesis we consider the so-called \"eta-deformation\" of the superstring on\nAdS_5 x S^5. We first discuss the effects of the deformation at the level of\nthe bosonic sigma-model, and we match the tree-level worldsheet scattering\nprocesses to the expansion of the q-deformed S-matrix. To identify the missing\nRamond-Ramond fields we then compute the action quadratic in fermions, and we\nprovide an alternative derivation by looking at the kappa-symmetry variations.\nThe resulting background fields do not solve the equations of motion of type\nIIB supergravity and we comment on this.\n","Comment: Based on the author's PhD thesis. 175 pages"]}]
