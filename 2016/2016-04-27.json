We interpret the formation\nprocess in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI),\nwhich is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our\nsimulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that is\ndivided into two layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with\ntransverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is\ninduced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all\ntimes. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational\nacceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field,\nand size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process.\nBipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of\nparameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher\nstratification until the density contrast becomes around $100$ across the\nturbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux\nconcentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0.1 and 1. The\nmagnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength\nuntil the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the\nturbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to\nbecome stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out\nto be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation,\nwe find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is\nindicative of a hydromagnetic instability. Additionally, the flux\nconcentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging\nflows.

Each node has a risk to fail because of\nlosses resulting from defaulting neighbors, which may lead to large failure\ncascades. Classical risk diversification strategies usually neglect network\neffects and therefore suggest that risk can be reduced if possible losses\n(i.e., exposures) are split among many neighbors (exposure diversification,\nED). But from a complex networks perspective diversification implies higher\nconnectivity of the system as a whole which can also lead to increasing failure\nrisk of a node. To cope with this, we propose a different strategy (damage\ndiversification, DD), i.e. the diversification of losses that are imposed on\nneighboring nodes as opposed to losses incurred by the node itself. Here, we\nquantify the potential of DD to reduce systemic risk in comparison to ED. For\nthis, we develop a branching process approximation that we generalize to\nweighted networks with (almost) arbitrary degree and weight distributions. This\nallows us to identify systemically relevant nodes in a network even if their\ndirected weights differ strongly.

We utilized maxima timings for eleven RRab type stars with\nsuspicious behaviour from the GEOS database, and determined maxima timings from\ndata of sky surveys and our own observations. This significantly extended the\nnumber of suitable maxima timings. We modelled the proposed Light Time Effect\n(LiTE) in O-C diagrams to determine orbital parameters for these systems. In\ncontrast to recent studies, our analysis focused on decades-long periods\ninstead of periods in the order of years. Secondary components were found to be\npredominantly low-mass objects. However, for RZ Cet and AT Ser the mass of the\nsuspected companion of more than one solar mass suggests that it is a massive\nwhite dwarf, a neutron star or even a black hole. We found that the semi-major\naxes of the proposed orbits are between 1 and 20 au. Because the studied stars\nbelong to the closest RR Lyraes, maximal angular distances between components\nduring orbit should at least be between 1 and 13 mas and this improves the\nchance to detect both stars using current telescopes. However, our\ninterpretation of the O-C diagrams as a consequence of the LiTE should be\nconsidered as preliminary without reliable spectroscopic measurements. On the\nother hand our models give a prediction of the period and radial velocity\nevolution which should be sufficient for plausible proof of binarity.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in MNRAS, 18 pages, 18 figures"]}]

Their small\nproduction cross section left doubt as to whether the LHC can effectively probe\nsuch scenarios. Typically, these partners are charged under their own mirror\ncolor gauge group.

These contrasting\noutcomes are governed by a trade-off between aggregate surface area and height.\nOur results provide new insight into biofilm formation and development, and\nreveal new factors that may be at play in the social evolution of biofilm\ncommunities.\n"]}]

The interlayer spin exchange coupling is a few percent of\nin-plane spin exchange terms, confirming $\\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ is close to a 2D\nsystem.

The electrical\nresistance is set by geometrical factors and the resistivity, which is a\nmicroscopic property of the solid. Hydrodynamic fluid flow through channels, in\ncontrast, is determined by geometrical factors, boundary scattering and the\nviscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving internal\ncollisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids, brought into\nfocus by the advent of new calculational techniques, has been whether the\nviscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable role in determining the\nresistance. At first sight this seems unlikely, because in almost all known\nmaterials the rate of momentum-relaxing collisions dominates that of the\nmomentum-conserving ones that give the viscous term.

The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that\nevolves observable functions of the state-space of a dynamical system [Koopman\n1931, PNAS]. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed\nusing dynamic mode decomposition (DMD).

The pulsational properties of\nthe RR Lyrae star ($P=0.645$ d, $\\Delta g = 0.68$ mag) suggest Hydra II may be\na member of the intermediate Oosterhoff or Oosterhoff II group. A comparison\nwith other RR Lyrae stars in ultra--faint systems indicates similar pulsational\nproperties among them, which are different to those found among halo field\nstars and those in the largest of the Milky Way satellites. We also report the\ndiscovery of 31 additional short period variables in the field of view (RR\nLyrae, SX Phe, eclipsing binaries, and a likely anomalous cepheid).

I also discuss the recent progress\nand open questions in our understanding of the role of proton-neutron pairing\nin rotating nuclei at $N\\approx Z$, the physics of band termination and other\nphenomena in rotating nuclei.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 21 figures, chapter 8 in the book \"Relativistic Density\n  Functional for Nuclear Structure\", World Scientific Publishing Company\n  (Singapore), Editor Prof. Jie Meng, in press"]}]

Once a seed BH forms at the center of the galaxy,\nit can grow up to a maximum ~10^5 (T_vir/10^4 K) Msun via gas accretion\nindependent of the initial BH mass. Finally, we discuss possible observational\nsignatures of rapidly accreting BHs with/without allowance for dust. We suggest\nthat these systems could explain Lya emitters without X-rays and luminous\ninfrared sources with hot dust emission, respectively.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

In this paper we present a methodology that has enabled us to\ncollect, identify and annotate a dataset of 330 rumour threads (4,842 tweets)\nassociated with 9 newsworthy events. We analyse this dataset to understand how\nusers spread, support, or deny rumours that are later proven true or false, by\ndistinguishing two levels of status in a rumour life cycle i.e., before and\nafter its veracity status is resolved. The identification of rumours associated\nwith each event, as well as the tweet that resolved each rumour as true or\nfalse, was performed by a team of journalists who tracked the events in real\ntime. Our study shows that rumours that are ultimately proven true tend to be\nresolved faster than those that turn out to be false. Whilst one can readily\nsee users denying rumours once they have been debunked, users appear to be less\ncapable of distinguishing true from false rumours when their veracity remains\nin question. In fact, we show that the prevalent tendency for users is to\nsupport every unverified rumour. We also analyse the role of different types of\nusers, finding that highly reputable users such as news organisations endeavour\nto post well-grounded statements, which appear to be certain and accompanied by\nevidence.

Here, the mathematical correspondence\nbetween the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed\nfrom the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is\ndiscussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate\nSDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be\napplied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the\nfast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic\nflows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive\nKD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and\nthe dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown. This\nsupersymmetry breaking can be regarded as the stochastic generalization of the\nconcept of dynamical chaos. As this supersymmetry breaking happens in both the\ndiffusive and the non-diffusive case, the necessity of the underlying SDE being\nchaotic is given in either case. The observed exponentially growing and\noscillating KD modes prove physically that dynamical spectra of the STS\nevolution operator that break the topological supersymmetry exist with both,\nreal and complex ground state eigenvalues.

Winds\noccur in the Softer (disk-dominated) states of the outburst and are less\nprominent or absent in the Harder (power-law dominated) states. We use\nself-similar magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) accretion-ejection models to explain\nthe disk winds in BHBs. In our models, the density at the base of the outflow\nfrom the accretion disk is not a free parameter, but is determined by solving\nthe full set of dynamical MHD equations. Thus the physical properties of the\noutflow are controlled by the global structure of the disk. We studied\ndifferent MHD solutions characterized by different values of (a) the disk\naspect ratio ($\\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). We use two\nkinds of MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence\n(warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. Such heating could be from e.g.\ndissipation of energy due to MHD turbulence in the disk or from illumination.\nWe use each of these MHD solutions to predict the physical parameters of an\noutflow; put limits on the ionization parameter ($\\xi$), column density and\ntimescales, motivated by observational results; and thus select regions within\nthe outflow which are consistent with the observed winds. The cold MHD\nsolutions cannot account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. But\nwarm solutions can explain the observed physical quantities in the wind because\nthey can have sufficiently high values of $p$ ($\\gtrsim 0.1$, implying larger\nmass loading at the base of the outflow). Further from our thermodynamic\nequilibrium curve analysis for the outflowing gas, we found that in the Hard\nstate a range of $\\xi$ is thermodynamically unstable, and had to be excluded.\nThis constrain made it impossible to have any wind at all, in the Hard state.\n","Comment: 16 Pages, 10 figures in the main body and 4 figures in the appendix.\n  Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Only\nmarginal $^{12}$CO(6-5) emission is detected in the vicinity of the expanding\nshells at the eastern and western edges of the disk. While the eastern shell\ncontains gas even warmer (T$_{\\rm kin}$>300~K) than the hot gas component\n(T$_{\\rm kin}$=300K) of the disk, the western shell is surrounded by gas much\ncooler (T$_{\\rm kin}$=60K) than the eastern shell but somewhat hotter than the\ncold gas component of the disk (for similar H$_2$ and CO column densities),\nindicative of different (or differently efficient) heating mechansisms. The\ncontinuum emission at 686GHz in the disk agrees well in shape and size with\nthat at lower (sub-)millimeter frequencies, exhibiting a spectral index\nconsistent with thermal dust emission. We find dust temperatures of ~10-30K and\nlargely optically thin emission. However, our fits suggest a second (more\noptically thick) dust component at higher temperatures (T$_{\\rm d}$>60K),\nsimilar to the molecular gas. We estimate a global dust mass of ~10$^6$Msun for\nthe disk translating into a gas-to-dust mass ratio of a few hundred consistent\nwith other nearby active galaxies.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in ApJ, 21 pages, 12 Figures, 6 Tables;\n  acknowledgements updated in revised version"]}]

The former\nbreaks down into three further sub-cores: W51e2-W, which surrounds the well\nknown HC HII region, where hot ammonia is observed in absorption, and two\nadditional dusty cores, W51e2-E (~0.8\" to the East) and W51e2-NW (~1\" to the\nNorth), where hot ammonia is observed in emission. The velocity maps towards\nthe HC HII region show a clear velocity gradient that may indicate rotation,\nthough we do not directly observe a Keplerian velocity profile. The absence of\noutflow and/or maser activity and the low amount of molecular gas available for\naccretion (~5 solar masses) with respect to the mass of the central YSO (>20\nsolar masses), both indicate that the central YSO has already accreted most of\nits final mass. On the other hand, in the nearby W51e2-E object, the relatively\nlarge amount of hot molecular gas available for accretion (~20 solar masses,\nwithin about half an arcsecond or 2500 AU), along with strong outflow and maser\nactivity, indicates that the main accretion center in the W51e2 complex is\nW51e2-E rather than W51e2-W. Finally, W51e2-NW and W51e8, although less dense,\nare also hot cores and contain a significant amount of molecular gas (~30 and\n70 solar masses, respectively).

We examine the difference between the flare rates observed in close\nWD+dM binary systems and field dMs. Our sample consists of a subset of 181\nclose WD+dM pairs from Morgan et al. (2012) observed in the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey Stripe 82, where we obtain multi-epoch observations in the Sloan\nugriz-bands. We find an increase in the overall flaring fraction in the close\nWD+dM pairs (0.09$\\pm$0.03%) compared to the field dMs (0.0108$\\pm$0.0007%;\nKowalski et al. 2009) and a lower flaring fraction for active WD+dMs\n(0.05$\\pm$0.03%) compared to active dMs (0.28$\\pm$0.05%; Kowalski et al. 2009).\nWe discuss how our results constrain both the single and binary dM flare rates.\nOur results also constrain dM multiplicity, our knowledge of the Galactic\ntransient background, and may be important for the habitability of attending\nplanets around dMs with close companions.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures"]}]

In the mean\ntime, disk mass loss has been conventionally attributed to photoevaporation,\nwhich controls disk dispersal. However, a paradigm shift towards accretion\ndriven by magnetized disk winds has been realized in the recent years, thanks\nto studies of non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic effects in PPDs. I present a\nframework of global PPD evolution aiming to incorporate these advances,\nhighlighting the role of wind-driven accretion and wind mass loss. Disk\nevolution is found to be largely dominated by wind-driven processes, and\nviscous spreading is suppressed. The timescale of disk evolution is controlled\nprimarily by the amount of external magnetic flux threading the disks, and how\nrapidly the disk loses the flux. Rapid disk dispersal can be achieved if the\ndisk is able to hold most of its magnetic flux during the evolution. In\naddition, because wind launching requires sufficient level of ionization at\ndisk surface (mainly via external far-UV radiation), wind kinematics is also\naffected by far-UV penetration depth and disk geometry. For typical disk\nlifetime of a few Myrs, the disk loses approximately the same amount of mass\nthrough the wind as through accretion onto the protostar, and most of the wind\nmass loss proceeds from the outer disk via a slow wind. Fractional wind mass\nloss increases with increasing disk lifetime. Significant wind mass loss likely\nsubstantially enhances the dust to gas mass ratio, and promotes planet\nformation.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ApJ"]}]

However, details of the past merger history of present-day\nellipticals, such as the typical merger mass ratio, are difficult to constrain\nobservationally.

We study a sample of nearby massive elliptical\ngalaxies selected from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, using two-dimensional\nanalysis to decompose their light distribution into an inner, denser component\nplus an extended, outer envelope, each having a different optical color. The\ncombination of these two substructures accurately recovers the negative color\ngradient exhibited by the galaxy as whole. The color difference between the two\ncomponents (<\\Delta(B-V)> ~ 0.10 mag; <\\Delta(B-R)> ~ 0.14 mag), based on the\nslope of the M_stellar-color relation for nearby early-type galaxies, can be\ntranslated into an estimate of the average mass ratio of the mergers. The rough\nestimate, 1:5 to 1:10, is consistent with the expectation of the two-phase\nformation scenario, suggesting that minor mergers were largely responsible for\nbuilding up to the outer stellar envelope of present-day massive ellipticals.\nWith the help of accurate photometry, large sample size, and more choices of\ncolors promised by ongoing and future surveys, the approach proposed here can\nreveal more insights into the growth of massive galaxies during the last few\nGyr.\n","Comment: Accepted by ApJ; 20 pages, 11 figures, 1 table; The high resolution\n  figures and the full table can be downloaded from here:\n  https://github.com/dr-guangtou/cgs_colorgrad"]}]

As $B$ increases,\nmore and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, though $g_{n}$\ndecreases with the Landau level number $n$. The enhanced $n_{e}$ in a SMF means\nan increase in the electron Fermi energy and an increase in the electron\ndegeneracy pressure. The results are expected to facilitate the study of the\nweak-interaction processes inside neutron stars and the magnetic-thermal\nevolution mechanism for megnetars.\n","Comment: One Table and four figures, published in Mod.

In dynamic\natmosphere and wind models, the stellar pulsation is often simulated by\nprescribing a simple sinusoidal variation in velocity and luminosity at the\ninner boundary of the model atmosphere. We experiment with different forms of\nthe luminosity variation in order to assess the effects on the wind velocity\nand mass-loss rate, when progressing from the simple sinusoidal recipe towards\nmore realistic descriptions. Using state-of-the-art dynamical models of C-rich\nAGB stars, a range of different asymmetric shapes of the luminosity variation\nand a range of phase shifts of the luminosity variation relative to the radial\nvariation are tested. These tests are performed on two stellar atmosphere\nmodels. The first model has dust condensation and, as a consequence, a stellar\nwind is triggered, while the second model lacks both dust and wind. The first\nmodel with dust and stellar wind is very sensitive to moderate changes in the\nluminosity variation. There is a complex relationship between the luminosity\nminimum, and dust condensation: changing the phase corresponding to minimum\nluminosity can either increase or decrease mass-loss rate and wind velocity.\nThe luminosity maximum dominates the radiative pressure on the dust, which in\nturn, is important for driving the wind. These effects of changed luminosity\nvariation are coupled with the dust formation. In contrast there is very little\nchange to the structure of the model without dust. Changing the luminosity\nvariation, both by introducing a phase shift and by modifying the shape,\ninfluences wind velocity and the mass-loss rate. To improve wind models it\nwould probably be desirable to extract boundary conditions from 3D dynamical\ninterior models or stellar pulsation models.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

To detect activity cycles in solar-analog\nstars and determine if these can be identified through other optical lines,\nsuch as Fe II and Balmer lines.

Additionally in May~2013, we obtained new HST/COS ultraviolet\nobservations that displayed unexpected behaviour: besides showing variability\nat ~275s, which is close to the post-outburst pulsations detected with HST in\n2010 and 2011, the white dwarf exhibits high-amplitude variability on a ~4.4h\ntime-scale. We demonstrate that this variability is produced by an increase of\nthe temperature of a region on white dwarf covering up to ~30 per cent of the\nvisible white dwarf surface. We argue against a short-lived accretion episode\nas the explanation of such heating, and discuss this event in the context of\nnon-radial pulsations on a rapidly rotating star\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, accpted in MNRAS"]}]

Our near-IR spectroscopy has identified six\nultracool dwarfs (M6$-$L4; $\\approx$30$-$100 M$_{Jup}$) with intermediate\nsurface gravities (INT-G) as candidate members of the AB Dor Moving Group. We\nfind another two candidate members with spectra showing hints of youth but\nconsistent with field gravities.

This\ninequality is obeyed by every SEnM computation and also imposes a critical\ncondition on QC: if the hypothesis holds, the inequality should be satisfied by\nQC for the SEnM imitating it. However, QC can violate the inequality, and the\nabove hypothesis is generally not accepted.

Part I of this\npaper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price\ndynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns\non the future order flow. However, impact models presented in Part I consider\nthe order flow as an exogenous process, only characterized by its two-point\ncorrelations. This assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the\nmodel. Here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a\nso-called Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) framework, introduced\noriginally by Raftery (1985).

The MTD represents a parsimonious approximation of a full high-order\nMarkov chain. The new approach captures with adequate realism the conditional\ncorrelation functions between signed events for both small and large tick\nstocks and signature plots. From a methodological viewpoint, we discuss a novel\nand flexible way to calibrate a large class of MTD models with a very large\nnumber of parameters.

The accuracy of PCEs degenerates quickly in time. Thus maintaining a\nsufficient level of long term accuracy requires the use of high-order\npolynomials. In numerous cases, it is even infeasible to obtain accurate\nmetamodels with regular PCEs due to the fact that PCEs cannot represent the\ndynamics.

One of the reasons for this is the lack of design\nautomation tools, which will facilitate the systematic design of large QCA\ncircuits that contemporary applications demand. Here we present novel,\nprogrammable QCA circuits, which are based on crossbar architecture. These\ncircuits can be programmed to implement any Boolean function in analogy to CMOS\nFPGAs and open the road that will lead to full design automation of QCA\nnanoelectronic circuits.

Indirect encodings can potentially answer this\nchallenge. Yet in practice, indirect encodings do not yield effective\nmultimodal controllers. Thus, this paper introduces novel multimodal extensions\nto HyperNEAT, a popular indirect encoding. A previous multimodal HyperNEAT\napproach called situational policy geometry assumes that multiple brains\nbenefit from being embedded within an explicit geometric space. However,\nexperiments here illustrate that this assumption unnecessarily constrains\nevolution, resulting in lower performance. Specifically, this paper introduces\nHyperNEAT extensions for evolving many brains without assuming geometric\nrelationships between them. The resulting Multi-Brain HyperNEAT can exploit\nhuman-specified task divisions to decide when each brain controls the agent, or\ncan automatically discover when brains should be used, by means of preference\nneurons. A further extension called module mutation allows evolution to\ndiscover the number of brains, enabling multimodal behavior with even less\nexpert knowledge. Experiments in several multimodal domains highlight that\nmulti-brain approaches are more effective than HyperNEAT without multimodal\nextensions, and show that brains without a geometric relation to each other\noutperform situational policy geometry. The conclusion is that Multi-Brain\nHyperNEAT provides several promising techniques for evolving complex multimodal\nbehavior.\n"]}]
