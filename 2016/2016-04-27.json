We interpret the formation\nprocess in terms of negative effective magnetic pressure instability (NEMPI),\nwhich is a possible mechanism to explain the origin of sunspots. In our\nsimulations, we use a Cartesian domain of isothermal stratified gas that is\ndivided into two layers. In the lower layer, turbulence is forced with\ntransverse nonhelical random waves, whereas in the upper layer no flow is\ninduced. A weak uniform magnetic field is imposed in the entire domain at all\ntimes. In this study we vary the stratification by changing the gravitational\nacceleration, magnetic Reynolds number, strength of the imposed magnetic field,\nand size of the domain to investigate their influence on the formation process.\nBipolar magnetic structure formation takes place over a large range of\nparameters. The magnetic structures become more intense for higher\nstratification until the density contrast becomes around $100$ across the\nturbulent layer. For the Reynolds numbers considered, magnetic flux\nconcentrations are generated at magnetic Prandtl number between 0.1 and 1. The\nmagnetic field in bipolar regions increases with higher imposed field strength\nuntil the field becomes comparable to the equipartition field strength of the\nturbulence. A larger horizontal extent enables the flux concentrations to\nbecome stronger and more coherent. The size of the bipolar structures turns out\nto be independent of the domain size. In the case of bipolar region formation,\nwe find an exponential growth of the large-scale magnetic field, which is\nindicative of a hydromagnetic instability. Additionally, the flux\nconcentrations are correlated with strong large-scale downward and converging\nflows.

Each node has a risk to fail because of\nlosses resulting from defaulting neighbors, which may lead to large failure\ncascades. Classical risk diversification strategies usually neglect network\neffects and therefore suggest that risk can be reduced if possible losses\n(i.e., exposures) are split among many neighbors (exposure diversification,\nED). But from a complex networks perspective diversification implies higher\nconnectivity of the system as a whole which can also lead to increasing failure\nrisk of a node. To cope with this, we propose a different strategy (damage\ndiversification, DD), i.e. the diversification of losses that are imposed on\nneighboring nodes as opposed to losses incurred by the node itself. Here, we\nquantify the potential of DD to reduce systemic risk in comparison to ED. For\nthis, we develop a branching process approximation that we generalize to\nweighted networks with (almost) arbitrary degree and weight distributions. This\nallows us to identify systemically relevant nodes in a network even if their\ndirected weights differ strongly.

We utilized maxima timings for eleven RRab type stars with\nsuspicious behaviour from the GEOS database, and determined maxima timings from\ndata of sky surveys and our own observations. This significantly extended the\nnumber of suitable maxima timings. We modelled the proposed Light Time Effect\n(LiTE) in O-C diagrams to determine orbital parameters for these systems. In\ncontrast to recent studies, our analysis focused on decades-long periods\ninstead of periods in the order of years. Secondary components were found to be\npredominantly low-mass objects. However, for RZ Cet and AT Ser the mass of the\nsuspected companion of more than one solar mass suggests that it is a massive\nwhite dwarf, a neutron star or even a black hole. We found that the semi-major\naxes of the proposed orbits are between 1 and 20 au. Because the studied stars\nbelong to the closest RR Lyraes, maximal angular distances between components\nduring orbit should at least be between 1 and 13 mas and this improves the\nchance to detect both stars using current telescopes. However, our\ninterpretation of the O-C diagrams as a consequence of the LiTE should be\nconsidered as preliminary without reliable spectroscopic measurements. On the\nother hand our models give a prediction of the period and radial velocity\nevolution which should be sufficient for plausible proof of binarity.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in MNRAS, 18 pages, 18 figures"]}]

Their small\nproduction cross section left doubt as to whether the LHC can effectively probe\nsuch scenarios. Typically, these partners are charged under their own mirror\ncolor gauge group.

These contrasting\noutcomes are governed by a trade-off between aggregate surface area and height.\nOur results provide new insight into biofilm formation and development, and\nreveal new factors that may be at play in the social evolution of biofilm\ncommunities.\n"]}]

The electrical\nresistance is set by geometrical factors and the resistivity, which is a\nmicroscopic property of the solid. Hydrodynamic fluid flow through channels, in\ncontrast, is determined by geometrical factors, boundary scattering and the\nviscosity of the fluid, which is governed by momentum-conserving internal\ncollisions. A long-standing question in the physics of solids, brought into\nfocus by the advent of new calculational techniques, has been whether the\nviscosity of the electron fluid plays an observable role in determining the\nresistance. At first sight this seems unlikely, because in almost all known\nmaterials the rate of momentum-relaxing collisions dominates that of the\nmomentum-conserving ones that give the viscous term.

The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that\nevolves observable functions of the state-space of a dynamical system [Koopman\n1931, PNAS]. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed\nusing dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the\nstate variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too\nrestrictive for nonlinear systems [Williams et al. 2015, JNLS]. Choosing\nnonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is\npossible to obtain linear models, especially those that are useful for control,\nis an open challenge.\n  Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis\nthat enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems.\nFirst, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic\nregulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the\nobservable subspace, as in DMD.

The dust\nevolution in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P supernovae and their remnants\nis also studied. We study oxygen-rich clumps that describe the ejecta oxygen\ncore, and carbon-rich clumps that correspond to the outermost carbon-rich\nejecta zone. We consider the dust components formed in the supernova, several\nreverse shock velocities and inter-clump gas temperatures, and derive dust\ngrain size distributions and masses as a function of time. We find that\nnon-thermal sputtering in clumps is important and accounts for reducing the\ngrain population by ~ 40% to 80% in mass, depending on the clump gas\nover-density and the grain type and size. A Type II-b supernova forms small\ngrains that are sputtered within clumps and in the inter-clump medium. For Cas\nA, silicate grains do not survive thermal sputtering in the inter-clump medium.\nOur derived masses of currently processed silicate, alumina and carbon grains\nin Cas A agree well with values derived from observations. Grains produced by\nType II-P supernovae better survive the remnant phase. For dense ejecta clumps,\ndust survival efficiencies range between 42% and 98% in mass. For the SN1987A\nmodel, the derived surviving dust mass is in the range ~ 0.06-0.13 Msolar. This\ntype of dense supernovae may efficiently provide galaxies with dust.\nSpecifically, silicate grains over 0.1 micron and other grains over 0,05 micron\nsurvive thermal sputtering in the remnant. Therefore, pre-solar grains of\nsupernova origin possibly form in the dense ejecta clumps of Type II-P\nsupernovae.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

Here, the mathematical correspondence\nbetween the KD and a specific stochastic differential equation (SDE) viewed\nfrom the perspective of the supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) is\ndiscussed. The STS is a novel, approximation-free framework to investigate\nSDEs. The correspondence reported here permits insights from the STS to be\napplied to the theory of KD and vice versa. It was previously known that the\nfast KD in the idealistic limit of no magnetic diffusion requires chaotic\nflows. The KD-STS correspondence shows that this is also true for the diffusive\nKD. From the STS perspective, the KD possesses a topological supersymmetry and\nthe dynamo effect can be viewed as its spontaneous breakdown. This\nsupersymmetry breaking can be regarded as the stochastic generalization of the\nconcept of dynamical chaos. As this supersymmetry breaking happens in both the\ndiffusive and the non-diffusive case, the necessity of the underlying SDE being\nchaotic is given in either case. The observed exponentially growing and\noscillating KD modes prove physically that dynamical spectra of the STS\nevolution operator that break the topological supersymmetry exist with both,\nreal and complex ground state eigenvalues.

Winds\noccur in the Softer (disk-dominated) states of the outburst and are less\nprominent or absent in the Harder (power-law dominated) states. We use\nself-similar magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) accretion-ejection models to explain\nthe disk winds in BHBs. In our models, the density at the base of the outflow\nfrom the accretion disk is not a free parameter, but is determined by solving\nthe full set of dynamical MHD equations. Thus the physical properties of the\noutflow are controlled by the global structure of the disk. We studied\ndifferent MHD solutions characterized by different values of (a) the disk\naspect ratio ($\\varepsilon$) and (b) the ejection efficiency ($p$). We use two\nkinds of MHD solutions depending on the absence (cold solution) or presence\n(warm solution) of heating at the disk surface. Such heating could be from e.g.\ndissipation of energy due to MHD turbulence in the disk or from illumination.\nWe use each of these MHD solutions to predict the physical parameters of an\noutflow; put limits on the ionization parameter ($\\xi$), column density and\ntimescales, motivated by observational results; and thus select regions within\nthe outflow which are consistent with the observed winds. The cold MHD\nsolutions cannot account for winds due to their low ejection efficiency. But\nwarm solutions can explain the observed physical quantities in the wind because\nthey can have sufficiently high values of $p$ ($\\gtrsim 0.1$, implying larger\nmass loading at the base of the outflow). Further from our thermodynamic\nequilibrium curve analysis for the outflowing gas, we found that in the Hard\nstate a range of $\\xi$ is thermodynamically unstable, and had to be excluded.\nThis constrain made it impossible to have any wind at all, in the Hard state.\n","Comment: 16 Pages, 10 figures in the main body and 4 figures in the appendix.\n  Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Only\nmarginal $^{12}$CO(6-5) emission is detected in the vicinity of the expanding\nshells at the eastern and western edges of the disk. While the eastern shell\ncontains gas even warmer (T$_{\\rm kin}$>300~K) than the hot gas component\n(T$_{\\rm kin}$=300K) of the disk, the western shell is surrounded by gas much\ncooler (T$_{\\rm kin}$=60K) than the eastern shell but somewhat hotter than the\ncold gas component of the disk (for similar H$_2$ and CO column densities),\nindicative of different (or differently efficient) heating mechansisms. The\ncontinuum emission at 686GHz in the disk agrees well in shape and size with\nthat at lower (sub-)millimeter frequencies, exhibiting a spectral index\nconsistent with thermal dust emission. We find dust temperatures of ~10-30K and\nlargely optically thin emission. However, our fits suggest a second (more\noptically thick) dust component at higher temperatures (T$_{\\rm d}$>60K),\nsimilar to the molecular gas.

Using the JVLA, we have mapped the\nhot and dense molecular gas in W51 Main, with about 0.2 arcsec angular\nresolution, in five highly-excited metastable inversion transitions of ammonia\n(ammonia): (J,K)=(6,6), (7,7), (9,9), (10,10), and (13,13). We have identified\nand characterised two main centers of high-mass star formation in W51-Main: the\nW51e2 complex and the W51e8 core (6 arcsec southward of W51e2). The former\nbreaks down into three further sub-cores: W51e2-W, which surrounds the well\nknown HC HII region, where hot ammonia is observed in absorption, and two\nadditional dusty cores, W51e2-E (~0.8\" to the East) and W51e2-NW (~1\" to the\nNorth), where hot ammonia is observed in emission. The velocity maps towards\nthe HC HII region show a clear velocity gradient that may indicate rotation,\nthough we do not directly observe a Keplerian velocity profile. The absence of\noutflow and/or maser activity and the low amount of molecular gas available for\naccretion (~5 solar masses) with respect to the mass of the central YSO (>20\nsolar masses), both indicate that the central YSO has already accreted most of\nits final mass. On the other hand, in the nearby W51e2-E object, the relatively\nlarge amount of hot molecular gas available for accretion (~20 solar masses,\nwithin about half an arcsecond or 2500 AU), along with strong outflow and maser\nactivity, indicates that the main accretion center in the W51e2 complex is\nW51e2-E rather than W51e2-W. Finally, W51e2-NW and W51e8, although less dense,\nare also hot cores and contain a significant amount of molecular gas (~30 and\n70 solar masses, respectively).

Simulations of the cooling and\ncontraction were conducted for ice giants with masses of 5, 10, 20, and 50\nMearth that are located at 280, 700, and 1120 AU from the Sun. The core\ncomposition, the fraction of H/He, the efficiency of energy transport, and the\ninitial luminosity were varied. The atmospheric opacity was set to 1, 50, and\n100 times solar metallicity. We find for a nominal 10 Mearth planet at 700 AU\nat the current age of the solar system an effective temperature of 47 K, much\nhigher than the equilibrium temperature of about 10 K, a radius of 3.7 Rearth,\nand an intrinsic luminosity of 0.006 Ljupiter.

If candidate Planet 9 has a significant H/He layer and an efficient\nenergy transport in the interior, then its luminosity is dominated by the\nintrinsic contribution, making it a self-luminous planet.

Disk\nevolution is found to be largely dominated by wind-driven processes, and\nviscous spreading is suppressed. The timescale of disk evolution is controlled\nprimarily by the amount of external magnetic flux threading the disks, and how\nrapidly the disk loses the flux. Rapid disk dispersal can be achieved if the\ndisk is able to hold most of its magnetic flux during the evolution. In\naddition, because wind launching requires sufficient level of ionization at\ndisk surface (mainly via external far-UV radiation), wind kinematics is also\naffected by far-UV penetration depth and disk geometry. For typical disk\nlifetime of a few Myrs, the disk loses approximately the same amount of mass\nthrough the wind as through accretion onto the protostar, and most of the wind\nmass loss proceeds from the outer disk via a slow wind. Fractional wind mass\nloss increases with increasing disk lifetime.

However, details of the past merger history of present-day\nellipticals, such as the typical merger mass ratio, are difficult to constrain\nobservationally. Within the context and assumptions of the two-phase formation\nscenario, we propose a straightforward method, using photometric data alone, to\nestimate the average mass ratio of mergers that contributed to the build-up of\nmassive elliptical galaxies. We study a sample of nearby massive elliptical\ngalaxies selected from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, using two-dimensional\nanalysis to decompose their light distribution into an inner, denser component\nplus an extended, outer envelope, each having a different optical color. The\ncombination of these two substructures accurately recovers the negative color\ngradient exhibited by the galaxy as whole. The color difference between the two\ncomponents (<\\Delta(B-V)> ~ 0.10 mag; <\\Delta(B-R)> ~ 0.14 mag), based on the\nslope of the M_stellar-color relation for nearby early-type galaxies, can be\ntranslated into an estimate of the average mass ratio of the mergers. The rough\nestimate, 1:5 to 1:10, is consistent with the expectation of the two-phase\nformation scenario, suggesting that minor mergers were largely responsible for\nbuilding up to the outer stellar envelope of present-day massive ellipticals.\nWith the help of accurate photometry, large sample size, and more choices of\ncolors promised by ongoing and future surveys, the approach proposed here can\nreveal more insights into the growth of massive galaxies during the last few\nGyr.\n","Comment: Accepted by ApJ; 20 pages, 11 figures, 1 table; The high resolution\n  figures and the full table can be downloaded from here:\n  https://github.com/dr-guangtou/cgs_colorgrad"]}]

As $B$ increases,\nmore and more electrons will occupy higher Landau levels, though $g_{n}$\ndecreases with the Landau level number $n$. The enhanced $n_{e}$ in a SMF means\nan increase in the electron Fermi energy and an increase in the electron\ndegeneracy pressure. The results are expected to facilitate the study of the\nweak-interaction processes inside neutron stars and the magnetic-thermal\nevolution mechanism for megnetars.\n","Comment: One Table and four figures, published in Mod.

In dynamic\natmosphere and wind models, the stellar pulsation is often simulated by\nprescribing a simple sinusoidal variation in velocity and luminosity at the\ninner boundary of the model atmosphere. We experiment with different forms of\nthe luminosity variation in order to assess the effects on the wind velocity\nand mass-loss rate, when progressing from the simple sinusoidal recipe towards\nmore realistic descriptions. Using state-of-the-art dynamical models of C-rich\nAGB stars, a range of different asymmetric shapes of the luminosity variation\nand a range of phase shifts of the luminosity variation relative to the radial\nvariation are tested. These tests are performed on two stellar atmosphere\nmodels. The first model has dust condensation and, as a consequence, a stellar\nwind is triggered, while the second model lacks both dust and wind. The first\nmodel with dust and stellar wind is very sensitive to moderate changes in the\nluminosity variation. There is a complex relationship between the luminosity\nminimum, and dust condensation: changing the phase corresponding to minimum\nluminosity can either increase or decrease mass-loss rate and wind velocity.\nThe luminosity maximum dominates the radiative pressure on the dust, which in\nturn, is important for driving the wind. These effects of changed luminosity\nvariation are coupled with the dust formation. In contrast there is very little\nchange to the structure of the model without dust. Changing the luminosity\nvariation, both by introducing a phase shift and by modifying the shape,\ninfluences wind velocity and the mass-loss rate. To improve wind models it\nwould probably be desirable to extract boundary conditions from 3D dynamical\ninterior models or stellar pulsation models.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

To detect activity cycles in solar-analog\nstars and determine if these can be identified through other optical lines,\nsuch as Fe II and Balmer lines. We study the solar-analog star HD 45184.\nMethods. We analyse the activity signatures of HD 45184 by using 291 HARPS\nspectra obtained between 2003 and 2014.

This\ninequality is obeyed by every SEnM computation and also imposes a critical\ncondition on QC: if the hypothesis holds, the inequality should be satisfied by\nQC for the SEnM imitating it. However, QC can violate the inequality, and the\nabove hypothesis is generally not accepted.

Part I of this\npaper reported the remarkable improvements in the description of the price\ndynamics which can be obtained when one incorporates the impact of past returns\non the future order flow. However, impact models presented in Part I consider\nthe order flow as an exogenous process, only characterized by its two-point\ncorrelations. This assumption seriously limits the forecasting ability of the\nmodel. Here we attempt to model directly the stream of discrete events with a\nso-called Mixture Transition Distribution (MTD) framework, introduced\noriginally by Raftery (1985). We distinguish between price-changing and non\nprice-changing events and combine them with the order sign in order to reduce\nthe order flow dynamics to the dynamics of a four-state discrete random\nvariable. The MTD represents a parsimonious approximation of a full high-order\nMarkov chain. The new approach captures with adequate realism the conditional\ncorrelation functions between signed events for both small and large tick\nstocks and signature plots. From a methodological viewpoint, we discuss a novel\nand flexible way to calibrate a large class of MTD models with a very large\nnumber of parameters. In spite of this large number of parameters, an\nout-of-sample analysis confirms that the model does not overfit the data.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 7 figures, and 1 table"]}]

The accuracy of PCEs degenerates quickly in time. Thus maintaining a\nsufficient level of long term accuracy requires the use of high-order\npolynomials. In numerous cases, it is even infeasible to obtain accurate\nmetamodels with regular PCEs due to the fact that PCEs cannot represent the\ndynamics.

Indirect encodings can potentially answer this\nchallenge. Yet in practice, indirect encodings do not yield effective\nmultimodal controllers. Thus, this paper introduces novel multimodal extensions\nto HyperNEAT, a popular indirect encoding. A previous multimodal HyperNEAT\napproach called situational policy geometry assumes that multiple brains\nbenefit from being embedded within an explicit geometric space. However,\nexperiments here illustrate that this assumption unnecessarily constrains\nevolution, resulting in lower performance. Specifically, this paper introduces\nHyperNEAT extensions for evolving many brains without assuming geometric\nrelationships between them. The resulting Multi-Brain HyperNEAT can exploit\nhuman-specified task divisions to decide when each brain controls the agent, or\ncan automatically discover when brains should be used, by means of preference\nneurons. A further extension called module mutation allows evolution to\ndiscover the number of brains, enabling multimodal behavior with even less\nexpert knowledge. Experiments in several multimodal domains highlight that\nmulti-brain approaches are more effective than HyperNEAT without multimodal\nextensions, and show that brains without a geometric relation to each other\noutperform situational policy geometry. The conclusion is that Multi-Brain\nHyperNEAT provides several promising techniques for evolving complex multimodal\nbehavior.\n"]}]
