The method is inspired by the\ntheory of nonlocality of physical interactions and utilizes the relevant\nformalism. We formulate the ISP as a problem whose goal is to determine an\nunknown interaction potential $V$ from external scattering data. Although we\nseek a local (diagonally-dominated) $V$ as the solution to the posed problem,\nwe allow $V$ to be nonlocal at the intermediate stages of iterations. This\nallows us to utilize the one-to-one correspondence between $V$ and the T-matrix\nof the problem, $T$. Here it is important to realize that not every $T$\ncorresponds to a diagonal $V$ and we, therefore, relax the usual condition of\nstrict diagonality (locality) of $V$. An iterative algorithm is proposed in\nwhich we seek $T$ that is (i) compatible with the measured scattering data and\n(ii) corresponds to an interaction potential $V$ that is as\ndiagonally-dominated as possible.

In this\narticle we focus on hole-conjugate states, nu=2/3 and nu=3/5, and present a new\npicture of their edge reconstruction. For example, while the present model for\nnu=2/3 consists of a single downstream charge channel with conductance 2/3\ne^2/h and an upstream neutral mode, we show that the current is carried by two\nseparate downstream edge channels, each with conductance 1/3 e^2/h, accompanied\nby upstream neutral mode(s). We find that if the two downstream channels are\nnot equilibrated, inter-mode equilibration (via particle exchange) takes place\nover a distance of microns, with the two channels effectively behaving as a\nsingle channel. Moreover, the inter-channel equilibration is accompanied by an\nexcitation of upstream neutral modes. In turn, the counter-propagating neutral\nmodes, moving in close proximity to the charge modes, fragment into propagating\ncharges, inducing thus downstream current fluctuations with zero net current -\na novel mechanism for non-equilibrium noise.

The latter is a linear PDE which describes the Tracy-Widom functions\ncorresponding to general values of $\\beta$. Using his Lax pair, Rumanov derives\nan explicit formula for the Tracy-Widom $\\beta=6$ function in terms of the\nsecond Painlev\\'e transcendent and the solution of an auxiliary ODE.

In this paper, the\nfirst one in a sequel, we show that Rumanov's Lax-pair can be interpreted as a\ncertain gauge transformation of the standard Lax pair for the second Painlev\\'e\nequation. This gauge transformation though contains functional parameters which\nare defined via some auxiliary nonlinear ODE which is equivalent to the\nauxiliary ODE of Rumanov's formula.

To answer\nthis question, we use cellular dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) with a\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo solver to determine the superconducting\nphase diagram as a function of temperature and doping for on-site repulsion\n$U=9t$ and nearest-neighbor repulsion $V=0,2t,4t$. In the underdoped regime,\n$V$ increases the CDMFT superconducting transition temperature $T_c^d$ even\nthough it decreases the superconducting order parameter at low temperature for\nall dopings. However, $V$ decreases $T_c^d$ in the overdoped regime. We gain\ninsight into these paradoxical results through a detailed study of the\nfrequency dependence of the anomalous spectral function, extracted at finite\ntemperature via the MaxEntAux method for analytic continuation. A systematic\nstudy of dynamical positive and negative contributions to pairing reveals that\neven though $V$ has a high-frequency depairing contribution, it also has a low\nfrequency pairing contribution since it can reinforce superexchange through\n$J=4t^2/(U-V)$. Retardation is thus crucial to understand pairing in doped Mott\ninsulators, as suggested by previous zero-temperature studies. We also comment\non the tendency to charge order for large $V$ and on the persistence of d-wave\nsuperconductivity over extended-$s$ or s+d-wave.\n","Comment: Latex, 16 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Using FORS2/VLT, we obtained\nposition measurements of the star in the plane of the sky that tightly\nconstrain its astrometric reflex motion caused by the super-Jupiter planet `b`\nin a 1052-day orbit.

The derived jet energetics and\ntimescales, along with the presence of two optical nuclei in 3C 293, all\nprovide a strong support to the Lense-Thirring precession model in which the\nsupermassive black hole spin, and therefore the jet axis, flips rapidly owing\nto the interactions with the tilted accretion disk in a new tidal interaction\nepisode of the merging process.

The global\nnature of the collapse implies that the SFR increases over time. The\nhierarchical nature of the collapse consists of small-scale collapses within\nlarger-scale ones. The large-scale collapses culminate a few Myr later than the\nsmall-scale ones and consist of filamentary flows that accrete onto massive\ncentral clumps. The small-scale collapses form clumps that are embedded in the\nfilaments and falling onto the large-scale collapse centers. The stars formed\nin the early, small-scale collapses share the infall motion of their parent\nclumps. Thus, the filaments feed both gaseous and stellar material to the\nmassive central clump. This leads to the presence of a few older stars in a\nregion where new protostars are forming, and also to a self-similar structure,\nin which each unit is composed of smaller-scale sub-units that approach each\nother and may merge. Because the older stars formed in the filaments share the\ninfall motion of the gas onto the central clump, they tend to have larger\nvelocities and to be distributed over larger areas than the younger stars\nformed in the central clump. Finally, interpreting the IMF at face-value as a\nprobability distribution implies that massive stars only form once the {\\it\nlocal} SFR is large enough to sample the IMF up to high masses. In combination\nwith the increase of the SFR, this implies that massive stars tend to appear\nlate in the evolution of the MC, and only in the central massive clumps. We\ndiscuss the correspondence of these features with observed properties of young\nstellar clusters, finding very good qualitative agreement, thus providing\nsupport to the scenario of global, hierarchical collapse of MCs, while\nexplaining the origin of the observed cluster structure.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures.

Although both algorithms converge quickly,\nthey may not converge to a stationary point to the problem that is equal to the\nsolution to a nonmonotone variational inequality for the gradient of the\ndistance function. This paper presents an iterative algorithm for solving the\nproblem that is based on the Krasnosel'ski\\u\\i-Mann fixed point algorithm.\nConvergence analysis showed that, under certain assumptions, any accumulation\npoint of the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm belongs to the\nsolution set of the variational inequality. Application of the {\\tt 'mult'} and\n{\\tt'als'} algorithms in MATLAB and the proposed algorithm to various NMF\nproblems showed that the proposed algorithm had fast convergence and was\neffective.\n"]}]

In contrast\nto traditional cable television, revenue in online services is generated solely\nthrough advertisements, and depends on the number of clicks generated.

A remarkable early\nfinding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on\nreaction times; i.e., the influence or reaction time of the time period between\na warning signal and an imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to\nrespond as quickly as possible. Recently it has been shown that the phase of\noscillatory activity preceding stimulus presentation is related to behavior.\nHere we connect both of these findings by reporting a novel foreperiod effect\non the inter-trial phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) triggered\nby stimuli to which subjects are instructed not to respond. Inter-trial phase\ncoherence has been used to describe regularities in phases of groups of trials\ntime locked to an event of interest. We propose a single-trial measure of\ninter-trial phase coherence and prove its soundness. Equipped with this\nmeasure, and using a multivariate decoding method, we demonstrate that the\nforeperiod duration in and audiovisual attention-shifting task modulates\nsingle-trial phase coherence. In principle, this modulation could be an\nartifact of the decoding method used to detect it. We show that this is not the\ncase, since the modulation can also be observed using a simple averaging\nmethod. We show that the strength of this modulation correlates with subject\nbehavior (both error rates and mean-reaction times). We anticipate that the new\nforeperiod effect on inter-trial phase coherence, and the decoding method used\nhere to detect it, will be important tools to understand cognition at the\nsingle-trial level.

Most of these problems boil\ndown to the problem of minimizing an average of a finite set of smooth and\nstrongly convex functions where the number of functions $n$ is large. Gradient\ndescent method (GD) is successful in minimizing convex problems at a fast\nlinear rate; however, it is not applicable to the considered large-scale\noptimization setting because of the high computational complexity. Incremental\nmethods resolve this drawback of gradient methods by replacing the required\ngradient for the descent direction with an incremental gradient approximation.\nThey operate by evaluating one gradient per iteration and executing the average\nof the $n$ available gradients as a gradient approximate. Although, incremental\nmethods reduce the computational cost of GD, their convergence rates do not\njustify their advantage relative to GD in terms of the total number of gradient\nevaluations until convergence. In this paper, we introduce a Double Incremental\nAggregated Gradient method (DIAG) that computes the gradient of only one\nfunction at each iteration, which is chosen based on a cyclic scheme, and uses\nthe aggregated average gradient of all the functions to approximate the full\ngradient. The iterates of the proposed DIAG method uses averages of both\niterates and gradients in oppose to classic incremental methods that utilize\ngradient averages but do not utilize iterate averages. We prove that not only\nthe proposed DIAG method converges linearly to the optimal solution, but also\nits linear convergence factor justifies the advantage of incremental methods on\nGD. In particular, we prove that the worst case performance of DIAG is better\nthan the worst case performance of GD.\n"]}]
