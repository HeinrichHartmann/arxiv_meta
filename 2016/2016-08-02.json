In the first method, a numerically simulated lens\nphase distribution is loaded directly onto the SLM, together with the cubic\nphase distribution. An Airy beam is generated at the focal plane of the\nnumerical lens. We provide for the first time a quantitative properties of the\nformed Airy beam. We derive the formula for deflection of the intensity maximum\nof the so formed Airy beam, which is different to the quadratic deflection\ntypical of Airy beams. We cross-validate the derived formula by both\nsimulations and experiment. The second method is based on the fact that a\nsystem consisting of a transmissive SLM sandwiched between two polarisers can\ncreate a transmission function with negative values. This observation alone has\nthe potential for various other wavefront modulations where the transmission\nfunction requires negative values. As an example for this method, we\ndemonstrate that a wavefront can be modulated by passing the SLM system with\ntransmission function with negative values by loading an Airy function\ndistribution directly onto SLM. Since the Airy function is a real-valued\nfunction but also with negative values, an Airy beam can be generated by direct\ntransfer of the Airy function distribution onto such an SLM system. In this\nway, an Airy beam is generated immediately behind the SLM.

Geometry\nand motion are parameterized in a unified manner by a volumetric representation\nthat encodes a distance field of the surface geometry as well as the non-rigid\nspace deformation. Motion tracking is based on a set of extracted sparse color\nfeatures in combination with a dense depth-based constraint formulation. This\nenables accurate tracking and drastically reduces drift inherent to standard\nmodel-to-depth alignment. We cast finding the optimal deformation of space as a\nnon-linear regularized variational optimization problem by enforcing local\nsmoothness and proximity to the input constraints. The problem is tackled in\nreal-time at the camera's capture rate using a data-parallel flip-flop\noptimization strategy. Our results demonstrate robust tracking even for fast\nmotion and scenes that lack geometric features.\n"]}]

Describing the system within a tight-binding formalism we\npresent an analytical method to unravel the analogy between a one-dimensional\nmagnetic chain and a multi-strand ladder network. This analogy is crucial, and\nis subsequently exploited to engineer gaps in the energy spectrum by an\nappropriate choice of the magnetic substrate. We obtain an exact correlation\nbetween the magnitude of the spin of the incoming beam of particles and the\nmagnetic moment of the substrate atoms in the chain desired for opening up of a\nspectral gap. Results of spin polarized transport, calculated within a transfer\nmatrix formalism, are presented for particles having half-integer as well as\nhigher spin states. We find that the chain can be made to act as a quantum\ndevice which opens a transmission window only for selected spin components over\ncertain ranges of the Fermi energy, blocking them in the remaining part of the\nspectrum. The results appear to be robust even when the choice of the substrate\natoms deviates substantially from the ideal situation, as verified by extending\nthe ideas to the case of a spin spiral. Interestingly, the spin spiral\ngeometry, apart from exhibiting the filtering effect, is also seen to act as a\ndevice flipping spins - an effect that can be monitored by an interplay of the\nsystem size and the period of the spiral. Our scheme is applicable to ultracold\nquantum gases, and might inspire future experiments in this direction.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, Supplemental files are added as ancillary files\n  in a folder called \"anc\", Revised version is uploaded"]}]

For the study of\nthe oriented attachment phenomenon, the microscopy and nanoscience community\nhave used dynamic electron microscopy for direct observations of nanoparticle\naggregation and have been so far relying on manual and qualitative analysis of\nthe observations. In this paper, we present a statistical approach for studying\nthe oriented attachment phenomenon with multiple aggregation examples observed\nby dynamic microscope data. We abstract a nanoparticle aggregation by an event\nof two primary geometric objects merging into a secondary geometric object. We\nuse a point set representation to describe the geometric features of the\nprimary objects and the secondary object, and formulated the Procrustes\nalignment of two point sets to one point set to estimate the orientation angles\nof the primary objects within the secondary object. We fit a mixture of\nconcentrated sine distributions to the estimated orientation angles for the\ndensity estimation. By analyzing the density estimate, we are able to\ndemonstrate that nanoparticles of certain geometries have indeed preferential\norientations in their aggregates.\n"]}]

(Or, Unscrambling Ontological\n  Problems from Epistemological Solutions in QM)"],"description":["  In this paper we discuss the so called \"quantum omelette\" created by Bohr and\nHeisenberg through the mix of (ontic) objective accounts and (epistemic)\nsubjective ones within the analysis of Quantum Mechanics (QM). We will begin by\naddressing the difficult relation between ontology and epistemology within the\nhistory of both physics and philosophy. We will then argue that the present\n\"quantum omelette\" is being presently cooked in two opposite directions: the\nfirst scrambling ontological problems with epistemological solutions and the\nsecond scrambling epistemic approaches with ontological questions. A good\nexample of the former is a new type of argumentation strategy attempting to\njustify the use of decoherence, namely, the \"For All Practical Purposes\"\n(shortly known as FAPP) type of justification. We will argue that 'FAPP-type\nsolutions' remain, at best, epistemological answers which not only escape the\nontological questions at stake -regarding the quantum to classical limit- but\nalso turn the original problem completely meaningless. The latter omelette can\nbe witnessed in relation to some criticisms raised against the epistemic\nBayesian approach to QM (shortly known as QBism). We will argue that QBists\nhave produced a consistent scheme that might allow us to begin to unscramble\n-at least part of- the \"quantum omelette\". In this respect, we will show why\nthe epistemic QBist approach is safe from several (ontological) criticisms it\nhas recently received (see [42, 47, 48]). We end our paper with a discussion\nabout the importance of ontological approaches within foundations of QM.\n","Comment: Welcome!"]}]

We\npresent a series of observations, five epochs over a year, taken with Keck and\nthe VLT, which for the first time show variability of circumstellar absorption\nin the gas disk surrounding WD 1145+017 on timescales of minutes to months.\nCircumstellar absorption is measured in more than 250 lines of 14 ions among\nten different elements associated with planetary composition, e.g., O, Mg, Ca,\nTi, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni. Broad circumstellar gas absorption with a velocity spread\nof 225 km/s is detected, but over the course of a year blue shifted absorption\ndisappears while redshifted absorption systematically increases. A correlation\nof equivalent width and oscillator strength indicates that the gas is not\nhighly optically thick (median tau approximately 2). We discuss simple models\nof an eccentric disk coupled with magnetospheric accretion to explain the basic\nobserved characteristics of these high resolution and high signal-to-noise\nobservations. Variability is detected on timescales of minutes in the two most\nrecent observations, showing a loss of redshifted absorption for tens of\nminutes, coincident with major transit events and consistent with gas hidden\nbehind opaque transiting material. This system currently presents a unique\nopportunity to learn how the gas causing the spectroscopic, circumstellar\nabsorption is associated with the ongoing accretion evidenced by photospheric\ncontamination, as well as the transiting planetary material detected in\nphotometric observations.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

Interestingly, when the\ndata follow the $t$-distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom, GMM typically\nprovides a better measure of similarity than \"cosine\" roughly when $\\nu<8$\n(which is already very close to normal).
