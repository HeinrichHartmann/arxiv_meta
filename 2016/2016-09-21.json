Kontsevich and A. Rosenberg [KR] proposed a heuristic\nprinciple according to which the family of schemes ${Rep_n(A)}$ parametrizing\nthe finite-dimensional represen- tations of a noncommutative algebra A should\nbe thought of as a substitute or \"approximation\" for Spec(A). The idea is that\nevery property or noncommutative geometric structure on A should induce a\ncorresponding geometric property or structure on $Rep_n(A)$ for all n. In\nrecent years, many interesting structures in noncommutative geometry have\noriginated from this idea. In practice, however, if an associative algebra A\npossesses a property of geometric nature (e.g., A is a NC complete\nintersection, Cohen-Macaulay, Calabi-Yau, etc.), it often happens that, for\nsome n, the scheme $Rep_n(A)$ fails to have the corresponding property in the\nusual algebro-geometric sense. The reason for this seems to be that the\nrepresentation functor $Rep_n$ is not \"exact\" and should be replaced by its\nderived functor $DRep_n$ (in the sense of non-abelian homological algebra). The\nhigher homology of $DRep_n(A)$, which we call representation homology,\nobstructs $Rep_n(A)$ from having the desired property and thus measures the\nfailure of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg \"approximation.\" In this paper, which is\nmostly a survey, we prove several results confirming this intuition.

The numerical reversals are characterized by a switch\nfrom a high axial dipole moment state to a low axial dipole moment state. When\nanalysing the respective transitions we find that decay and growth have very\nsimilar time scales and that there is no overshoot. Other properties are\ngenerally similar to paleomagnetic findings. The dipole moment has to decrease\nto about 30% of its mean to allow for reversals. Grand excursions during which\nthe field intensity drops by a comparable margin are very similar to reversals\nand likely have the same internal origin.

The structure of the paper is similar to that presented in\nthe 2013 Planck release; the main differences concern the beam normalization\nand the delivery of the window functions to be used for polarization analysis.\nThe in-flight assessment of the LFI main beams relies on measurements performed\nduring observations of Jupiter. By stacking data from seven Jupiter transits,\nthe main beam profiles are measured down to -25 dB at 30 and 44 GHz, and down\nto -30 dB at 70 GHz. It has been confirmed that the agreement between the\nsimulated beams and the measured beams is better than 1% at each LFI frequency\nband (within the 20 dB contour from the peak, the rms values are 0.1% at 30 and\n70 GHz; 0.2% at 44 GHz). Simulated polarized beams are used for the computation\nof the effective beam window functions. The error budget for the window\nfunctions is estimated from both main beam and sidelobe contributions, and\naccounts for the radiometer band shapes. The total uncertainties in the\neffective beam window functions are 0.7% and 1% at 30 and 44 GHz, respectively\n(at $\\ell \\approx 600$); and 0.5% at 70 GHz (at $\\ell \\approx 1000$).\n","Comment: 22 pages, 24 figures"]}]

High Frequency Instrument data processing:\n  Calibration and maps"],"description":["  This paper describes the processing applied to the Planck High Frequency\nInstrument (HFI) cleaned, time-ordered information to produce photometrically\ncalibrated maps in temperature and (for the first time) in polarization. The\ndata from the entire 2.5 year HFI mission include almost five independent\nfull-sky surveys. HFI observes the sky over a broad range of frequencies, from\n100 to 857 GHz. To obtain the best accuracy on the calibration over such a\nlarge range, two different photometric calibration schemes have been used. The\n545 and 857 GHz data are calibrated using models of planetary atmospheric\nemission. The lower frequencies (from 100 to 353 GHz) are calibrated using the\ntime-variable cosmological microwave background dipole, which we call the\n\"orbital dipole\". This source of calibration only depends on the satellite\nvelocity with respect to the solar system. Using a CMB temperature of 2.7255\n+/- 0.0006 K, it permits an independent measurement of the amplitude of the CMB\nsolar dipole (3364.3 +/- 1.5 \\mu K) which is approximatively 1\\sigma\\ higher\nthan the WMAP measurement with a direction that is consistent between both\nexperiments. We describe the pipeline used to produce the maps of intensity and\nlinear polarization from the HFI timelines, and the scheme used to set the zero\nlevel of the maps a posteriori. We also summarize the noise characteristics of\nthe HFI maps in the 2015 Planck data release and present some null tests to\nassess their quality. Finally, we discuss the major systematic effects and in\nparticular the leakage induced by flux mismatch between the detectors that\nleads to spurious polarization signal.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 19 figures, one of the papers associated with the 2015\n  Planck data release"]}]

We present the first searches using\nCMB polarization for correlations induced by a non-trivial topology with a\nfundamental domain intersecting, or nearly intersecting, the last scattering\nsurface (at comoving distance $\\chi_{rec}$). We specialize to flat spaces with\ntoroidal and slab topologies, finding that explicit searches for the latter are\nsensitive to other topologies with antipodal symmetry. These searches yield no\ndetection of a compact topology at a scale below the diameter of the last\nscattering surface. The limits on the radius $R_i$ of the largest sphere\ninscribed in the topological domain (at log-likelihood-ratio $\\Delta\\ln{L}>-5$\nrelative to a simply-connected flat Planck best-fit model) are\n$R_i>0.97\\chi_{rec}$ for the cubic torus and $R_i>0.56\\chi_{rec}$ for the slab.\nThe limit for the cubic torus from the matched-circles search is numerically\nequivalent, $R_i>0.97\\chi_{rec}$ (99% CL) from polarisation data alone.

Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected\nvia their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise of six, and\nis more than a factor of two larger than the 2013 Planck cluster cosmology\nsample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible\nconstraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the\nlarger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in\nredshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of\ngravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide\npriors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, $1-b$. In addition, we use lensing of\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck clusters\nas a third independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations\nimply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in\nvarying degrees of tension with those coming from Planck analysis of primary\nfluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of $1-b$ the tension\nis mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while for the largest\nestimated value it remains substantial. We also examine constraints on\nextensions to the base flat $\\Lambda CDM$ model by combining the cluster and\nCMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses,\nbut this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it\nsimultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby\nexacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates.\nImproving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10%-level\nto 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a\nstringent test of the base $\\Lambda CDM$ model.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 17 figures"]}]

The focus is put\nhere on stability with respect to perturbations of the same period as the wave,\nfor KdV-like systems of one-dimensional Hamiltonian PDEs. Stability criteria\nare derived and investigated first in a general abstract framework, and then\napplied to three basic examples that are very closely related, and ubiquitous\nin mathematical physics, namely, a quasilinear version of the generalized\nKorteweg--de Vries equation (qKdV), and the Euler--Korteweg system in both\nEulerian coordinates (EKE) and in mass Lagrangian coordinates (EKL).

Regarding solitary waves, the celebrated\nGrillakis--Shatah--Strauss stability criteria amount to looking for the sign of\nthe second derivative of the moment of instability with respect to the wave\nspeed. For periodic waves, the most striking results obtained here can be\nsummarized as: an odd value for the difference between N -- the size of the PDE\nsystem -- and the negative signature of the Hessian of the action implies\nspectral instability, whereas a negative signature of the same Hessian being\nequal to N implies orbital stability. Since these stability criteria are merely\nencoded by the negative signature of matrices, they can at least be checked\nnumerically.

Diffuse low-frequency Galactic foregrounds"],"description":["  (abridged) We discuss the Galactic foreground emission between 20 and 100GHz\nbased on observations by Planck/WMAP. The Commander component-separation tool\nhas been used to separate the various astrophysical processes in total\nintensity. Comparison with RRL templates verifies the recovery of the free-free\nemission along the Galactic plane. Comparison of the high-latitude Halpha\nemission with our free-free map shows residuals that correlate with dust\noptical depth, consistent with a fraction (~30%) of Halpha having been\nscattered by high-latitude dust. We highlight a number of diffuse spinning dust\nmorphological features at high latitude. There is substantial spatial variation\nin the spinning dust spectrum, with the emission peak ranging from below 20GHz\nto more than 50GHz. There is a strong tendency for the spinning dust component\nnear many prominent HII regions to have a higher peak frequency, suggesting\nthat this increase in peak frequency is associated with dust in the\nphotodissociation regions around the nebulae. The emissivity of spinning dust\nin these diffuse regions is of the same order as previous detections in the\nliterature. Over the entire sky, the commander solution finds more anomalous\nmicrowave emission than the WMAP component maps, at the expense of synchrotron\nand free-free emission. This can be explained by the difficulty in separating\nmultiple broadband components with a limited number of frequency maps. Future\nsurveys (5-20GHz), will greatly improve the separation by constraining the\nsynchrotron spectrum. We combine Planck/WMAP data to make the highest S/N ratio\nmaps yet of the intensity of the all-sky polarized synchrotron emission at\nfrequencies above a few GHz. Most of the high-latitude polarized emission is\nassociated with distinct large-scale loops and spurs, and we re-discuss their\nstructure...\n","Comment: Planck collaboration paper XXV from 2015 results.

The main improvements are the use of\nmore and better processed data and of Planck polarization data, and more\ndetailed foreground and instrumental models, allowing further checks and\nenhanced immunity to systematics. Progress in foreground modelling enables a\nlarger sky fraction. Improvements in processing and instrumental models further\nreduce uncertainties. For temperature, we perform an analysis of end-to-end\ninstrumental simulations fed into the data processing pipeline; this does not\nreveal biases from residual instrumental systematics. The $\\Lambda$CDM\ncosmological model continues to offer a very good fit to Planck data. The slope\nof primordial scalar fluctuations, $n_s$, is confirmed smaller than unity at\nmore than 5{\\sigma} from Planck alone. We further validate robustness against\nspecific extensions to the baseline cosmology. E.g., the effective number of\nneutrino species remains compatible with the canonical value of 3.046. This\nfirst detailed analysis of Planck polarization concentrates on E modes. At low\n$\\ell$ we use temperature at all frequencies and a subset of polarization. The\nfrequency range improves CMB-foreground separation. Within the baseline model\nthis requires a reionization optical depth $\\tau=0.078\\pm0.019$, significantly\nlower than without high-frequency data for explicit dust monitoring.

This\nproject aims to capture correctly the thermal history of the intergalactic\nmedium (IGM) as a result of reionization and make predictions about the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest and baryon temperature-density relation. The dominant\nsources of radiation for this transition are quasars, so modeling the source\npopulation accurately is very important for making reliable predictions. In\nthis first paper, we present a new method for populating dark matter halos with\nquasars. Our set of quasar models include two different light curves, a\nlightbulb (simple on/off) and symmetric exponential model, and\nluminosity-dependent quasar lifetimes. Our method self-consistently reproduces\nan input quasar luminosity function (QLF) given a halo catalog from an $N$-body\nsimulation, and propagates quasars through the merger history of halo hosts.\nAfter calibrating quasar clustering using measurements from BOSS, we find that\nthe characteristic mass of quasar hosts is $M_h \\sim 2.5 \\times 10^{12}\nM_\\odot$ $h^{-1}$ for the lightbulb model, and $M_h \\sim 2.3 \\times 10^{12}\nM_\\odot$ $h^{-1}$ for the exponential model. In the exponential model, the peak\nquasar luminosity for a given halo mass is larger than that in the lightbulb\nmodel, typically by a factor of 1.5-2. The effective lifetime for quasars in\nthe lightbulb model is 59 Myr, and in the exponential case, the effective time\nconstant is about 15 Myr. We include semi-analytic calculations of helium\nreionization, and discuss how to include these quasars as sources of ionizing\nradiation for full hydrodynamics with radiative transfer simulations in order\nto study helium reionization.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 12 figures.

Recently, iPTF13ehe challenges these\nenergy-source models, because the spectral analysis shows that $\\sim\n2.5M_\\odot$ of $^{56}$Ni have been synthesized but are inadequate to power the\npeak bolometric emission of iPTF13ehe, while the rebrightening of the late-time\nlight-curve (LC) and the H$\\alpha$ emission lines indicate that the ejecta-CSM\ninteraction must play a key role in powering the late-time LC. Here we propose\na triple-energy-source model, in which a magnetar together with some amount\n($\\lesssim 2.5M_\\odot$) of $^{56}$Ni may power the early LC of iPTF13ehe while\nthe late-time rebrightening can be quantitatively explained by an ejecta-CSM\ninteraction.

These equations provide an optimum\nrepresentation of the kinematic properties of systems of curved and connected\ndislocation lines with the information contained in a given set of density\nmeasures. The performance of the derived equations is benchmarked against other\nmodels proposed in the literature, using discrete dislocation dynamics\nsimulations as a reference. As a benchmark problem we study dislocations moving\nin a highly heterogeneous, persistent slip-band-like geometry. We demonstrate\nthat excellent agreement with discrete simulations can be obtained in terms of\na very small number of averaged dislocation fields containing information about\nthe edge and screw components of the total and excess (geometrically necessary)\ndislocation densities. From these the full dislocation orientation distribution\nwhich emerges as dislocations move through a channel-wall structure can be\nfaithfully reconstructed.\n"]}]

We first perform a stacking\nanalysis towards Planck-confirmed galaxy clusters. We detect infrared emission\nproduced by dusty galaxies inside these clusters and demonstrate that the\ninfrared emission is about 50% more extended than the tSZ effect. Modelling the\nemission with a Navarro--Frenk--White profile, we find that the radial profile\nconcentration parameter is $c_{500} = 1.00^{+0.18}_{-0.15}$. This indicates\nthat infrared galaxies in the outskirts of clusters have higher infrared flux\nthan cluster-core galaxies. We also study the cross-correlation between tSZ and\nCIB anisotropies, following three alternative approaches based on power\nspectrum analyses: (i) using a catalogue of confirmed clusters detected in\nPlanck data; (ii) using an all-sky tSZ map built from Planck frequency maps;\nand (iii) using cross-spectra between Planck frequency maps. With the three\ndifferent methods, we detect the tSZ-CIB cross-power spectrum at significance\nlevels of (i) 6 $\\sigma$, (ii) 3 $\\sigma$, and (iii) 4 $\\sigma$. We model the\ntSZ-CIB cross-correlation signature and compare predictions with the\nmeasurements. The amplitude of the cross-correlation relative to the fiducial\nmodel is $A_{\\rm tSZ-CIB}= 1.2\\pm0.3$.

Remarkably, engineered dissipation enables the\npreparation of quantum states of atoms, ions or superconducting qubits as well\nas their stabilization. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a\ndissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the\nfield of cavity electro- and optomechanics, the control over mechanical\noscillators utilizes the inherently cold, dissipative nature of the\nelectromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent\ntheoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of\nthe mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold, dissipative reservoir\nto an electromagnetic mode. Here we realize this reversed dissipation regime in\na microwave cavity optomechanical system and realize a quasi-instantaneous,\ncold reservoir for microwave light. Coupling to this reservoir enables to\nmanipulate the susceptibility of the microwave cavity, corresponding to\ndynamical backaction control of the microwave field. Additionally, we observe\nthe onset of parametric instability, i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves\n(masing). Equally important, the reservoir can function as a useful quantum\nresource. We evidence this by employing the engineered cold reservoir to\nimplement a large gain (above 40 dB) phase preserving microwave amplifier that\noperates 0.87 quanta above the limit of added noise imposed by quantum\nmechanics.

Their ability to reproduce the streak deflectometry\nmeasurements was tested on the basis of three-dimensional particle simulations.\nA modification and combination of the two models allowed for an extensive and\naccurate reproduction of the experimental results in both imaging\nconfigurations. The controlled change of the laser pulse duration from 50\nfemtoseconds to 2.7 picoseconds led to a transition of the dominating force\nacting on the probing proton beam at the rear side of the polymer foil.

However,\nit has been challenging to use the survey results to connect this evolution to\nthe cosmological environment that AGNs inhabit. Exploring this connection will\nbe crucial to understanding the triggering mechanisms of AGNs and how these\nprocesses manifest in observations at all wavelengths. In anticipation of\nupcoming wide-field X-ray surveys that will allow quantitative analysis of AGN\nenvironments, this paper presents a method to observationally constrain the\nConditional Luminosity Function (CLF) of AGNs at a specific $z$. Once measured,\nthe CLF allows the calculation of the AGN bias, mean dark matter halo mass, AGN\nlifetime, halo occupation number, and AGN correlation function -- all as a\nfunction of luminosity. The CLF can be constrained using a measurement of the\nX-ray luminosity function and the correlation length at different luminosities.\nThe method is illustrated at $z \\approx 0$ and $0.9$ using the limited data\nthat is currently available, and a clear luminosity dependence in the AGN bias\nand mean halo mass is predicted at both $z$, supporting the idea that there are\nat least two different modes of AGN triggering. In addition, the CLF predicts\nthat $z\\approx 0.9$ quasars may be commonly hosted by haloes with\n$M_{\\mathrm{h}} \\sim 10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$.

In this work, a method to compute the\nConditional Luminosity Function (CLF) of Type 2 and Type 1 AGNs is presented.\nThe CLF allows many fundamental halo properties to be computed as a function of\nAGN luminosity, which we apply to the question of the host halo masses of Type\n1 and 2 AGNs. By making use of the total AGN CLF, the Type 1 X-ray luminosity\nfunction, and the luminosity-dependent Type 2 AGN fraction, the CLFs of Type 1\nand 2 AGNs are calculated at $z\\approx 0$ and $0.9$. At both $z$, there is no\nstatistically significant difference in the mean halo mass of Type 2 and 1 AGNs\nat any luminosity.

As the Type 1 lifetime is longer, the host halo will\nincrease somewhat in mass during the Type 1 phase.

In addition, several\nmagnetohydrodynamics tests are performed which demonstrate the accuracy and\nstability of the new constrained transport approach, including two tests of the\nmagneto-rotational instability (MRI); one testing the linear growth rate and\nthe other following the instability into the fully turbulent regime.\n","Comment: Accepted to ApJS"]}]

Observations of flux emergence indicate that rotational velocities\nmay develop within sunspots.

We investigate the effects of varying the initial field strength and\ntwist of an emerging sub-photospheric magnetic flux tube on the rotation of the\nsunspots at the photosphere.\n  Methods. We consider a simple model of a stratified domain with a\nsub-photospheric interior layer and three overlying atmospheric layers. A\ntwisted arched flux tube is inserted in the interior and is allowed to rise\ninto the atmosphere. To achieve this, the MHD equations are solved using the\nLagrangian-remap code, Lare3d. We perform a parameter study by independently\nvarying the sub-photospheric magnetic field strength and twist.\n  Results. Altering the initial field strength and twist significantly affects\nthe tube's evolution and the rotational motions that develop at the\nphotosphere. The rotation angle, vorticity, and current show a direct\ndependence on the initial field strength. We find that an increase in field\nstrength increases the angle through which the fieldlines rotate, the length of\nfieldlines extending into the atmosphere, and the magnetic energy transported\nto the atmosphere. This also affects the amount of residual twist in the\ninterior. The length of the fieldlines is crucial as we predict the twist per\nunit length equilibrates to a lower value on longer fieldlines. No such direct\ndependence is found when we modify the twist owing to the complex effect this\nhas on the tension force acting on the tube. However, there is still a clear\nordering in quantities such as the rotation angle, helicity, and free energy\nwith higher initial twist cases being related to sunspots that rotate more\nrapidly, transporting more helicity and magnetic energy to the atmosphere.\n"]}]

We demonstrate that the UV composite\nspectra of z~3 galaxies can be modeled well by assuming our new attenuation\ncurve, a high covering fraction of HI, and absorption from the Lyman-Werner\nbands of H2 with a small (<20%) covering fraction. The low covering fraction of\nH2 relative to that of the HI and dust suggests that most of the dust in the\nISM of typical galaxies at z~3 is unrelated to the catalysis of H2, and is\nassociated with other phases of the ISM (i.e., the ionized and neutral gas).\nThe far-UV dust curve implies a factor of ~2 lower dust attenuation of Lyman\ncontinuum (ionizing) photons relative to those inferred from the most commonly\nassumed attenuation curves for L* galaxies at z~3.

We\nfind that the proximity force approximation (PFA) significantly overestimates\nthe Casimir energy, both in the case of the ordinary PFA, which applies when\nthe disk is parallel to the plane, and the \"edge PFA,\" which applies when the\ndisk is perpendicular to the plane.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 .eps figures; v2: minor clarifications, expanded\n  discussion in Sec. 4, version accepted for publication in PRA"]}]

Followup simulations performed using\npreviously-estimated binary parameters most resemble the data. Comparisons\nincluding only the quadrupolar modes constrain the total redshifted mass Mz \\in\n[64 - 82M_\\odot], mass ratio q = m2/m1 \\in [0.6,1], and effective aligned spin\n\\chi_eff \\in [-0.3, 0.2], where \\chi_{eff} = (S1/m1 + S2/m2) \\cdot\\hat{L} /M.\nIncluding both quadrupolar and octopolar modes, we find the mass ratio is even\nmore tightly constrained. Simulations with extreme mass ratios and effective\nspins are highly inconsistent with the data, at any mass. Several nonprecessing\nand precessing simulations with similar mass ratio and \\chi_{eff} are\nconsistent with the data. Though correlated, the components' spins (both in\nmagnitude and directions) are not significantly constrained by the data. For\nnonprecessing binaries, interpolating between simulations, we reconstruct a\nposterior distribution consistent with previous results. The final black hole's\nredshifted mass is consistent with Mf,z between 64.0 - 73.5M_\\odot and the\nfinal black hole's dimensionless spin parameter is consistent with af = 0.62 -\n0.73.

(2016). Previous follow-up has revealed Lyman-alpha in\ntwo of the four galaxies. Our new MOSFIRE observations confirm that Lyman-alpha\nis present in the entire sample. We detect Lyman-alpha emission in COS-zs7-1,\nconfirming its redshift as z=7.154, and we detect Lyman-alpha in EGS-zs8-2 at\nz=7.477, verifying a tentative detection presented in an earlier study. The\nubiquity of Lyman-alpha in this sample is puzzling given that the IGM is likely\nsignificantly neutral over 7<z<9. To investigate this result in more detail, we\nhave initiated a campaign to target UV metal emission in the four Lyman-alpha\nemitters as a probe of both the radiation field and the velocity offset of\nLyman-alpha. Here we present the detection of intense CIII] emission in\nEGS-zs8-1, a galaxy from this sample previously shown to have Lyman-alpha at\nz=7.73. Photoionization models indicate that an intense radiation field and low\nmetallicity are required to reproduce the intense CIII] and optical line\nemission. We argue that this extreme radiation field is likely to affect the\nlocal environment, increasing the transmission of Lyman-alpha through the\ngalaxy. Moreover, the centroid of CIII] indicates that Lyman-alpha is\nredshifted from the systemic value by 340 km/s. This velocity offset is larger\nthan that seen in less luminous systems, providing an additional explanation\nfor the transmission of Lyman-alpha emission through the IGM. Since the\ntransmission is further enhanced by the likelihood that such systems are also\nsituated in the densest regions with the largest ionized bubbles, the\nvisibility of Lyman-alpha at z>7 is expected to be strongly\nluminosity-dependent, with the most effective transmission occurring in systems\nwith intense star formation.\n","Comment: Submitted to MNRAS, 13 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In\nthis letter we scrutinise, with high resolution 3D spectral simulations, the\nonset and survival of this instability in the presence of viscous and thermal\nphysics. First, we find that the ZVI is strongly dependent on the nature of the\nviscous operator. Although the ZVI is easily obtained with hyper-diffusion, it\nis difficult to sustain with physical (second order) diffusion operators up to\nReynolds numbers as high as 10^7. This sensitivity is probably due to the ZVI's\nreliance on critical layers, whose characteristic lengthscale, structure, and\ndynamics are controlled by viscous diffusion. Second, we observe that the ZVI\nis sensitive to radiative processes, and indeed only operates when the Peclet\nnumber is greater than a critical value ~10^4, or when the cooling time is\nlonger than ~10 Omega^{-1}. As a consequence, the ZVI struggles to appear at\nR>0.3 AU in standard 0.01 M_sun T Tauri disc models, though younger more\nmassive disks provide a more hospitable environment.

The magnetic field\nlines in the outer acceleration region (OAR) are connected to the neutron star\nsurface (NSS). If copious electron--positron pairs are produced near the NSS,\nsuch pairs flow into the OAR and screen the electric field there. To activate\nthe OAR, the electromagnetic cascade due to the electric field near the NSS\nshould be suppressed. However, since a return current is expected along the\nfield lines through the OAR, the outflow extracted from the NSS alone cannot\nscreen the electric field just above the NSS. In this paper, we analytically\nand numerically study the electric-field screening at the NSS taking into\naccount the effects of the back-flowing particles from the OAR. In certain\nlimited cases, the electric field is screened without significant pair cascade\nif only ultrarelativistic particles ($\\gamma\\gg1$) flow back to the NSS. On the\nother hand, if electron--positron pairs with a significant number density and\nmildly relativistic temperature, expected to distribute in a wide region of the\nmagnetosphere, flow back to the NSS, these particles adjust the current and\ncharge densities, so that the electric field can be screened without pair\ncascade. We obtain the condition for the number density of particles to screen\nthe electric field at the NSS.

However, the mass sheet degeneracy and the need for a large number of\nbackground galaxies motivate the search for alternative tracers which can break\nthe degeneracy among model parameters and hence improve the accuracy of the\nmass estimate. Lensing flexion, i.e. the third derivative of the lensing\npotential, has been suggested as a good answer to the above quest since it\nprobes the details of the mass profile. We investigate here whether this is\nindeed the case considering jointly using weak lensing, magnification and\nflexion. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to forecast the relative improvement\nin the mass accuracy for different assumptions on the shear and flexion signal\n- to - noise (S/N) ratio also varying the cluster mass, redshift, and\nellipticity. It turns out that the error on the cluster mass may be reduced up\nto a factor 2 for reasonable values of the flexion S/N ratio. As a general\nresult, we get that the improvement in mass accuracy is larger for more\nflattened haloes, but extracting general trends is a difficult because of the\nmany parameters at play.

Electrostatic interactions are\ntypically modeled using Ewald based methods, which have become one of the\ncornerstones upon which many other methods for the numerical computation of\nelectrostatic interactions are based. However, their use with charge\ndistributions rather than point charges requires the inclusion of ansatz for\nthe solutions of the Poisson equation, since there is no exact solution known\nfor smeared out charges. The interest for incorporating electrostatic\ninteractions at the scales of length and time that are relevant for the study\nthe physics of soft condensed matter has increased considerably.

We\nemploy an implicit interpolation model to pose the learning problem in the\ncontinuous spatial domain. Our proposed formulation enables efficient\nintegration of multi-resolution deep feature maps, leading to superior results\non three object tracking benchmarks: OTB-2015 (+5.1% in mean OP), Temple-Color\n(+4.6% in mean OP), and VOT2015 (20% relative reduction in failure rate).\nAdditionally, our approach is capable of sub-pixel localization, crucial for\nthe task of accurate feature point tracking. We also demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our learning formulation in extensive feature point tracking\nexperiments.

Nuclei with larger $Z$ are usually\nproduced by $\\beta^-$-decay, but under certain conditions also $\\alpha$-induced\nreactions may become relevant for the production of nuclei with $Z+2$.\n  Purpose: The uncertainties of the reaction rates of these $\\alpha$-induced\nreactions are discussed within the statistical model.

Next the uncertainties are determined from a variation\nof the $\\alpha$-nucleus potential which is the all-dominant parameter for the\nastrophysical $Z \\rightarrow Z+2$ reaction rate.\n  Results: It is found that the $r$-process flow towards nuclei with larger $Z$\nis essentially influenced only by the $\\alpha$-nucleus potential whereas the\nother ingredients of the statistical model play a very minor role.

A naive\napplication of a Meurer-like dust correction based on the UV slope would\ndramatically over-estimate the total star formation rate, and our results\nsupport growing evidence that when integrated over the galaxy, the typical\nconditions in high-z star-forming galaxies are not analogous to those in the\nlocal starburst nuclei used to establish the Meurer relation.\n","Comment: Accepted in The Astrophysical Journal Letters"]}]

The median spectral index becomes slightly\nflatter (increasing from $\\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.84$ to\n$\\alpha_{150}^{1400}=-0.75$) with decreasing flux density down to $S_{150}\n\\sim$10 mJy before flattening out and remaining constant below this flux level.\nFor a bright subset of the 150-MHz selected sample we can trace the spectral\nproperties down to lower frequencies using 60-MHz LOFAR observations, finding\ntentative evidence for sources to become flatter in spectrum between 60 and 150\nMHz. Using the deep, multi-frequency data available in the Lockman Hole, we\nidentify a sample of 100 Ultra-steep spectrum (USS) sources and 13 peaked\nspectrum sources. We estimate that up to 21 percent of these could have $z>4$\nand are candidate high-$z$ radio galaxies, but further follow-up observations\nare required to confirm the physical nature of these objects.\n","Comment: 26 pages.

As a result, we find that although\nanisotropic radiation fields bring an elongated shadow of neutral gas, almost\nspherical compact star clusters can be procreated from a \"supersonic infall\"\ncloud, since photo-dissociating radiation suppresses the formation of hydrogen\nmolecules in the shadowed regions and the regions are compressed by UV heated\nambient gas. The properties of resultant star clusters match those of GCs. On\nthe other hand, in weak UV radiation fields, dark matter-dominated star\nclusters with low stellar density form due to the self-shielding effect as well\nas the positive feedback by ionizing photons.

This\napproach has been proposed over the years, but its results are typically less\nimpressive compared to the CNN ones.\n  In this work we propose a novel style-transfer algorithm that extends the\ntexture-synthesis work of Kwatra et. al. (2005), while aiming to get stylized\nimages that get closer in quality to the CNN ones. We modify Kwatra's algorithm\nin several key ways in order to achieve the desired transfer, with emphasis on\na consistent way for keeping the content intact in selected regions, while\nproducing hallucinated and rich style in others. The results obtained are\nvisually pleasing and diverse, shown to be competitive with the recent CNN\nstyle-transfer algorithms. The proposed algorithm is fast and flexible, being\nable to process any pair of content + style images.\n"]}]

In a\npublic-goods game, each individual pays a cost for cooperation, or to prevent\ndefection, and receives a reward from the collected cost in a group. Thus,\ndefection is beneficial for each individual, while cooperation is beneficial\nfor the group. Now, groups (say, countries) consisting of individual players\nalso play games. To study such a multi-level game, we introduce a hierarchical\npublic-goods (HPG) game in which two groups compete for finite resources by\nutilizing costs collected from individuals in each group. Analyzing this HPG\ngame, we found a hierarchical prisoner's dilemma, in which groups choose the\ndefection policy (say, armaments) as a Nash strategy to optimize each group's\nbenefit, while cooperation optimizes the total benefit. On the other hand, for\neach individual within a group, refusing to pay the cost (say, tax) is a Nash\nstrategy, which turns to be a cooperation policy for the group, thus leading to\na hierarchical dilemma. Here, the reward received by one group increases with\nthe population, as does the collected cost. In spite of this, we find that\nthere exists an optimal group size that maximizes its payoff. Furthermore, when\nthe population asymmetry between two groups is large, a smaller group will\nchoose a cooperation policy (say, disarmament) to avoid excessive response from\nthe larger group, which leads to the resolution of the prisoner's dilemma\nbetween the groups. The relevance of the HPG game to policy selection in\nsociety and the optimal size in human or animal groups are discussed\naccordingly.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 10 figures"]}]

However, in some specific cases\nsuch as emergency situations, the only images available may be those acquired\nthrough different kinds of sensors. More precisely, this paper addresses the\nproblem of detecting changes between two multi-band optical images\ncharacterized by different spatial and spectral resolutions. This sensor\ndissimilarity introduces additional issues in the context of operational change\ndetection. To alleviate these issues, classical change detection methods are\napplied after independent preprocessing steps (e.g., resampling) used to get\nthe same spatial and spectral resolutions for the pair of observed images.\nNevertheless, these preprocessing steps tend to throw away relevant\ninformation. Conversely, in this paper, we propose a method that more\neffectively uses the available information by modeling the two observed images\nas spatial and spectral versions of two (unobserved) latent images\ncharacterized by the same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. As they\ncover the same scene, these latent images are expected to be globally similar\nexcept for possible changes in sparse spatial locations. Thus, the change\ndetection task is envisioned through a robust multi-band image fusion method\nwhich enforces the differences between the estimated latent images to be\nspatially sparse. This robust fusion problem is formulated as an inverse\nproblem which is iteratively solved using an efficient block-coordinate descent\nalgorithm.

However, the modeling\nof population dynamics in biofilms from the viewpoint of social interactions,\ni.e. interplay between heterotypic strains, and the analysis of this kind using\ncontrol theory are not addressed significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we\ntheoretically analyze the population dynamics model in microbial biofilms with\nnon-participating strains (coexisting with public goods producers and\nnon-producers) in the context of evolutionary game theory and nonlinear\ndynamics. Our analysis of the replicator dynamics model is twofold: first\nwithout the inclusion of spatial pattern, and second with the consideration of\ndegree of assortment. In the first case, Lyapunov stability analysis of the\nstable equilibrium point of the proposed replicator system determines (1,0)\n('full dominance of cooperators') as a global asymptotic stable equilibrium\nwhenever the return exceeds the metabolic cost of cooperation. Hence, the\nglobal asymptotic stable nature of (1,0) in the context of non-consideration of\nspatial pattern helps to justify mathematically the adversity in the\neradication of \"cooperative enterprise\" that is an infectious biofilm. In the\nsecond case, we found non-existence of global asymptotic stability in the\nsystem, and it unveils two additional phenomena - bistability and coexistence.\nIn this context, two inequality conditions are derived for the 'full dominance\nof cooperators' and coexistence. Therefore, the inclusion of spatial pattern in\nbiofilms with non-competing strains intends conditional dominance of pathogenic\n(with respect to the hosts) public goods producers which can be an effective\nstrategy towards the control of an infectious biofilm with the drug-dependent\nregulation of degree of segregation.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures,.

The\nbasic computing element is composed of a lateral spin valve (SV) with two\nferromagnetic (FM) wires served as interconnects, where DW automotion is used\nto propagate the information from one device to another. The non-reciprocity of\nboth device and interconnect is realized by sizing different contact areas at\nthe input and the output as well as enhancing the local damping mechanism. The\nproposed logic is suitable for scaling due to a high energy barrier provided by\na long FM wire. Compared to the scheme based on non-local spin valves (NLSVs)\nin the previous proposal, the devices can be operated at lower current density\ndue to utilizing all injected spins for local magnetization reversals, and thus\nimprove both energy efficiency and resistance to electromigration. This device\nconcept is justified by simulating a buffer, an inverter, and a 3-input\nmajority gate with comprehensive numerical simulations, including spin\ntransport through the FM/non-magnetic (NM) interfaces as well as the NM channel\nand stochastic magnetization dynamics inside FM wires.

We will\npresent a primer on the current state of knowledge concerning these problems,\nand discuss the relation of these problems to one of the most challenging\nquestions of linear algebra: the classification and characterization of\npositive operator maps.\n","Comment: 11 pages latex, 1 eps figure.
