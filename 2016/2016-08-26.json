A tropical complex\n$\\Gamma$ is a $\\Delta$-complex equipped with certain algebraic data. Divisors\nin a tropical complex are formal linear combinations of ridges, and\npiecewise-linear functions on a tropical complex give rise in a natural way to\ndivisors. Divisors that arise from PL-functions are called principal, and\ndivisors that are locally principal are called Cartier. Two divisors that\ndiffer by a principal divisor are said to be linearly equivalent. The linear\nequivalence classes of Cartier divisors on a tropical complex $\\Gamma$ form a\ngroup called the Picard group of $\\Gamma$, by analogy to the definition of the\nPicard group of a variety in algebraic geometry.\n  Every graph has a unique tropical complex structure. If $G$ and $H$ are\ngraphs, and $\\Gamma$ is a triangulation of their product, then $\\Gamma$ has a\nweak tropical complex structure that is compatible with the tropical complex\nstructures on $G$ and $H$. Thus, divisors on $\\Gamma$ can be thought of as\nstates in a higher-dimensional chip-firing game on $\\Gamma$. Cartwright\nconjectured that the Picard groups of $\\Gamma$, $G$, and $H$ were closely\nrelated. Let $Pic(\\Gamma)$ be the tropical Picard group of $\\Gamma$, and\n$Pic(G)$ and $Pic(H)$ be the tropical Picard groups of $G$ and $H$. Then, it\nwas conjectured that there is a map $\\gamma: Pic(G) \\times Pic(H) \\to\nPic(\\Gamma)$ that is always injective and is surjective if at least one of $G$\nor $H$ is a tree.\n  In this paper, we prove the conjecture.

The first mechanism is based on the assumption that\neach node establishes links with its neighbors and introduces new nodes to the\ncommunity at different rates.

This observation is\nrelated to the anthropological theory known as Dunbar's number, i.e., the\nempirical observation of a maximal number of ties which an average individual\ncan sustain within its social groups.

Specifically addressing the hidden\nsemi-Markov model (HSMM) that represents such state duration inside a model, we\nattempt to newly add representational capability of state interval of events\nonto HSMM. To this end, we propose two extended models; one is interval state\nhidden semi-Markov model (IS-HSMM) to express the length of state interval with\na special state node designated as \"interval state node\". The other is interval\nlength probability hidden semi-Markov model (ILP-HSMM) which repre- sents the\nlength of state interval with a new probabilistic parameter \"interval length\nprobability.\" From exhaustive simulations, we show superior performances of the\nproposed models in comparison with HSMM. To the best of our knowledge, our\nproposed models are the first extensions of HMM to support state interval\nrepresentation as well as state duration representation.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 20 figures"]}]

The power of the model lies in its\nability to directly model the discriminative relation between products and a\nparticular word. We compare our method to existing latent vector space models\n(LSI, LDA and word2vec) and evaluate it as a feature in a learning to rank\nsetting. Our latent vector space model achieves its enhanced performance as it\nlearns better product representations. Furthermore, the mapping from words to\nproducts and the representations of words benefit directly from the errors\npropagated back from the product representations during parameter estimation.\nWe provide an in-depth analysis of the performance of our model and analyze the\nstructure of the learned representations.\n","Comment: CIKM2016, Proceedings of the 25th ACM International Conference on\n  Information and Knowledge Management. 2016"]}]
