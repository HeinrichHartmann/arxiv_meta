The question is relevant to\nmany fields such as, for example, array processing, radar, wireless\ncommunications, data compression, dimensionality reduction, and biomedical\nengineering. The desired property of having the same beampattern for different\ncolumns of a beamspace transformation matrix (beamforming vectors) often plays\na key importance in practical applications. The result is that at most\n2^{M-1}-1 beamforming vectors with the same beampattern can be generated from\nany given beamforming vector. Here M is the dimension of the beamforming\nvector. At the constructive side, the answer to this question allows for\ncomputationally efficient techniques for the beamspace transformation design.\nIndeed, one can start with a single beamforming vector, which gives a desired\nbeampattern, and generate a number of other beamforming vectors, which give\nabsolutely the same beampattern, in a computationally efficient way.

Whether initially\nweak magnetic fields can be amplified by this instability to dynamically\nrelevant strengths is still a matter of debate. One of the main uncertainties\nconcerns the process that terminates the growth of the instability.

Finding the correct floor, in a fast and efficient manner, in a\nshopping mall or an unknown university building can save the users' search time\nand can enable a myriad of Location Based Services in the future. One of the\nmost widely spread techniques for floor estimation in multi-floor buildings is\nthe fingerprinting-based localization using Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nmeasurements coming from indoor networks, such as WLAN and BLE. The clear\nadvantage of RSS-based floor estimation is its ease of implementation on a\nmultitude of mobile devices at the Application Programming Interface (API)\nlevel, because RSS values are directly accessible through API interface.\nHowever, the downside of a fingerprinting approach, especially for large-scale\nfloor estimation and positioning solutions, is their need to store and transmit\na huge amount of fingerprinting data. The problem becomes more severe when the\nlocalization is intended to be done on mobile devices which have limited\nmemory, power, and computational resources. An alternative floor estimation\nmethod, which has lower complexity and is faster than the fingerprinting is the\nWeighted Centroid Localization (WCL) method.

We do this by first\nconstructing a holographic $c$-function using causal horizon in the black brane\ngeometry. The UV value of the $c$-function is $a_{UV}$ and then it decreases\nmonotonically to zero at the curvature singularity. Intuitively, the behavior\nof the $c$-function can be understood if we recognize that the dual CFT is in a\nthermal state and thermal states are effectively massive with a gap set by the\ntemperature. In field theory, logarithmic entanglement negativity is an\nentanglement measure for mixed states. For example, in two dimensional CFTs on\ninfinite line at finite temperature, the renormalized entanglement negativity\nof an interval has UV (Low- T) value $c_{UV}$ and IR (High-T) value zero. So\nthis is a potential candidate for our $c$-function. In four dimensions we\nexpect the same thing to hold on physical grounds. Now since the causal horizon\ngoes behind the black brane horizon the holographic $c$-function is sensitive\nto the physics of the interior. Correspondingly the field theory $c$-function\nshould also contain information about the interior. So our results suggest that\nhigh temperature (IR) expansion of the negativity (or any candidate\n$c$-function) may be a way to probe part of the physics near the singularity.\nNegativity at finite temperature depends on the full operator content of the\ntheory and so perhaps this can be be done in specific cases only.\n  The existence of this $c$-function in the bulk is an extreme example of the\nparadigm that space-time is built out of entanglement.

It is also found that very long boxes,\n$L_x \\gtrsim 2 L_y$, couple with the passing period of the shear-periodic\nboundary condition, and develop strong unphysical linearized bursts. Within\nthose limits, the flow shows interesting similarities and differences with\nother shear flows, and in particular with the logarithmic layer of wall-bounded\nturbulence.

The bursting time\nscale is approximately universal, $\\sim 20 S^{-1}$, and the availability of two\ndifferent bursting systems allows the growth of the bursts to be related with\nsome confidence to the shearing of initially isotropic turbulence.

This\npaper focuses on a two-fold problem. On the one hand, the interface description\nlanguage must be flexible enough for maintaining service compatibility in a\nvariety of different contexts without modification of the service itself. On\nthe other hand, the composition of interfaces in a distributed environment must\nbe provably consistent. The existing approaches for checking compatibility of\nservice choreographies are either inflexible (WS-CDL and WSCI) or require\nbehaviour specification associated with each service, which is often impossible\nto provide in practice.\n  We present a novel approach for automatic interface configuration in\ndistributed stream-connected components operating as closed-source services\n(i.e. the behavioural protocol is unknown). We introduce a Message Definition\nLanguage (MDL), which can extend the existing interfaces description languages,\nsuch as WSDL, with support of subtyping, inheritance and polymorphism. The MDL\nsupports configuration variables that link input and output interfaces of a\nservice and propagate requirements over an application graph.

Topological insulators have bulk\nenergy gap and topologically protected gapless edge states. The edge states in\nelectronic systems have been detected by observing the transport properties the\nHgte quantum wells. The electromagnetic analogues of such electronic edge\nstates have been predicted and observed in photonic crystals, coupled\nresonators and linear circuits. However, the edge state spectrums of the two\ndimensional insulators and their electromagnetic analogues haven't been\ndirectly measured and thus the gaplessness of the edge states hasn't been\nexperimentally confirmed. Here I show the classical strings are more convenient\nchoice to study the topological phases than the electromagnetic waves. I found\nthat classical strings with periodic densities can simulate a variety of\ntopological phases in condensed matter physics including two dimensional\ntopological insulators, three dimensional topological semimetals and weak\ntopological insulators. Because the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the\nstrings can be easily measured, not only the gapless edge state spectrum but\nalso the bulk topological invariant can now be directly observed. Further more\nI show the topological phase transitions can be simulated by the strings. My\nresults show the richness of topological phases of mechanical waves.

Nevertheless, their\ncombination suffers from three significant disadvantages. The first is that\nthey attempt to compute only the part of the diagram that is continuously\nconnected to the initial data; disconnected branches are overlooked. The second\nis that the subproblems required (typically determinant calculation and\nnullspace construction) are expensive and hard to scale to very large\ndiscretizations. The third is that they can miss connected branches associated\nwith nonsimple bifurcations, such as when an eigenvalue of even multiplicity\ncrosses the origin. Without expert knowledge or lucky guesses, these techniques\nalone can paint an incomplete picture of the dynamics of a system.\n  In this paper we propose a new algorithm for computing bifurcation diagrams,\ncalled deflated continuation, that is capable of overcoming all three of these\ndisadvantages. The algorithm combines classical continuation with a deflation\ntechnique that elegantly eliminates known branches from consideration, allowing\nthe discovery of disconnected branches with Newton's method. Deflated\ncontinuation does not rely on any device for detecting bifurcations and does\nnot involve computing eigendecompositions; all subproblems required in deflated\ncontinuation can be solved efficiently if a good preconditioner is available\nfor the underlying nonlinear problem. We prove sufficient conditions for the\nconvergence of Newton's method to multiple solutions from the same initial\nguess, providing insight into which unknown branches will be discovered. We\nillustrate the success of the method on several examples where standard\ntechniques fail.\n"]}]
