For efficiency and distributed\ncontrol, it is common in distributed systems and algorithms to group nodes into\nintersecting sets referred to as quorum sets. We show efficiency and\ndistributed control can also be accomplished in optical network routing by\napplying the same established quorum set theory. Cycle-based optical network\nrouting, whether using SONET rings or p-cycles, provides the sufficient\nreliability in the network. Light-trails forming a cycle allow broadcasts\nwithin a cycle to be used for efficient multicasts. Cyclic quorum sets also\nhave all pairs of nodes occurring in one or more quorums, so efficient,\narbitrary unicast communication can occur between any two nodes. Efficient\nbroadcasts to all network nodes are possible by a node broadcasting to all\nquorum cycles to which it belongs (O(sqrt(N))). In this paper, we propose\napplying the distributed efficiency of the quorum sets to routing optical\ncycles based on light-trails. With this new method of topology construction,\nunicast and multicast communication requests do not need to be known or even\nmodeled a priori. Additionally, in the presence of network link faults, greater\nthan 99 % average coverage enables the continued operation of nearly all\narbitrary unicast and multicast requests in the network. Finally, to further\nimprove the fault coverage, an augmentation to the ECBRA cycle finding\nalgorithm is proposed.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1608.05170,\n  arXiv:1608.05172"]}]
