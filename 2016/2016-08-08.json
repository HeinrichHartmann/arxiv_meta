This approach provides new\ninsights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying\nconfinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a\nrelativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective\nconfinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS\nspace. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron\nspectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods\ndescribed here gives a precise interpretation of holographic variables and\nquantities in AdS in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This\nleads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant\nlight-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound\nstates in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the\nexcitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states\nlie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and\norbital quantum numbers. In the light-front holographic approach described here\ncurrents are expressed as an infinite sum of poles, and form factors as a\nproduct of poles. At large $q^2$ the form factor incorporates the correct\npower-law fall-off for hard scattering independent of the specific dynamics and\nis dictated by the twist. At low $q^2$ the form factor leads to vector\ndominance. The approach is also extended to include small quark masses.

This allows us to determine redshifts in spectra in emission as well\nas in absorption without using any predefined model.

In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but\nalso their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast\nreconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the\ncore region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model\nis able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the\nother hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend\nas that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray\nemission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another\npopulation of relativistic particles, as expected.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 8 figures, accepted to be published in the ApJ"]}]

Here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of LOFAR and present\nrealistic simulations of the leakages between Stokes parameters. From the LOFAR\nobservations of polarized emission in the 3C196 field, we have quantified the\nlevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of LOFAR, and\ncompared it with the EoR signal using power spectrum analysis. We found that at\n134--166 MHz, within the central 4$^\\circ$ of the field the $(Q,U)\\rightarrow\nI$ leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at $k<0.3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The\nleakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of\nthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to\nvary between 0.2-0.3\\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal of\nleakage. Moreover, we could define an `EoR window' in terms of the polarization\nleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the PSF-induced wedge and below\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\\perp$ when 70\\% of the leakage had\nbeen removed.

Our sample consists of nine Swift GRBs,\neight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-duration\nclass. Dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the Milky Way and\nthe two Magellanic Clouds.

In one analysed case (GRB 120119A),\nthe common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observed\nextinction. To illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality X-shooter\nafterglow SEDs over the photometric SEDs, we repeat the modeling using the\nbroadband SEDs with the NIR-to-UV photometric measurements instead of the\nspectra. The main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to a\ncombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the SED,\nare more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore the\ndust properties in GRB hosts with respect to photometric measurements. In all\ncases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over the\nothers. We show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectral\nslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric SED analysis, can differ\nsignificantly for individual events. Finally we stress that, regardless of the\nresolution of the optical-to-NIR data, the SED modeling gives reliable results\nonly when the fit is performed on a SED covering a broader spectral region.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics"]}]

The ability of chains of coupled\nunits to undergo spontaneous conformational transitions can lead to a\nself-organised escape. The mechanism at work is that the energies of the units\nbecome re-arranged, while keeping the total energy conserved, in forming\nlocalised energy modes that in turn trigger the cooperative escape. We present\nscenarios of significantly enhanced noise-free escape rates if compared to the\nnoise-assisted case.\n  The second part deals with the collective directed transport of systems of\ninteracting particles overcoming energetic barriers in periodic potential\nlandscapes.

These experiments involve\nthe interaction of an extremal or a slightly sub-extremal black hole with a\ntest particle or field, attempting to destroy the horizon, i.e. to create a\nso-called naked singularity. They usually conclude that WCCC cannot be violated\nstarting from an extremal black hole, but may be violated starting from a\nslightly sub-extremal one, if backreaction and self-force effects are\nneglected. Some other works also analyze these effects.\n  Starting 2007, a string of papers argue if WCCC can be violated by\nclassically forbidden interactions occuring via the quantum nature of the\nparticles associated with the fields; and where backrection and/or\nsuperradiance are pointed out as effects working in the direction of preserving\nthe WCCC. We correct/modify a backrection argument, and furthermore point out\nthat superradiance does not prevent {\\em single particles} from being captured\nby the black hole; even if this capture would lead to WCCC violation.\n  Then we consider the spontaneous emission (which we call the Zel'dovich-Unruh\neffect) of particles by the black hole, and find that at least for scalars, it\ncan be understood without second quantization. It also completely invalidates\nthe mentioned single- or few-particle thought experiments. However, the\nconclusions of our previous work on (at least) scalar fields interacting with\nblack holes, i.e. that WCCC may be violated starting from slightly subextremal\nblack holes, remains valid in this (semi)classical framework.\n"]}]

Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}. However\nthese procedures are based on the formal theory of systems of ordinary\ndifferential (OD) or partial differential (PD) equations, in particular on a\nsystematic use of the Spencer operator, and are still not acknowledged by the\nalgebraic community.\n"]}]

The large scatter in the stellar masses and sizes of the\ncDs reflects their different merger histories.

CAIR preserves route diversity, is highly efficient, and\nwell-suited to monitor BGP path changes in real-time. We formally derive\nimplementable search patterns for route leaks and interception attacks. In\ncontrast to the state-of-the-art, we can detect these incidents.

In order to\nbridge this gap, we propose a new method suitable to decouple slow from fast\ndegrees of freedom in many cases. Based on the recurrence statistics of\nunsteady flow fields, we deduce a recurrence process which enables the generic\nrepresentation of pseudo-periodic motion at high spatial and temporal\nresolution. Based on these fields, passive scalars can be traced by recurrence\nCFD. While a first, Eulerian Model A solves a passive transport equation in a\nclassical implicit finite-volume environment, a second, Lagrangian Model B\npropagates fluid particles obeying a stochastic differential equation\nexplicitly. Finally, this new concept is tested by two multiphase processes - a\nlab scale oscillating bubble column and an industrial scale steelmaking\nconverter. Results of tracer distribution obtained by recurrence CFD are in\nvery good agreement with full CFD simulations, while computational times are\ndramatically reduced. Actually, recurrence CFD is a promising candidate for\nonline simulations of passive transport processes at full CFD resolution, which\nopens the door towards improved process monitoring.\n","Comment: final version, accepted for publication in Chemical Engineering\n  Science"]}]

SVDD based K-chart was\nfirst introduced by Sun and Tsung for monitoring multivariate processes when\nunderlying distribution of process parameters or quality characteristics depart\nfrom Normality. The method first trains a SVDD model on data obtained from\nstable or in-control operations of the process to obtain a threshold $R^2$ and\nkernel center a. For each new observation, its Kernel distance from the Kernel\ncenter a is calculated. The kernel distance is compared against the threshold\n$R^2$ to determine if the observation is within the control limits. The\nnon-parametric K-chart provides an attractive alternative to the traditional\ncontrol charts such as the Hotelling's $T^2$ charts when distribution of the\nunderlying multivariate data is either non-normal or is unknown. But there are\nchallenges when K-chart is deployed in practice.

Ionizing\nradiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF\ninitiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot\nreally assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their\nsizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end\nslope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first such size\nconstraints with 2 new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the\ndetectability of highly-magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very\ndependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies will remain\ndetectable in regions of high shear (vs. a larger detectable size range for low\nshear), a phenomenon we carefully quantify using simulations. Remarkably,\nhowever, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies\nand the predicted shear, using 87 faint high-magnification mu>10 z~2-8 galaxies\nseen behind the first 4 HFF clusters. This can only be the case if such faint\n(~-15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than luminous galaxies. We\nconstrain their half-light radii to be <~30 mas (<160-240 pc). As a 2nd size\nprobe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major\nshear axis. Less elongation is found than even for objects with an intrinsic\nhalf-light radius of 10 mas. Together these results indicate that extremely\nfaint z~2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles in the HFF dataset\n(half-light radii conservatively <30 mas and likely 5-10 mas). These results\nsuggest smaller completeness corrections and hence much lower volume densities\nfor faint z~2-8 galaxies and shallower faint-end slopes than have been derived\nin many recent studies (by factors of ~2-3 and by dalpha>~0.1-0.3).\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables, submitted to ApJ, key results shown\n  in Figures 2, 6, 8, and 12, including some minor changes to improve the\n  overall clarity"]}]

Of special interest is\nthe problem of generating such representations directly from natural language\n(NL) or controlled natural language (CNL).

Contrary to the conventional two-way relay\nnetworks, we consider the scenario that the AF relay has no embedded energy\nsupply, and it is equipped with an energy harvesting unit and rechargeable\nbattery. As such, it can accumulate the energy harvested from both sources'\nsignals before helping forwarding their information.

To determine whether the relay has accumulated sufficient energy, we\nset a predefined energy threshold for the relay. When the accumulated energy\nreaches the threshold, relay splits the received signal power into two parts,\none for energy harvesting and the other for information forwarding. If the\nstored energy at the relay is below the threshold, all the received signal\npower will be accumulated at the relay's battery. By modeling the\nfinite-capacity battery of relay as a finite-state Markov Chain (MC), we derive\na closed-form expression for the system throughput of the proposed PS-EA scheme\nover Nakagami-m fading channels.

The\npaper is a pioneering attempt of formulating a mathematical foundation for\nrealizing a multiview aided collaborative boosting architecture for multiclass\nclassification. Most of the present algorithms apply multiview learning\nheuristically without exploring the fundamental mathematical changes imposed on\ntraditional boosting. Also, most of the algorithms are restricted to two class\nor view setting. Our proposed mathematical framework enables collaborative\nboosting across any finite dimensional view spaces for multiclass learning. The\nboosting framework is based on forward stagewise additive model which minimizes\na novel exponential loss function.
