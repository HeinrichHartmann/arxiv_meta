This approach provides new\ninsights into the origin of a fundamental mass scale and the physics underlying\nconfinement dynamics in QCD in the limit of massless quarks. The result is a\nrelativistic light-front wave equation for arbitrary spin with an effective\nconfinement potential derived from a conformal action and its embedding in AdS\nspace. This equation allows for the computation of essential features of hadron\nspectra in terms of a single scale. The light-front holographic methods\ndescribed here gives a precise interpretation of holographic variables and\nquantities in AdS in terms of light-front variables and quantum numbers. This\nleads to a relation between the AdS wave functions and the boost-invariant\nlight-front wave functions describing the internal structure of hadronic bound\nstates in physical space-time. The pion is massless in the chiral limit and the\nexcitation spectra of relativistic light-quark meson and baryon bound states\nlie on linear Regge trajectories with identical slopes in the radial and\norbital quantum numbers.

In the present\nwork, we revisit this model comparing two different fast magnetic reconnection\nmechanisms, namely, fast reconnection driven by anomalous resistivity (AR) and\nby turbulence (as described in Lazarian and Vishiniac 1999). We apply the\nscenario above to a much larger sample of sources (including also blazars, and\ngamma-ray bursts - GRBs), and find that LLAGNs and microquasars do confirm the\ntrend above. Furthermore, when driven by turbulence, not only their radio but\nalso their gamma-ray emission can be due to magnetic power released by fast\nreconnection, which may accelerate particles to relativistic velocities in the\ncore region of these sources. Thus the turbulent-driven fast reconnection model\nis able to reproduce better the observed emission than the AR model. On the\nother hand, the emission from blazars and GRBs does not follow the same trend\nas that of the LLAGNs and microquasars, suggesting that the radio and gamma-ray\nemission in these cases is produced further out along the jet, by another\npopulation of relativistic particles, as expected.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 8 figures, accepted to be published in the ApJ"]}]

We show that all universality classes predicted by\nmode coupling theory for two conservation laws are generic: They occur in\ntwo-component systems with nonlinearities in the associated currents already of\nthe minimal order $\\rho_\\lambda^2\\rho_\\mu$. The macroscopic stationary\ncurrent-density relation and the compressibility matrix determine completely\nall permissible universality classes through the mode coupling coefficients\nwhich we compute explicitly for general two-component systems.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 11 figures, a reference added, some typos corrected and\n  some figures replaced + various cosmetic changes"]}]

Besides the\nLyman $\\alpha$ line, the spectra contain a number of metal absorption features\nallowing us to probe the kinematics of the neutral ISM and evaluate the optical\ndepth and and covering fraction of the neutral medium as a function of\nline-of-sight velocity. Furthermore, we show how this, in combination with\nprecise determination of systemic velocity and good Ly$\\alpha$ spectra, can be\nused to distinguish a model in which separate clumps together fully cover the\nbackground source, from the \"picket fence\" model named by Heckman et al.\n(2011). We find that no one single effect dominates in governing Ly$\\alpha$\nradiative transfer and escape. Ly$\\alpha$ escape in our sample coincides with a\nmaximum velocity-binned covering fraction of $\\lesssim 0.9$ and bulk outflow\nvelocities of $\\gtrsim 50$ km s$^{-1}$, although a number of galaxies show\nthese characteristics and yet little or no Ly$\\alpha$ escape. We find that\nLy$\\alpha$ peak velocities, where available, are not consistent with a strong\nbackscattered component, but rather with a simpler model of an intrinsic\nemission line overlaid by a blueshifted absorption profile from the outflowing\nwind. Finally, we find a strong anticorrelation between H$\\alpha$ equivalent\nwidth and maximum velocity-binned covering factor, and propose a heuristic\nexplanatory model.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 19 figures, 5 tables"]}]

Here, we discuss the instrumental polarization of LOFAR and present\nrealistic simulations of the leakages between Stokes parameters. From the LOFAR\nobservations of polarized emission in the 3C196 field, we have quantified the\nlevel of polarization leakage caused by the nominal model beam of LOFAR, and\ncompared it with the EoR signal using power spectrum analysis. We found that at\n134--166 MHz, within the central 4$^\\circ$ of the field the $(Q,U)\\rightarrow\nI$ leakage power is lower than the EoR signal at $k<0.3$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The\nleakage was found to be localized around a Faraday depth of 0, and the rms of\nthe leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission was shown to\nvary between 0.2-0.3\\%, both of which could be utilized in the removal of\nleakage. Moreover, we could define an `EoR window' in terms of the polarization\nleakage in the cylindrical power spectrum above the PSF-induced wedge and below\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 0.5$ Mpc$^{-1}$, and the window extended up to\n$k_\\parallel\\sim 1$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at all $k_\\perp$ when 70\\% of the leakage had\nbeen removed.

Our sample consists of nine Swift GRBs,\neight of them belonging to the long-duration and one to the short-duration\nclass. Dust is modeled using the average extinction curves of the Milky Way and\nthe two Magellanic Clouds.

In one analysed case (GRB 120119A),\nthe common extinction curve templates fail to reproduce the observed\nextinction. To illustrate the advantage of using the high-quality X-shooter\nafterglow SEDs over the photometric SEDs, we repeat the modeling using the\nbroadband SEDs with the NIR-to-UV photometric measurements instead of the\nspectra. The main result is that the spectroscopic data, thanks to a\ncombination of excellent resolution and coverage of the blue part of the SED,\nare more successful in constraining the extinction curves and therefore the\ndust properties in GRB hosts with respect to photometric measurements. In all\ncases but one the extinction curve of one template is preferred over the\nothers. We show that the modeled values of the extinction and the spectral\nslope, obtained through spectroscopic and photometric SED analysis, can differ\nsignificantly for individual events. Finally we stress that, regardless of the\nresolution of the optical-to-NIR data, the SED modeling gives reliable results\nonly when the fit is performed on a SED covering a broader spectral region.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics"]}]

We conclude that the\nradio emission arises from: i) highly-variable non-thermal gyrosynchrotron\nemission produced by electrons accelerated in the magnetospheres of pre-main\nsequence stars; ii) thermal emission from ionized gas and/or heated dust around\nmassive objects and proplyds.

The ability of chains of coupled\nunits to undergo spontaneous conformational transitions can lead to a\nself-organised escape. The mechanism at work is that the energies of the units\nbecome re-arranged, while keeping the total energy conserved, in forming\nlocalised energy modes that in turn trigger the cooperative escape. We present\nscenarios of significantly enhanced noise-free escape rates if compared to the\nnoise-assisted case.\n  The second part deals with the collective directed transport of systems of\ninteracting particles overcoming energetic barriers in periodic potential\nlandscapes.

We\nderive the radial velocity of all stars, and the atmospheric chemical mix\n([Fe/H], C/O, $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C, Al, Si, Ti, and Y) where possible.

We also detected 26-ks pulsations in CG X-1, consistently\nwith previous measures. For ~40 other sources, we obtained limits on periodic\nmodulations. In CXO J141430.1-651621, which is ~2 arcmin outside the Circinus\ngalaxy, we detected signals at 6120(1) s and 64.2(5) ks. In the longest\nobservation, the source showed a flux of ~1.1e-13 erg/cm^2/s (absorbed, 0.5-10\nkeV) and the spectrum could be described by a power-law with photon index ~1.4.\nFrom archival observations, we found that the luminosity is variable by ~50 per\ncent on time-scales of weeks-years. The two periodicities pin down CXO\nJ141430.1-651621 as a cataclysmic variable of the intermediate polar subtype.\nThe period of CXOU J141332.9-651756 is 6378(3) s. It is located inside the\nCircinus galaxy, but the low absorption indicates a Galactic foreground object.\nThe flux was ~5e-14 erg/cm^2/s in the Chandra observations and showed ~50 per\ncent variations on weekly/yearly scales; the spectrum is well fit by a power\nlaw ~0.9. These characteristics and the large modulation suggest that CXOU\nJ141332.9-651756 is a magnetic cataclysmic variable, probably a polar. For CG\nX-1, we show that if the source is in the Circinus galaxy, its properties are\nconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet plus black hole binary. We consider the\nimplications of this for ultraluminous X-ray sources and the prospects of\nAdvanced LIGO and Virgo. In particular, from the current sample of WR-BH\nsystems we estimate an upper limit to the detection rate of stellar BH-BH\nmergers of ~16 events per yr.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables; accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

The problem of quantum state reconstruction is connected with the\nnotion known as phase retrieval -- recovering a complex vector from modulus of\ninner product with frame vectors. Phase retrieval is widely studied in many\nareas of science but still there is a number of problems that remain to be\nanswered. We believe that the dynamic approach can significantly improve the\neffectiveness of the vector reconstruction as it aims to decrease the number of\ndistinct projectors by taking advantage of the knowledge about the evolution.\nGeneral conditions and observations are applied to a specific unitary evolution\nmodel.\n"]}]

Comparison between the\nevolutionary yields of elements such as CNO and the corresponding observed\nchemical abundances is a powerful tool to shed light on evolutionary processes\nsuch as hot bottom burning (HBB) and third dredge-up (TDU). We found that the\noccurrence of HBB is needed to interpret the nitrogen-enriched (log(N/H)+12>8)\nPNe. In particular, N-rich PNe with the lowest carbon content are nicely\nreproduced by AGB models of mass M >=6 Mo, whose surface chemistry reflects the\npure effects of HBB. PNe with log(N/H)+12<7.5 correspond to ejecta of stars\nthat have not experienced HBB, with initial mass below about 3 Mo. Some of\nthese stars show very large carbon abundances, owing to the many TDU episodes\nexperienced. We found from our LMC PN sample that there is a threshold to the\namount of carbon accumulated at AGB surfaces, log(C/H)+12<9. Confirmation of\nthis constraint would indicate that, after the C-star stage is reached,AGBs\nexperience only a few thermal pulses, which suggests a rapid loss of the\nexternal mantle, probably owing to the effects of radiation pressure on\ncarbonaceous dust particles present in the circumstellar envelope.

Mobility of labor results in heterogenous rates of\nincrease in prices which is called Baumol's cost disease phenomenon.\nHeterogeneous rates of inflation then make it impossible to define an invariant\nmeasure for the real growth rate.

I provide examples in which GDP expands 5 folds while measurements\npercept an expansion around 2 folds. Violation of invariance of the\nmeasurements leads to state that it is hard to compare the growth rate of GDP\nfor a smooth growing country such as the U.S. with a fast growing country such\nas China.

Indeed, on page\n78/79 of this book, Macaulay is saying the following: \" A polynomial ideal\n$\\mathfrak{a} \\subset k[{\\chi}\\_1$,..., ${\\chi}\\_n]=k[\\chi]$ is of the {\\it\nprincipal class} and thus {\\it unmixed} if it has rank $r$ and is generated by\n$r$ polynomials. Having in mind this definition, a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nwith associated prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p} = rad(\\mathfrak{q})$ is such that any\nideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of the principal class with $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset\n\\mathfrak{q}$ determines a primary ideal of greater {\\it multiplicity} over\n$k$. In particular, we have $dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/({\\chi}\\_1$,...,${\\chi}\\_n)^2)=n+1$\nbecause, passing to a system of PD equations for one unknown $y$, the\nparametric jets are \\{${y,y\\_1, ...,y\\_n}$\\} but any ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ of\nthe principal class with $\\mathfrak{a}\\subset ({\\chi}\\_1,{\\^a},{\\chi}\\_n)^2$ is\ncontained into a {\\it simple} ideal, that is a primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$\nsuch that $rad(\\mathfrak{q})=\\mathfrak{m}\\in max(k[\\chi])$ is a maximal and\nthus prime ideal with $dim\\_k(M)=dim\\_k(k[\\chi]/\\mathfrak{q})=2^n$ at least.\nAccordingly, any primary ideal $\\mathfrak{q}$ may not be a member of the\nprimary decomposition of an unmixed ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{q}$\nof the principal class. Otherwise, $\\mathfrak{q}$ is said to be of the {\\it\nprincipal noetherian class} \". Our aim is to explain this result in a modern\nlanguage and to illustrate it by providing a similar example for $n=4$. The\nimportance of such an example is that it allows for the first time to exhibit\nsymbols which are $2,3,4$-acyclic without being involutive. Another interest of\nthis example is that it has properties quite similar to the ones held by the\nsystem of conformal Killing equations which are still not known. For this\nreason, we have put all the examples at the end of the paper and each one is\npresented in a rather independent way though a few among them are quite tricky.\nMeanwhile, the second purpose is to prove that the methods developped by\nMacaulay in order to study {\\it unmixed polynomial ideals} are only particular\nexamples of new formal differential geometric techniques that have been\nintroduced recently in order to study {\\it pure differential modules}.

It is shown\nthat only for those cases, the time-headway distribution is determined by the\nflow regardless to the density. The qualitative comparison of the results with\ntraffic data demonstrates that the genTASEP with backward order and attractive\ninteraction evinces similar properties of time-headway distribution as the real\ntraffic sample.\n","Comment: Preprint submitted to Elsevier"]}]

SVDD based K-chart was\nfirst introduced by Sun and Tsung for monitoring multivariate processes when\nunderlying distribution of process parameters or quality characteristics depart\nfrom Normality. The method first trains a SVDD model on data obtained from\nstable or in-control operations of the process to obtain a threshold $R^2$ and\nkernel center a. For each new observation, its Kernel distance from the Kernel\ncenter a is calculated. The kernel distance is compared against the threshold\n$R^2$ to determine if the observation is within the control limits. The\nnon-parametric K-chart provides an attractive alternative to the traditional\ncontrol charts such as the Hotelling's $T^2$ charts when distribution of the\nunderlying multivariate data is either non-normal or is unknown. But there are\nchallenges when K-chart is deployed in practice. The K-chart requires\ncalculating kernel distance of each new observation but there are no guidelines\non how to interpret the kernel distance plot and infer about shifts in process\nmean or changes in process variation. This limits the application of K-charts\nin big-data applications such as equipment health monitoring, where\nobservations are generated at a very high frequency. In this scenario, the\nanalyst using the K-chart is inundated with kernel distance results at a very\nhigh frequency, generally without any recourse for detecting presence of any\nassignable causes of variation. We propose a new SVDD based control chart,\ncalled as $K_T$ chart, which addresses challenges encountered when using\nK-chart for big-data applications. The $K_T$ charts can be used to\nsimultaneously track process variation and central tendency. We illustrate the\nsuccessful use of $K_T$ chart using the Tennessee Eastman process data.\n"]}]

Ionizing\nradiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF\ninitiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot\nreally assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their\nsizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end\nslope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first such size\nconstraints with 2 new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the\ndetectability of highly-magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very\ndependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies will remain\ndetectable in regions of high shear (vs. a larger detectable size range for low\nshear), a phenomenon we carefully quantify using simulations. Remarkably,\nhowever, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies\nand the predicted shear, using 87 faint high-magnification mu>10 z~2-8 galaxies\nseen behind the first 4 HFF clusters. This can only be the case if such faint\n(~-15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than luminous galaxies. We\nconstrain their half-light radii to be <~30 mas (<160-240 pc). As a 2nd size\nprobe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major\nshear axis. Less elongation is found than even for objects with an intrinsic\nhalf-light radius of 10 mas. Together these results indicate that extremely\nfaint z~2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles in the HFF dataset\n(half-light radii conservatively <30 mas and likely 5-10 mas).

The secure coding scheme presented in\nthis note allows the eavesdropper to observe repair of any $\\ell_2$ ouf of $n$\nnodes in the system and characterizes the secrecy capacity of linear repairable\nMSR codes.\n"]}]

The\npaper is a pioneering attempt of formulating a mathematical foundation for\nrealizing a multiview aided collaborative boosting architecture for multiclass\nclassification. Most of the present algorithms apply multiview learning\nheuristically without exploring the fundamental mathematical changes imposed on\ntraditional boosting.

We apply protection via\ndecoherence-free subspaces and quantum dynamical decoupling to this end. The\nlatter is implemented by inserting phase shifters at regular intervals $\\Delta\n$ inside the fiber, where $\\Delta $ is roughly the ratio of the speed of light\nin the fiber to the bath high-frequency cutoff.

We then study the effect of decoherence on the\nsingle-photon subtracted squeezed states. We present results for two different\nmodels of decoherence, viz. amplitude decay model and the phase diffusion\nmodel. In each case we give analytical results for the time evolution of the\nstate. We discuss the loss of nonclassicality as a result of decoherence. We\nshow through the study of their phase-space properties how these states decay\nto vacuum due to the decay of photons. We show that phase damping leads to very\nslow decoherence than the photon-number decay.\n","Comment: Figures are in GIF format separately, submitted"]}]
