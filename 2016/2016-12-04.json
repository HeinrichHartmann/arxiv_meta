In this paper, we\nconstruct the moving frame and invariants for the discrete centroaffine curves,\nwhich could be used to discriminate the same discrete curves from different\ngraphics, and estimate whether a polygon flow is stable or periodically stable.\nIn fact, using the similar method as the Frenet-Serret frame, a discrete curve\ncan be uniquely identified by its centroaffine curvatures and torsions. In\n1878, Darboux studied the problem of midpoint iteration of polygons[12].\nBerlekamp et al studied this problem in detail[2]. Now, through the\ncentroaffine curvatures and torsions, the iteration process can be clearly\nquantified. Exactly, we describe the whole iteration process by using\ncentroaffine curvatures and torsions, and its periodicity could be directly\nexhibited. As an application, we would obtain some stable discrete space curves\nwith changeless curvatures and torsions after multistep iteration. For the\npentagram map of a polygon, the affinely regular polygons are stable.\nFurthermore, we find the convex hexagons with parallel and equi-length opposite\nsides are periodically stable, and some convex parallel and equi-length\nopposite sides octagons are also periodically stable. The proofs of these\nresults are obtained using the structure equations of the discrete cnetroaffine\ncurves and the integrable conditions of its flows.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 16 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1212.5299 by other authors"]}]
