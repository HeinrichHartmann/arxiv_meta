An order of magnitude scaling\nbetween RHESSI non-thermal energy and GOES peak X-ray flux is established from\na sample of flares from the literature and is used to estimate flare energies\nfrom observed GOES peak X-ray flux. Based on the scaling, we conclude that the\nestimated free energy of AR 11029 on 27 October when the flaring rate peaked is\nsufficient to power M-class or X-class flares, and hence the modeling does not\nappear to support the hypothesis that the absence of large flares is due to the\nregion having limited energy.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Solar Physics"]}]

We propose a phase field approximation based on\nDe Giorgi's diffuse Willmore functional to this variational problem. Our main\ncontribution is a penalisation term which ensures connectedness in the sharp\ninterface limit. The penalisation of disconnectedness is based on a geodesic\ndistance chosen to be small between two points that lie on the same connected\ncomponent of the transition layer of the phase field.\n  We prove that in two dimensions, sequences of phase fields with uniformly\nbounded diffuse Willmore energy and diffuse area converge uniformly to the\nzeros of a double-well potential away from the support of a limiting measure.\nIn three dimensions, we show that they converge $\\mathcal{H}^1$-almost\neverywhere on curves. This enables us to show $\\Gamma$-convergence to a sharp\ninterface problem that only allows for connected structures. The results also\nimply Hausdorff convergence of the level sets in two dimensions and a similar\nresult in three dimensions.\n  We furthermore present numerical evidence of the effectiveness of our model.\nThe implementation relies on a coupling of Dijkstra's algorithm in order to\ncompute the topological penalty to a finite element approach for the Willmore\nterm.\n","Comment: appears in Arch Rational Mech Anal (2016)"]}]

[Phys. Rev. A 87, 022337(2013)] investigated the\ndynamics of quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the presence of decoherence. We\nhere reform their results and propose two schemes to enhance and preserve the\nQFIs for a qubit system subjected to a decoherence noisy environment by\napplying $\\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operators process. The proposed schemes are\nrelated to the $\\textit{prior}$ (or the $\\textit{post}$ ) non-Hermitian\noperator process corresponding to before (or after) the interest system suffers\nfrom decoherence, respectively. Resorting to the Bloch sphere representation,\nwe derive the exact analytical expressions of the QFIs with respect to the\namplitude parameter $\\theta$ and the phase parameter $\\phi$, and in detail\ninvestigate the influence of $\\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operator parameters on\nthe QFIs. Compared with purity decoherence process (without non-Hermitian\noperator process), we find that the $\\textit{post non-Hermitian}$ operator\nprocess can potentially enhance and preserve the QFIs by choosing appropriate\n$\\textit{non-Hermitian}$ operator parameters, while with the help of the\n$\\textit{prior non-Hermitian}$ operator process one could completely eliminate\nthe effect of decoherence to improve the parameters estimation. Finally, a\ngeneralized non-Hermitian operator parameters effect on the parameters\nestimation is also considered.\n"]}]

In this paper, we first present\na novel experimental setup that consists of two near-infrared (NIR) cameras to\npoint to the eye regions and one visible-light RGB camera to capture the\nvisible face region. The main purpose of this paper is to synthesize realistic\nface images without occlusions based on the images captured by these cameras.\nTo this end, we propose a novel synthesis framework that contains four modules:\n3D head reconstruction, face alignment and tracking, face synthesis, and eye\nsynthesis. In face synthesis, we propose a novel algorithm that can robustly\nalign and track a personalized 3D head model given a face that is severely\noccluded by the HMD. In eye synthesis, in order to generate accurate eye\nmovements and dynamic wrinkle variations around eye regions, we propose another\nnovel algorithm to colorize the NIR eye images and further remove the \"red eye\"\neffects caused by the colorization. Results show that both hardware setup and\nsystem framework are robust to synthesize realistic face images in video\nsequences.\n","Comment: 12 pages,15 figures"]}]

In experiments, branched structures exhibit\nlower viscosity as compared to linear and wormlike micelles, presumably due to\nstress relaxation arising from the sliding motion of branches along the main\nchain. Our simulations provide conclusive evidence and a mechanism of branch\nmotion and stress relaxation in micellar fluids. Further, depending upon the\nsurfactant and salt concentrations, which in turn determine the microstructure,\nwe observe normal, subdiffusive and superdiffusive motion of surfactants.\nSpecifically, superdiffusive behavior is associated with branch sliding,\nbreakage and recombination of micelle fragments as well as constraint release\nin entangled systems.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures, Supplementary animation (S1)"]}]

For this aim, we employ four unified equations of state (EoS) for both\nthe cores and crusts, namely BCPM, BSk20, BSk21, Shen-TM1, as well as two\nnon-unified EoS widely used in the literature, i.e. APR and GM1 EoS. All the\ncore EoSs satisfy the recent observational constraints of the two massive\npulsars whose masses are precisely measured. We show that the NS\nmass-equatorial radius relations are slightly affected by the smoothness at the\ncore-crust matching interface. However, the uncertainties in the crust EoS and\nthe matching interface bring insignificant changes, even at maximally rotating\n(Keplerian) configurations. For all four unified EoS, rotations can increase\nthe star's gravitational mass up to $18\\%-19\\%$ and the equatorial radius by\n$29\\%-36\\%$. For stars as heavy as 1.4 M$_{\\odot}$, the radius increase is more\npronounced, reaching $41\\%-43\\%$, i.e. 5 - 6 km. Moreover, by comparing the\npresent calculations with recent simultaneous determinations of mass and radius\nfor two X-ray bursts, 4U 1608-52 and 4U 1724-307, we propose that they might be\nrapidly spinning NSs, in order to account for their measured large radii.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables"]}]

The low temperature Hall effect and resistivity\nmeasurements reveal that the ITO thin films are moderately dis-ordered (kfl~1)\nand degenerate semiconductor. The transport of charge carriers in these\ndisordered ITO thin films takes place via the de-localized states. The disorder\neffects lead to the well- known metal-insulator transition; this transition is\nobserved at 110 K in ITO thin films. The metal-insulator behaviour is explained\nby the quantum correction to the conductivity (QCC); this approach is based on\nthe quantum-mechanical interference effects in the disordered systems. The\ninsulating behaviour is attributed to the combined effect of the weak\nlocalization and the electron-electron interactions.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Our aim is\nto forecast the flux of the vehicles for $n$ consecutive days, by taking as\nprior knowledge previous observations. The formal tools used in our analysis\nconsists in: (1) making use of digraphs that allow the visualization and\nschematization of the problem, where edges correspond to roads, etc. and the\nvertices with loops represent the sites. (2) From an initial set of transition\nprobabilities, that form a Markov chain, or from an empirical distribution of\nvehicles at the vertices and edges, we construct the Markov matrix which is a\nstochastic matrix (SM), and assume that the evolution of the traffic flows\naccording to the power $n$ of the SM and, (3) the use of the Perron-Frobenius\ntheory to analyze the outcomes. We identify several modes or regimes before the\ndistribution of vehicles attains its stationary state, and we calculate the\ncharacteristic decay times of the transient regimes. We analyze: (1) a closed\nfour-site network model, (2) to this network we add an input and an output flux\nof vehicles; asymptotically ($n \\rightarrow \\infty$), each $n$-step Markov\nmatrix goes to a unique stationary one. And (3), we study the traffic flow\nruled by a nonlinear evolution in time; we find out that this model permits the\nexistence of several ($L$) stationary states for the traffic flux. We determine\nthat each stationary matrix should allow to forecast the state of the traffic\nfor each one of chosen $L$ different moments of the day, and that,\nasymptotically, the flux of vehicles is allowed to change with time cyclically,\ngoing from one stationary state to the other.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables"]}]
