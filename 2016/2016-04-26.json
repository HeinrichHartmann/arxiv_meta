It is\nobtained by natural modifications of the well-known leapfrog method, which is a\nsecond order, two-step, explicit method. According to the latter method, the\ninput data for an integration step are two system states, which refer to\ndifferent times. The usage of two states instead of a single one can be seen as\nthe reason for the robustness of the method. Since the time step size thus is\npart of the step input data, it is complicated to change this size during the\ncomputation of a discrete trajectory. This is a serious drawback when one needs\nto implement automatic time step control.\n  The proposed modification transforms one of the two input states into a\nvelocity and thus gets rid of the time step dependency in the step input data.\nFor these new step input data, the leapfrog method gives a unique prescription\nhow to evolve them stepwise.\n  The stability properties of this modified method are the same as for the\noriginal one: the set of absolute stability is the interval [-i,+i] on the\nimaginary axis. This implies exponential growth of trajectories in situations\nwhere the exact trajectory has an asymptote.\n  By considering new evolution steps that are composed of two consecutive old\nevolution steps we can average over the velocities of the sub-steps and get an\nintegrator with a much larger set of absolute stability, which is immune to the\nasymptote problem.\n  The method is exemplified with the equation of motion of a one-dimensional\nnon-linear oscillator describing the radial motion in the Kepler problem.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 25 figures"]}]

In these sectors the massless spectrum, as compared to the\nsupersymmetric cases, will only differ in some local or global U(1) charges.

The partitioning\nof the wave-number space between the (energetically dominant) region where this\nis the case and the region where linear phase mixing wins its competition with\nnonlinear advection is governed by the \"critical balance\" between linear and\nnonlinear timescales (which for high Hermite moments splits into two\nthresholds, one demarcating the wave-number region where phase mixing\npredominates, the other where plasma echo does).\n","Comment: 45 pages (single-column), 3 figures, replaced with version published\n  in JPP"]}]

In more\ncomplex systems, the characteristics of the coherence can display more subtle\nchanges with respect to the parameters of the quantum state. In the case of the\nXXZ Heisenberg model, the coherence changes from a monogamous to a polygamous\nnature. This allows us to define the shareability of coherence, leading to\nmonogamy relations for coherence.\n","Comment: Close to the accepted version"]}]

Our principal result is that the Ts - Tb\nrelations are fairly insensitive to detailed distribution of ion fractions over\nthe envelope (diffusively equilibrated or not) and depend almost solely on\nDeltaM. The obtained relations are approximated by analytic expressions which\nare convenient for modeling the evolution of neutron stars.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, MNRAS, published"]}]

It is a graphical\nrepresentation derived from a flow field and describes the temporal evolution\nof a point. We prove that TFG for an object undergoing periodic motion is also\nperiodic. This principle can be utilized to derive both global and local\ninformation from a given sequence. We demonstrate this for detecting motion\nirregularities at the sequence, as well as regional levels on real and\nsynthetic data. A coarse localisation of anatomical landmarks such as centres\nof left/right cavities and valve points is also demonstrated using TFGs.\n"]}]

The sharpness means the lower and upper bounds for the operators are\nconsistent with the behavior of the linearized operators. Moreover, we make\nclear the difference between the bounds for the original operators and those\nfor the linearized ones.\n  According to the Bobylev's formula, we introduce two types of dyadic\ndecompositions performed in both phase and frequency spaces to make full use of\nthe interaction and the cancellation. It allows us to see clearly which part of\nthe operator behaves like a Laplace type operator and which part is dominated\nby the anisotropic structure. It is the key point to get the sharp bounds in\nweighted Sobolev spaces and in anisotropic spaces. Based on the geometric\nstructure of the elastic collision, we make a geometric decomposition to\ncapture the anisotropic structure of the collision operator.

The structures mentioned above are so stable that we can apply them\nto the rescaled Boltzmann collision operator in the process of the grazing\ncollisions limit.

The challenge is to maintain consistency. That is,\nto answer queries about different edges according to the same spanning tree.\nSince it is known that this problem cannot be solved without essentially\nviewing all the graph, we consider the relaxed version of finding a spanning\nsubgraph with $(1+\\epsilon)n$ edges (where $n$ is the number of vertices and\n$\\epsilon$ is a given sparsity parameter).

Comparing to other unsupervised methods, we\nsucceeded to obtain the lowest total error by using the 512-bit codes for\nretrieval via exhaustive search, and speed up 9.27 times with the use of the\n16-bit codes while keeping a comparable total error. We found that our new\ntraining scheme could reduce the total retrieval error significantly by 21.9%.\nTo further boost the image retrieval performance, we developed Radon\nAutoencoder Barcode (RABC) which are learned from the Radon projections of\nimages using a de-noising autoencoder. Experimental results demonstrated its\nsuperior performance in retrieval when it was combined with DDA binary codes.\n","Comment: To appear in proceedings of The 2016 International Joint Conference\n  on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2016), July 24-29, 2016, Vancouver, Canada"]}]

Thus some researchers believe the gaps are due to\nthe weakness of the proof, but not that of the C-CD algorithm itself.\n  In this paper we show that the gaps indeed exist.
