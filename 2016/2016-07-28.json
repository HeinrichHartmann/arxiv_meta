The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the\nwell-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called\n`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,\nprovided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum\nuncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.\nHowever, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a\nsuperposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area\nlaw is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,\nso that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On\nascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to\nthe entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees\nof freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the\ncontributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for\nexcited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from\nthe area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the\nfar-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced\nover) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.\nAlthough most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a\nhypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we\nshow that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static\nasymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon.\n","Comment: Invited Review.

Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered\nthe adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from\nbirth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among\ngenetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic\ncomponent in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder\nprinciple, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically\nexpressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division\ntime is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a\nfixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean\ncell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in\ntiming increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the\ndistribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is\nindependent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in\nexperimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to\ndifferent newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other. The model provides\nfurther insights consistent with experimental observations: the distributions\nof the added volume and the cell-division time when scaled by their respective\nmeans become invariant of the growth rate. Finally, we discuss various\nmodifications to the proposed model that lead to deviations from the adder\nprinciple.

A convex free energy is\nconstructed using the recently proposed fractional free energy, and optimised\nusing a primal-dual coordinate ascent.

However, in many cases, the pairwise\ncomparison matrix is difficult to complete, which obstructs the subsequent\noperations of the clas- sical AHP. In this paper, based on DEMATEL which has\nability to derive the total relation matrix from direct relation matrix, a new\ncompletion method for incomplete pairwise comparison matrix is proposed. The\nproposed method provides a new per- spective to estimate the missing values\nwith explicit physical meaning. Besides, the proposed method has low\ncomputational cost. This promising method has a wide application in\nmulti-criteria decision-making.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]

To obtain such benefits, we need to have not only good\nestimates of how the traffic is formed but also to have target strategies to\nreduce enough vehicles from the best possible roads in a feasible way. The\nopportunity is that during large events the traffic inconveniences in large\ncities are unusually high, yet temporary, and the entire population may be more\nwilling to adopt collective recommendations for social good. In this paper, we\nintegrate for the first time big data resources to quantify the impact of\nevents and propose target strategies for collective good at urban scale.

The method provides an analytical solution for\nthe computation of precise p-values when its assumptions are met. When its\nassumptions are not met the thresholds generated by Random Field Theory can be\nmore conservative than Bonferroni corrections, which are arguably too stringent\nfor use in fMRI. As this has been well documented theoretically it is\nsurprising that a majority of current studies (~80%) would not meet the\nassumptions of Random Field Theory and therefore would have reduced\nsensitivity. Specifically most data is not smooth enough to meet the good\nlattice assumption. Current studies smooth data on average by twice the voxel\nsize which is rarely sufficient to meet the good lattice assumption. The amount\nof smoothing required for Random Field Theory to produce accurate p-values\nincreases with image resolution and decreases with degrees of freedom. There is\nno rule of thumb that is valid for all study designs but for typical data (3mm\nresolution, and greater than 20 subjects) residual smoothness with FWHM = 4\ntimes voxel size should produce valid results. However, it should be stressed\nthat for higher spatial resolution and lower degrees of freedom the critical\nsmoothness required will increase sharply. This implies that researchers should\ncarefully choose appropriate smoothing kernels. This can be facilitated by the\nsimulations we provide that identify the critical smoothness at which the\napplication of RFT becomes appropriate. For some applications such as\npresurgical mapping or, imaging of small structures, probing the\nlaminar/columnar structure of the cortex these smoothness requirements may be\ntoo great to preserve spatial structure. As such, this study suggests\ndevelopments are needed in Random Field Theory to fully exploit the resolution\nof modern neuroimaging.\n"]}]

These improvements will allow for a\nmulti-$\\sigma$ detection of percent-level departures from CDM over a wide range\nof masses. Much of this improvement is driven by the effects of weak\ngravitational lensing on the CMB, which breaks degeneracies between ULAs and\nneutrinos.
