We determine bolometric light\ncurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input\nby magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque\ncircumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our\nsample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the\npossible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to\nbeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading\nsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse\nbehaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic\nparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous\nstudies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be\nviable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase\nluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid\ndrop in flux. This would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, or\nthat the X-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. The light\ncurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d after\nmaximum light. We argue that this could result either from multiple shells of\ncircumstellar material, or from a magnetar ionisation front breaking out of the\nejecta.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS (Aug 2014)"]}]

The central question that we study in this paper is:\nwhich fat graphs are systolic graphs for some surface - we call such graphs\nadmissible. This is motivated in part by the observation that we can naturally\ndecompose the moduli space of hyperbolic surfaces based on the associated\nsystolic graphs.\n  A systolic graph has a metric on it, so that all cycles on the graph that\ncorrespond to geodesics are of the same length and all other cycles have length\ngreater than these.

A galaxy and the SMBH\nare generally thought to have co-evolved. However, the SMBH cannot evolve so\nfast as commonly observed even at redshift $z>6$. Therefore SMBH must form\nfirst before galaxy. Our goal is to clarify how this mature SMBH forms galaxy.\nFurthermore we clarify the mechanism how the SMBH designs variety of structures\nof galaxies. We explore a natural hypothesis that the SMBH has been formed\nmature at $z\\approx10$ before stars and galaxies. The SMBH forms energetic jets\nand outflows which trigger massive star formation in the ambient gas. They\neventually construct globular clusters and classical bulge as well as the body\nof elliptical galaxies. We propose simple models which implement these\nprocesses along with the standard $\\Lambda$CDM-model. We point out that the\nglobular clusters and classical bulges have a common origin but are in\ndifferent phases. The same is true for the elliptical and spiral galaxies.\nPhysics behind these phase division is the runaway star formation process with\nstrong feedback to SMBH. This is similar to the forest-fire model that displays\nself-organized criticality.

The framework considers as input time incoherent 3D\nobservations of a moving shape, and is thus particularly suitable for the\noutput of performance capture platforms. In our system, a suitable virtual\nrepresentation of the actor is built from real captures that allows seamless\ncombination and simulation with virtual external forces and objects, in which\nthe original captured actor can be reshaped, disassembled or reassembled from\nuser-specified virtual physics. Instead of using the dominant surface-based\ngeometric representation of the capture, which is less suitable for volumetric\neffects, our pipeline exploits Centroidal Voronoi tessellation decompositions\nas unified volumetric representation of the real captured actor, which we show\ncan be used seamlessly as a building block for all processing stages, from\ncapture and tracking to virtual physic simulation.

To model the empirical noise of an image, our method introduces the\nmixture of Gaussian distribution, which is flexible enough to approximate\ndifferent continuous distributions. The problem of blind image denoising is\nreformulated as a learning problem. The procedure is to first build a two-layer\nstructural model for noisy patches and consider the clean ones as latent\nvariable. To control the complexity of the noisy patch model, this work\nproposes a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior called \"Dependent Dirichlet\nProcess Tree\" to build the model. Then, this study derives a variational\ninference algorithm to estimate model parameters and recover clean patches.

Data"],"description":["  We consider the problem of sequential signal detection in a multichannel\nsystem where the number and location of signals is a priori unknown. We assume\nthat the data in each channel are sequentially observed and follow a general\nnon-i.i.d. stochastic model. Under the assumption that the local log-likelihood\nratio processes in the channels converge r-completely to positive and finite\nnumbers, we establish the asymptotic optimality of a generalized sequential\nlikelihood ratio test and a mixture-based sequential likelihood ratio test.\nSpecifically, we show that both tests minimize the first r moments of the\nstopping time distribution asymptotically as the probabilities of false alarm\nand missed detection approach zero. Moreover, we show that both tests\nasymptotically minimize all moments of the stopping time distribution when the\nlocal log-likelihood ratio processes have independent increments and simply\nobey the Strong Law of Large Numbers. This extends a result previously known in\nthe case of i.i.d. observations when only one channel is affected. We\nillustrate the general detection theory using several practical examples,\nincluding the detection of signals in Gaussian hidden Markov models, white\nGaussian noises with unknown intensity, and testing of the first-order\nautoregression's correlation coefficient. Finally, we illustrate the\nfeasibility of both sequential tests when assuming an upper and a lower bound\non the number of signals and compare their non-asymptotic performance using a\nsimulation study.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 2 figures"]}]
