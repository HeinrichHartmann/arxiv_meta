By incorporating an\nevolving ionising escape fraction and a treatment for self-shielding within\nLyman limit systems, we have run the first simulations of \"photon-starved\"\nreionisation scenarios that simultaneously reproduce observations of the\nabundance of galaxies, the optical depth to electron scattering of cosmic\nmicrowave background photons \\tau, and the effective optical depth to\nLyman\\alpha absorption at z=5. We confirm that an ionising background reduces\nthe clumping factor C by more than 50% by smoothing moderately-overdense\n(\\Delta=1--100) regions. Meanwhile, outflows increase clumping only modestly.\nThe clumping factor of ionised gas is much lower than the overall baryonic\nclumping factor because the most overdense gas is self-shielded.\nPhotoionisation heating further suppresses recombinations if reionisation heats\ngas above the canonical 10,000 K. Accounting for both effects within our most\nrealistic simulation, C rises from <1 at z>10 to 3.3 at z=6. We show that\nincorporating temperature- and ionisation-corrected clumping factors into an\nanalytical reionisation model reproduces the numerical simulation's \\tau to\nwithin 10%. Finally, we explore how many ionising photons are absorbed during\nthe process of heating filaments by considering the overall photon cost of\nreionisation in analytical models that assume that the IGM is heated at\ndifferent redshifts. For reionisation redshifts of 9--10, cold filaments boost\nthe reionisation photon budget by ~1 photon per hydrogen atom.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures; accepted to MNRAS"]}]

In NIHAO simulations\n$c/a$ increases with halo mass and integrated star formation efficiency,\nreaching $\\sim 0.8$ at the Milky Way mass (compared to 0.5 in DM-only),\nproviding a plausible solution to the long-standing conflict between\nobservations and DM-only simulations. The radial profile of the phase-space $Q$\nparameter ($\\rho/\\sigma^3$) is best fit with a single power law in DM-only\nsimulations, but shows a flattening within $\\simeq 0.1R_{\\rm vir}$ for NIHAO\nfor total masses $M>10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. Finally, the global velocity\ndistribution of DM is similar in both DM-only and NIHAO simulations, but in the\nsolar neighborhood, NIHAO galaxies deviate substantially from Maxwellian. The\ndistribution is more symmetric, roughly Gaussian, with a peak that shifts to\nhigher velocities for Milky Way mass haloes. We provide the distribution\nparameters which can be used for predictions for direct DM detection\nexperiments. Our results underline the ability of the galaxy formation\nprocesses to modify the properties of dark matter haloes.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 17 figures, analysis strongly improved, main conclusions\n  unchanged, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

We show that the distortions arise from a leakage of the CMB\ndipole into the y-channel which couples to all multipoles, mostly affecting the\nrange $\\ell$ < ~400. This should be visible in Planck's y-maps with an\nestimated signal-to-noise ratio of about 12. We note however that such\nfrequency-dependent terms carry no new information on the nature of the CMB\ndipole. This implies that the real significance of Planck's Doppler coupling\nmeasurements is actually lower than reported by the collaboration. Finally, we\nquantify the level of contamination in tSZ and primordial y-type distortions\nand show that it is above the sensitivity of proposed next generation CMB\nexperiments.\n","Comment: v3: Some corrections and clarifications, including revised S/N of the\n  effect and a new figure.

In that work the zero-point\nrenormalization and the temperature dependence were obtained by sampling the\nnuclear wavefunctions using a stochastic approach. In the present work, we show\nthat the stochastic sampling can be replaced by fully deterministic supercell\ncalculations based on a single optimal configuration of the atomic positions.\nWe demonstrate that a single calculation is able to capture the\ntemperature-dependent band gap renormalization including quantum nuclear\neffects in direct and indirect-gap semiconductors, as well as phonon-assisted\noptical absorption in indirect-gap semiconductors. In order to demonstrate this\nmethodology we calculate from first principles the temperature-dependent\noptical absorption spectra and the renormalization of direct and indirect band\ngaps in Si, C, and GaAs, and we obtain good agreement with experiment and with\nprevious calculations. In this work we also establish the formal connection\nbetween the Williams-Lax theory of optical transitions and the related theories\nof indirect absorption by Hall, Bardeen, and Blatt, and of\ntemperature-dependent band structures by Allen and Heine. Furthermore, we\nidentify an additional band gap renormalization that arises in the case of\ndegenerate band extrema, and which has not been considered in previous work.\nThe present methodology enables systematic ab initio calculations of optical\nabsorption spectra at finite temperature, including both direct and indirect\ntransitions. This feature will be useful for high-throughput calculations of\noptical properties at finite temperature, and for calculating\ntemperature-dependent optical properties using high-level theories such as GW\nand Bethe-Salpeter approaches.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures"]}]

A conceptual philosophy called\nDE-STAR, which stands for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and\nexploRation, is an orbiting stand-off system, which has been described in other\npapers. This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as\na reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a\ndirected energy array that heats the surface of the target to the point of high\nsurface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an\nejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the\nobject. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses\nconventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the\nspacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation,\nthe asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest\nspacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a\nsystem of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity\ntractor.

In particular,\nchiral anomaly turns out to be the underlying mechanism for the negative\nlongitudinal magnetoresistivity in a Weyl metal phase. Existence of a\ndissipationless current channel causes enhancement of electric currents along\nthe direction of a pair of Weyl points or applied magnetic fields ($B$).\nHowever, temperature ($T$) dependence of the negative longitudinal\nmagnetoresistivity has not been understood yet in the presence of disorder\nscattering since it is not clear at all how to introduce effects of disorder\nscattering into the \"topological-in-origin\" transport coefficient at finite\ntemperatures.

We aim at providing the community with a\ncatalog of high-quality measurements of the 1.5273 micron DIB towards a large\nfraction of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)\nhot stars observed to correct for the telluric absorption and not used for ISM\nstudies so far. This catalog would complement the extensive database recently\nextracted from the APOGEE observations and used for 3D ISM mapping. We devised\na method to fit the stellar continuum of the hot calibration stars and\nextracted the DIB from the normalized spectrum. Severe selection criteria based\non the absorption characteristics are applied to the results. In particular\nlimiting constraints on the DIB widths and Doppler shifts are deduced from the\nHI 21 cm measurements, following a new technique of decomposition of the\nemission spectra. From ~16 000 available hot telluric spectra we have extracted\n~ 6700 DIB measurements and their associated uncertainties. The statistical\nproperties of the extracted absorptions are examined and our selection criteria\nare shown to provide a robust dataset. The resulting catalog contains the DIB\ntotal equivalent widths, central wavelengths and widths. We briefly illustrate\nits potential use for the stellar and interstellar communities.\n","Comment: The Astrophysical Journal Supplement, in press, 35 pages, 14 figures"]}]

In this paper, we explore\nthe effect of the arbitrary thresholds used in the GOES (Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite) event list and LYRA (Large Yield\nRAdiometer) Flare Finder algorithms. We find that there is a small but\nsignificant relationship between the power law exponent of the GOES flare peak\nflux frequency distribution and the flare start thresholds of the algorithms.\nWe also find that the power law exponents of these distributions are not\nstable, but appear to steepen with increasing peak flux. This implies that the\nobserved flare size distribution may not be a power law at all. We show that\ndepending on the true value of the exponent of the flare size distribution,\nthis deviation from a power law may be due to flares missed by the flare\ndetection algorithms. However, it is not possible determine the true exponent\nfrom GOES/XRS observations. Additionally we find that the PROBA2/LYRA flare\nsize distributions are artificially steep and clearly non-power law. We show\nthat this is consistent with an insufficient degradation correction.

We\nmeasure $\\Gamma$ of 4-8% for young, 10-100 Myr old populations in M31.

In comparison to pre-main sequence Herbig stars, these B[e] stars\nshow equally substantial excess emission in the near-infrared, indicative of\nexistence of warm dust, but much reduced excess at longer wavelengths, so the\ndusty envelopes should be compact in size.

By switching off\ndynamical friction when rt(r) = r (where rt is the tidal radius at the\nsatellite's position) we arrive at a model which reproduces the N-body results\nremarkably well. Since the tidal radius can be very large for constant density\nbackground distributions, our model recovers the result that stalling can occur\nfor Ms/Menc << 1, where Ms and Menc are the mass of the satellite and the\nenclosed galaxy mass, respectively. Finally, we include the contribution to\ndynamical friction that comes from stars moving faster than the satellite. This\nnext-to-leading order effect becomes the dominant driver of inspiral near the\ncore region, prior to stalling.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures, resubmitted to MNRAS after responding to\n  feedback from the referee"]}]

The build up of the H2\ndissociating background is slower than the X-ray background due to the\nshielding effect of resonant hydrogen Lyman lines. Hence, the nearly\nunavoidable X-ray emission from supernova remnants of Pop III stars is\nsufficient to boost their number to few tens per comoving Mpc^3 by redshift\nz~15.

Limits of a few hundred mJy/beam for narrow band emission (10 kHz) are\nderived from our data, across our 400 sq. deg. field of view. Within this\nfield, 45 exoplanets in 38 planetary systems are known. We extract spectra at\nthe locations of these systems from our image cube, to place limits on the\npresence of narrow line emission from these systems. We then derive minimum\nisotropic transmitter powers for these exoplanets; a small handful of the\nclosest objects (10s of pc) yield our best limits of order $10^{14}$ W\n(Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power: EIRP). These limits lie above the highest\npower directional transmitters near these frequencies currently operational on\nEarth.

Method: We used APEX SEPIA Band 5 to perform the observations. Results: We\ndetected 183 GHz water maser emission towards NGC 4945 with a peak flux density\nof ~3 Jy near the galactic systemic velocity. The emission spans a velocity\nrange of several hundred km/s. We estimate an isotropic luminosity of > 1000\nLsun, classifying the emission as a megamaser. A comparison of the 183 GHz\nspectrum with that observed at 22 GHz suggests that 183 GHz emission also\narises from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) central engine. If the 183 GHz\nemission originates from the circumnuclear disk, then we estimate that a\nredshifted feature at 1084 km/s in the spectrum should arise from a distance of\n0.022 pc from the supermassive black hole (1.6 x 10(5) Schwarzschild radii),\ni.e. closer than the water maser emission previously detected at 22 GHz. This\nis only the second time 183 GHz maser emission has been detected towards an AGN\ncentral engine (the other galaxy being NGC 3079).

For NGC 4945, we believe that the maser\nemission arises, or is dominated by, emission from the AGN central engine.\nEmission at higher velocity, i.e. for a Keplerian disk closer to the black\nhole, has been detected at 183 GHz compared with that for the 22 GHz megamaser.\nThis indicates that millimetre/submillimetre water masers can indeed be useful\nprobes for tracing out more of AGN central engine structures and dynamics than\npreviously probed.

In order to\ncheck whether this enhancement near the hydrogen ionization transition is\nsufficient to reproduce observed light curves, we incorporate this MRI-based\nvariation in $\\alpha$ into the Disc Instability Model, as well as\nsimulation-based models of turbulent dissipation and convective transport.\nThese MRI-based models can successfully reproduce observed outburst and\nquiescence durations, as well as outburst amplitudes, albeit with different\nparameters from the standard Disc Instability Models. The MRI-based model\nlightcurves exhibit reflares in the decay from outburst, which are not\ngenerally observed in dwarf novae. However, we highlight the problematic\naspects of the quiescence physics in the Disc Instability Model and MRI\nsimulations that are responsible for this behavior.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

However, in a heterogeneous WPT network with\ndistributed ENs and WDs, some WDs may quickly deplete their batteries due to\nthe lack of timely wireless power supply by the ENs, thus resulting in short\nnetwork operating lifetime. In this paper, we exploit frequency diversity in a\nbroadband WPT network and study the distributed charging control by ENs to\nmaximize network lifetime. In particular, we propose a practical voting-based\ndistributed charging control framework where each WD simply estimates the\nbroadband channel, casts its vote(s) for some strong sub-channel(s) and sends\nto the ENs along with its battery state information, based on which the ENs\nindependently allocate their transmit power over the sub-channels without the\nneed of centralized control. Under this framework, we aim to design\nlifetime-maximizing power allocation and efficient voting-based feedback\nmethods. Towards this end, we first derive the general expression of the\nexpected lifetime of a WPT network and draw the general design principles for\nlifetime-maximizing charging control. Based on the analysis, we then propose a\ndistributed charging control protocol with voting-based feedback, where the\npower allocated to sub-channels at each EN is a function of the weighted sum\nvote received from all WDs. Besides, the number of votes cast by a WD and the\nweight of each vote are related to its current battery state.

This graph partitioning\nalgorithm is inspired by molecules hitting the borders of air filled elastic\nballoons: an a(ge)nt that hits a border edge from the interior of its region\nmore frequently than an external a(ge)nt hits the same edge from an adjacent\nvertex in the neighboring region, may conquer that adjacent vertex, expanding\nits region at the expense of the neighbor. Since the rule of patrolling a\nregion ensures that each vertex is visited with a frequency inversely\nproportional to the size of the region, in terms of vertex count, a smaller\nregion will effectively exert higher \"pressure\" at its borders, and conquer\nadjacent vertices from a larger region, thereby increasing the smaller region\nand shrinking the larger. The algorithm, therefore, tends to equalize the sizes\nof the regions patrolled, resembling a set of perfectly elastic physical\nballoons, confined to a closed volume and filled with an equal amount of air.\nThe pheromone based local interactions of agents eventually cause the system to\nevolve into a partition that is close to balanced rather quickly, and if the\ngraph and the number of a(ge)nts remain unchanged, it is guaranteed that the\nsystem settles into a stable and balanced partition.\n","Comment: 74 pages"]}]

Since the singular values have clear meanings and should be treated\ndifferently, NNM regularizes each of them equally, which often restricts its\ncapability and flexibility. Recent advances have suggested that the weighted\nnuclear norm minimization (WNNM) has shown great potential in different image\nrestoration studies, where singular values are assigned different value.\nHowever, it still lacks a mathematical derivation why the weighted nuclear norm\nis more appropriate than the nuclear norm. In this paper, we proposed a new\nscheme for image restoration using group sparse representation via weighted\nnuclear norm minimization (GSR-WNNM).

To ensure that property, it is possible to perform an operation called\n\\emph{bootstrapping} to reduce the noise level. However, bootstrapping is\ntime-consuming and has been identified as a critical operation. This motivates\na new problem in discrete optimization, that of choosing where in the circuit\nto perform bootstrapping operations so as to control the noise level; the goal\nis to minimize the number of bootstrappings in circuits.\n  In this paper, we formally define the \\emph{bootstrap problem}, we design a\npolynomial-time $L$-approximation algorithm using a novel method of rounding of\na linear program, and we show a matching hardness result:\n$(L-\\epsilon)$-inapproximability for any $\\epsilon>0$.\n"]}]

Then we performed linear fittings to the\nabundances as a function of the de-projected galactocentric distances. The\nanalysis of the radial distribution both for O/H and N/O in the non-interacting\ngalaxies reveals that both average slopes are negative, but a non-negligible\nfraction of objects have a flat or even a positive gradient (at least 10\\% for\nO/H and 4\\% for N/O).
