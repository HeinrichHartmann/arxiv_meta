However, the cause\nand the mechanism by which such collective changes of direction occur are not\nfully understood yet.

We show that\nspontaneous turns start from individuals located at the elongated edges of the\nflocks, and then propagate through the group. We find that birds on the edges\ndeviate from the mean direction of motion much more frequently than other\nindividuals, indicating that persistent localized fluctuations are the crucial\ningredient for triggering a collective directional change. Finally, we\nquantitatively show that birds follow equal radius paths during turning\nallowing the flock to change orientation and redistribute risky locations among\ngroup members.

We demonstrate\ninterferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including\nthe largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements.\nThese wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes\nimpact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most\ndesirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a\ndipole or a phased array. Comparing data from recent Murchison Widefield Array\nobservations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have the\nlargest impact on the HI signal arise from power received far away from the\nprimary field of view. We identify diffuse emission near the horizon as a\nsignificant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usually\nrepresent structures on small scales. For signals entering through the primary\nfield of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. These\ntwo mechanisms imprint a characteristic \"pitchfork\" signature on the\n\"foreground wedge\" in Fourier delay space.

Thus, the\ndirect measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at different redshifts are\nof great importance for constraining the properties of dark energy. In this\npaper, we show how the typical dark energy models, for example, the\n$\\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, CPL, and holographic dark energy (HDE) models, can be\nconstrained by the current direct measurements of $H(z)$ (31 data in total,\ncovering the redshift range of $z\\in [0.07,2.34]$).

CVPs\nare a collection of up to $|V|$ paths between a source and a target node in a\ngraph $G = (V,E)$, computed using two shortest path trees, that have\ndistinctive properties relative to other path sets. They have been shown to be\nparticularly useful in geospatial applications, where they are an intuitive and\nefficient means for identifying a set of spatially diverse alternatives to the\nsingle shortest path between the source and target. However, spatial diversity\nis not intrinsic to paths in a graph, and little theory has been developed\noutside of application to describe the nature of these paths and the RPC method\nin general. Here we divorce the RPC method from its typical geospatial\napplications and develop a comprehensive theory of CVPs from an abstract\ngraph-theoretic perspective. Restricting ourselves to properties of the CVPs\nand of the entire set of $k$-best CVPs that can be computed in $O(|E| + |V|\n\\log |V|)$, we are able to then propose, among other things, new and efficient\napproaches to problems such as generating a diverse set of paths and to\ncomputing the $k$ shortest loopless paths between two nodes in a graph.

We assess how multilateral migratory relationships at\nglobal, regional, and local scales coexist (\"glocalization\"), divide\n(\"polarization\"), or form an interconnected global system (\"globalization\"). To\ndo this, we decompose the world migration network (WMN) into communities---sets\nof countries with denser than expected migration connections---and characterize\ntheir pattern of local (i.e., intracommunity) and global (i.e., intercommunity)\nconnectivity. We distinguish community signatures---\"cave\", \"biregional\", and\n\"bridging\"---with distinct migration patterns, spatial network structures,\ntemporal dynamics, and underlying antecedents. Cave communities are\ntightly-knit, enduring structures that tend to channel local migration between\ncontiguous countries; biregional communities are likely to merge migration\nbetween two distinct geographic regions (e.g., North Africa and Europe); and\nbridging communities have hub-and-spoke structures that tend to emerge\ndynamically from globe-spanning movements. We find that world migration is\nneither globally interconnected nor reproduces the geographic boundaries as\ndrawn on a world map but involves a heterogeneous interplay of global and local\ntendencies in different network regions. We discuss the implications of our\nresults for the understating of variability in today's transnational mobility\npatterns and migration opportunities across the globe.\n"]}]

Here, we present nano-scale measurements of three-dimensional,\nFIB-induced lattice strains, probed using Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction\nImaging (BCDI). We observe that even low gallium ion doses, typical of FIB\nimaging, cause substantial lattice distortions. At higher doses, extended\nself-organised defect structures appear, giving rise to stresses far in excess\nof the bulk yield limit.
