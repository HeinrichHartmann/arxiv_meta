The FCV encodes the large-sized convolutional maps into a fixed-length\nmid-level representation, and is demonstrated to be strongly complementary to\nthe high-level FC-features.

More\nprecisely, we consider the Yamada model with delay -- a system of three\ndelay-differential equations (DDEs) for two slow and one fast variable -- which\nhas been shown to reproduce accurately self-pulsing features as observed in\nSLSA experimentally. This model is also of broader interest because it is quite\nclosely related to mathematical models of other self-pulsing systems, such as\nexcitable spiking neurons.\n  We perform a numerical bifurcation analysis of the Yamada model with delay,\nwhere we consider both the feedback delay, the feedback strength and the\nstrength of pumping as bifurcation parameters. We find a rapidly increasing\ncomplexity of the system dynamics when the feedback delay is increased from\nzero. In particular, there are new feedback-induced dynamics: stable\nquasi-periodic oscillations on tori, as well as a large degree of\nmultistability, with up to five pulse-like stable periodic solutions with\ndifferent amplitudes and repetition rates. An attractor map in the plane of\nperturbations on the gain and intensity reveals a Cantor set-like, intermingled\nstructure of the different basins of attraction. This suggests that, in\npractice, the multistable laser is extremely sensitive to small perturbations.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 13 figures"]}]

In a post-processing step we compute the\nabundances of species at chemical equilibrium. We show that CH+ is efficiently\nformed at the edge of clumps, in regions where the H2 fraction is low, but\nnevertheless higher than its equilibrium value, and where the gas temperature\nis high. We show that warm and out of equilibrium H2 increases the integrated\ncolumn densities of CH+ by one order of magnitude, up to values still 3-10\ntimes lower than those observed in the diffuse ISM. We balance the Lorentz\nforce with the ion-neutral drag to estimate the ion-drift velocities (vd). We\nfind that the vd distribution peaks around 0.04 km s-1, and that high vd are\ntoo rare to have a significant statistical impact on the abundances of CH+.\nCompared to previous works, our multiphase simulations reduce the spread in vd,\nand our self-consistent treatment of the ionisation leads to much reduced vd.\nNevertheless, our resolution study shows that this velocity distribution is not\nconverged: the ion-neutral drift has a higher impact on CH+ at higher\nresolution.

Within these\nlimitations, we conclude that warm H2 is a key ingredient in the efficient\nformation of CH+ and that the ambipolar diffusion has very little influence on\nthe abundance of CH+, mainly due to the small drift velocities obtained.\nHowever, we point out that small-scale processes and other non-thermal\nprocesses not included in our MHD simulation may be of crucial importance, and\nhigher resolution studies with better controlled dissipation processes are\nneeded.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in section 6.

Massive grains behave as aerodynamic particles in primarily neutral\ngas, and thus are able to produce dramatic small-scale fluctuations in the\ndust-to-gas ratio.

However,\neven in primarily neutral gas in GMCs, dust grains are negatively charged and\nLorentz forces are non-negligible. Therefore, we extend our previous study by\nincluding the Lorentz forces on charged grains (in addition to drag). For small\ncharged grains (<<0.1 micron), Lorentz forces suppress dust-to-gas ratio\nfluctuations, while for large grains (~micron), Lorentz forces have essentially\nno effect, trends that are well explained with a simple theory of dust\nmagnetization. In some special intermediate cases, Lorentz forces can enhance\ndust-gas segregation. For physically expected scalings of dust charge with\ngrain size, we find the most important effects depend on grain size with\nLorentz forces/charge as a second-order correction. We show that the dynamics\nwe consider are determined by three dimensionless numbers in the limit of weak\nbackground magnetic fields: the turbulent Mach number, a dust drag parameter\n(proportional to grain size) and a dust Lorentz parameter (proportional to\ngrain charge); these allow us to generalize our simulations to a wide range of\nconditions.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

Below the Curie temperature ($T_C \\sim 94$ K) of CoCr$_2$O$_4$ we\nobserve a $\\omega \\sim 16 \\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$ $\\boldsymbol q=0$ magnon having\nT$_{1g}$-symmetry, which has the transformation properties of an axial vector.\nThe anomalously large Raman intensity of the T$_{1g}$-symmetry magnon is\ncharacteristic of materials with a large magneto-optical response and likely\narises from large magnetic fluctuations that strongly modulate the dielectric\nresponse in CoCr$_2$O$_4$. The Raman susceptibility of the T$_{1g}$-symmetry\nmagnon exhibits a strong magnetic-field dependence that is consistent with the\nmagnetodielectric response observed in CoCr$_2$O$_4$, suggesting that\nmagnetodielectric behavior in CoCr$_2$O$_4$ primarily arises from the\nfield-dependent suppression of magnetic fluctuations that are strongly coupled\nto long-wavelength phonons. Increasing the magnetic anisotropy in CoCr$_2$O$_4$\nwith applied pressure decreases the magnetic field-dependence of the\nT$_{1g}$-symmetry magnon Raman susceptibility in CoCr$_2$O$_4$, suggesting that\nstrain can be used to control the magnetodielectric response in CoCr$_2$O$_4$.\n"]}]

Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response\ndynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from\nprefrontal cortex (PFC), may play a key role. To probe the algorithms that may\nunderlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and PFC interactions\nbased on a hierarchical predictive coding framework. We propose that\nprobabilistic inference occurs in two steps. Initially, V4 responses are driven\nsolely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level\nof occlusion. After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and\nfeedback signals from the PFC; the latter reflect predictions made by PFC about\nthe visual stimulus underlying V4 activity. We find that this model captures\nkey features of V4 and PFC dynamics observed in experiments. Specifically, PFC\nresponses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are\nless sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback\nsignals from PFC underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes. Thus, our\nstudy proposes that area V4 and PFC participate in hierarchical inference, with\nfeedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.\n"]}]

For real-world networks, we\nquantify the extent of feedback scarcity by comparison with the ensemble of\ndirection-randomized networks and identify the most important feedback arcs.\nOur methods are also useful for visualizing directed networks.\n","Comment: 18 pages (main text and appendices, including 9 figures).

A database system designed according to this vision\noffers both increased productivity and high performance, instead of sacrificing\nthe former for the latter as is the case with existing, monolithic\nimplementations that are hard to maintain and extend. In this article, we\nrealize this vision in the domain of analytical query processing. We present\nLegoBase, a query engine written in the high-level language Scala. The key\ntechnique to regain efficiency is to apply generative programming: LegoBase\nperforms source-to-source compilation and optimizes the entire query engine by\nconverting the high-level Scala code to specialized, low-level C code. We show\nhow generative programming allows to easily implement a wide spectrum of\noptimizations, such as introducing data partitioning or switching from a row to\na column data layout, which are difficult to achieve with existing low-level\nquery compilers that handle only queries. We demonstrate that sufficiently\npowerful abstractions are essential for dealing with the complexity of the\noptimization effort, shielding developers from compiler internals and\ndecoupling individual optimizations from each other. We evaluate our approach\nwith the TPC-H benchmark and show that: (a) With all optimizations enabled,\nLegoBase significantly outperforms a commercial database and an existing query\ncompiler. (b) Programmers need to provide just a few hundred lines of\nhigh-level code for implementing the optimizations, instead of complicated\nlow-level code that is required by existing query compilation approaches.

We also prove\na matching $\\Omega(\\log n)$ lower bound for both problems, and an\n$\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{k}-\\frac{1}{2^{k-1}}})$ integrality gap for the more\ngeneral stretch $(2k-1)$ Thorup-Zwick distance oracle. We also consider the\nproblem of approximating the best TZ or PR approximate distance oracle\n\\emph{with outliers}, and show that more advanced techniques (SDP relaxations\nin particular) allow us to optimize even in the presence of outliers.\n","Comment: To appear in ITCS 2017"]}]
