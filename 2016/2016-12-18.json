The\ndimensions of such integral manifolds can, of course, vary from point to point\nbut more so can vary at a given point it depending upon the choice of their\nrecurrent buildup. When the system is regular and integrable then, of course,\nwe obtain the maximal integral leaves of the integral foliation. Attention is\nalso given to those integrable systems that can be integrated by quadratures\nwhich was, in the 19th century, the dream of many. However, our main interest\nresides in enhancing the Jordan-H\\\"older integration procedure so as to\nconstruct the local maximal integral manifolds that find many applications.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1511.08703"]}]
