In order to put constraints on their bispectra, a logical\nfirst step is to put these into factorized form which can be achieved via the\nrecently proposed method of polynomial basis expansion on the tetrahedral\ndomain. We investigate the viability of such an expansion for the oscillatory\nbispectra and find that one needs an increasing number of orthonormal mode\nfunctions to achieve significant correlation between the expansion and the\noriginal spectrum as a function of their frequency. To reduce the number of\nmodes required, we propose a basis consisting of Fourier functions\northonormalized on the tetrahedral domain.

Moreover, from an\nobservational perspective, the expansion has unique signatures depending on the\norientation of the oscillation due to a resonance effect between the mode\nfunctions and the original spectrum. This effect opens the possibility to\nextract informa- tion about both the frequency of the bispectrum as well as its\nshape while considering only a limited number of modes.

Different termination criteria leading to different\nestimates of the amplification factor were proposed within the parasitic model.\nTo determine the amplification factor and test which criterion is a better\npredictor of the MRI termination, we perform three-dimensional shearing-disc\nand shearing-box simula- tions of a region close to the surface of a\ndifferentially rotating proto-neutron star in non-ideal MHD with two different\nnumerical codes. We find that independently of the initial magnetic field\nstrength, the MRI channel modes can amplify the magnetic field by, at most, a\nfactor of 100. Under the conditions found in proto-neutron stars a more\nrealistic value for the mag- netic field amplification is of the order of 10.\nThis severely limits the role of the MRI channel modes as an agent amplifying\nthe magnetic field in proto-neutron stars starting from small seed fields. A\nfurther amplification should therefore rely on other physical processes, such\nas for example an MRI-driven turbulent dynamo.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Such themes are similar to those later used by particle\nphysicists. How do Einstein's physical strategy and the particle physics\nderivations compare? What energy-momentum complex(es) did he use and why? Did\nEinstein tie conservation to symmetries, and if so, to which? Einstein used an\nidentity from his assumed linear coordinate covariance x'= Mx to relate it to\nthe canonical tensor. Usually he avoided using matter Euler-Lagrange equations\nand so was not well positioned to use or reinvent the Herglotz-Mie-Born\nunderstanding that the canonical tensor was conserved due to translation\nsymmetries, a result with roots in Lagrange, Hamilton and Jacobi. Whereas Mie\nand Born were concerned about the canonical tensor's asymmetry, Einstein did\nnot need to worry because his Entwurf Lagrangian is modeled not so much on\nMaxwell's theory as on a scalar theory. As a result, it also has 3 ghosts,\nfailing a 1920s-30s a priori particle physics stability test with antecedents\nin Lagrange's and Dirichlet's stability work.\n  This critique of the Entwurf theory can be compared with Einstein's 1915\ncritique of his Entwurf theory for not admitting rotating coordinates and not\ngetting Mercury's perihelion right.\n  Particle physics also can be useful in the historiography of gravity and\nspace-time.

The LH content of the\noutgoing medium serves as a readout of the GnRH signaling pathway activation in\nthe cells. The challenge lies in relating the LH content of the medium leaving\nthe chamber to the cellular processes producing LH secretion. To investigate\nthis relation we developed and analyzed a mathematical model consisting of\ncoupled partial differential equations describing LH secretion in a perifusion\ncell culture. We match the mathematical model to three different data sets and\ngive cellular mechanisms that explain the data. Our model illustrates the\nimportance of the negative feedback in the signaling pathway and receptor\ndesensitization. We demonstrate that different LH outcomes in oxytocin and GnRH\nstimulations might originate from different receptor dynamics and\nconcentration. We ana- lyze the model to understand the influence of\nparameters, like the velocity of the medium flow or the fraction collection\ntime, on the LH outcomes. We show that slow velocities lead to high LH\noutcomes. Also, we show that fraction collection times, which do not divide the\nGnRH pulse period evenly, lead to irregularities in the data. We examine the\ninfluence of the rate of binding and dissociation of GnRH on the GnRH movement\ndown the chamber.

It\nessentially extends an approach to study suprathermal solar reactions discussed\npreviously [Phys. Rev. C 91, 028801 (2015)] and refines its predictions. The\nmodel is applied to examine in detail the slowing-down of 8.7-MeV alpha\nparticles produced in the 7Li(p,alpha)alpha reaction of the pp chain, and to\nstudy suprathermal processes in the solar CNO cycle induced by them. The\ninfluence of electron degeneracy and electron screening on suprathermal\nreactions through in-flight reaction probability and fast particle emission\nrate is clarified. In particular, these effects account for a 20% increase of\nthe 14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate at R < 0.2Rsun. This new type of correction\nis important for the suprathermal reaction like 14N(alpha,p)17O as it is\nrecognized to be capable of distorting the CNO cycle in the 95% region of the\nsolar core. In this region, normal branching 14N <-- 17O --> 18F of nuclear\nflow transforms to abnormal sequential flow 14N --> 17O --> 18F, and the\n14N(alpha,p)17O reaction rate exceeds the rate of 17O burn up through\nconventional 17O(p,alpha)14N and 17O(p,gamma)18F processes. It is shown that\nthese factors can enhance the 17O abundance in the core as compared with\nstandard estimates. For the steady state case, the abundance enhancement is\nestimated to be as high as ~ 100 in the outer core region.

The second part of this thesis presents research on superradiant\ninstabilities of scalar and Maxwell fields on an asymptotically anti-de Sitter\nbackground. For the scalar case, we introduce a charge coupling between the\nfield and the background, and show that superradiant instabilities do exist for\nall $\\ell$ modes, in higher dimensions. For the Maxwell case, we first propose\na general prescription to impose boundary conditions on the Kerr-anti-de Sitter\nspacetime, and obtain two Robin boundary conditions. Then these two conditions\nare implemented to study superradiant unstable modes and vector clouds. In\nparticular, we find that the new branch of quasinormal modes may be unstable in\na larger parameter space. Furthermore, the existence of vector clouds indicates\nthat one may find a vector hairy black hole solution for the\nEinstein-Maxwell-anti-de Sitter system at the nonlinear level, which implies\nthat, in such system, the Kerr-Newman-anti-de Sitter black hole is not a unique\nsolution.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 195 pages, defended in February 2016.

Often the measurements do not follow\na Gaussian distribution. Additionally, a model matrix with a large condition\nnumber can complicate the problem further by making it ill-posed. In this case,\nthe performance of popular estimators may deteriorate significantly. We have\ndeveloped a new estimator that is both nearly optimal in the presence of\nGaussian errors while being also robust against outliers. Furthermore, it\nobtains meaningful estimates when the problem is ill-posed through the\ninclusion of $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ regularizations. The computation of our\nestimate involves minimizing a non-convex objective function. Hence, we are not\nguaranteed to find the global minimum in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, we\npropose two algorithms that converge to a good local minimum in a reasonable\n(and adjustable) amount of time, as an approximation of the global minimum. We\nalso analyze how the introduction of the regularization term affects the\nstatistical properties of our estimator. We confirm high robustness against\noutliers and asymptotic efficiency for Gaussian distributions by deriving\nmeasures of robustness such as the influence function, sensitivity curve, bias,\nasymptotic variance, and mean square error. We verify the theoretical results\nusing numerical experiments and show that the proposed estimator outperforms\nrecently proposed methods, especially for increasing amounts of outlier\ncontamination.
