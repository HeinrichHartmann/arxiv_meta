In the fields\nof population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation\nare commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that\nthese measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow\nis common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as\nwind or water currents. Since information about levels of asymmetric gene flow\namong populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the\ndistribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not\nbe overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from\ngenetic data, complex models based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches\ngenerally need to be employed, often at great computational cost.

This approach allows the estimation of directional components of\ngenetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort,\nusing any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These\ndirectional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to\ncalculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow\npatterns.

For the simulation of corona\ndischarges where local electric fields do not change strongly in time, the time\nstep of POSS could be much larger than the CFL time step.

A proper metric of data\nfreshness at the destination is the age-of-information, which is defined as how\nold the freshest received update is since the moment this update was generated\nat the source. A logical policy is the zero-wait policy, i.e., the source\nsubmits a fresh update once the server is free, which achieves the maximum\nthroughput and the minimum average delay. Surprisingly, this zero-wait policy\ndoes not always minimize the average age. This motivates us to study how to\noptimally control the status updates to keep data fresh and to understand when\nthe zero-wait policy is optimal.

This provides a natural lattice construction for\ntopologically-massive gauge theories, which are invariant under parity and\ntime-reversal symmetry. After defining the building blocks of the doubled\ntheories, paying special attention to the realization of gauge transformations\non quantum states, we examine the dynamics in the group space of a single\ncross, which is spanned by a single link and its dual. The dynamics is governed\nby the single-cross electric Hamiltonian and admits a simple quantum mechanical\nanalogy to the problem of a charged particle moving on a discrete space\naffected by an abstract electromagnetic potential. Such a particle might\naccumulate a phase shift equivalent to an Aharonov-Bohm phase, which is\nmanifested in the doubled theory in terms of a nontrivial ground-state\ndegeneracy on a single cross. We discuss several examples of these doubled\ntheories with different gauge groups including the cyclic group\n$\\mathbb{Z}(k)\\subset U(1)$, the symmetric group $S_3\\subset O(2)$, the binary\ndihedral (or quaternion) group $\\bar{D}_2\\subset SU(2)$, and the finite group\n$\\Delta(27)\\subset SU(3)$.

This paper is\ndevoted to revealing the equivalence relation between spatial entropy and\nfractal dimension using box-counting method. Based on varied regular fractals,\nthe numerical relationship between spatial entropy and fractal dimension is\nexamined. The results show that the ratio of actual entropy (Mq) to the maximum\nentropy (Mmax) equals the ratio of actual dimension (Dq) to the maximum\ndimension (Dmax), that is, Mq/Mmax=Dq/Dmax.

This is not possible with\nunderactuated hands, which cannot be guaranteed to avoid contact, and in fact\nexploit contacts with the object during grasping, so as to reach an equilibrium\nstate in which the object is held securely. Unfortunately, these contact\ninteractions are i) not directly controllable, and ii) hard to monitor during a\nreal grasp. We overcome these problems so as to permit learning of\ntransferrable grasps for underactuated hands. We make two main technical\ninnovations. First, we model contact interactions during the grasp implicitly.\nWe do this by modelling motor commands that lead reliably to the equilibrium\nstate, rather than modelling contact changes themselves. This alters our\nreach-to-grasp model. Second, we extend our contact model learning algorithm to\nwork with multiple training examples for each grasp type. This requires the\nability to learn which parts of the hand reliably interact with the object\nduring a particular grasp. Our approach learns from a rigid body simulation.\nThis enables us to learn how to approach the object and close the underactuated\nhand from a variety of poses. From nine training grasps on three objects the\nmethod transferred grasps to previously unseen, novel objects, that differ\nsignificantly from the training objects, with an 80% success rate.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures"]}]

First, the mathematical\ntheory of tensor operators for a Lie group is recast in a new way which is used\nto generalise the Wigner-Eckart theorem to non-compact groups. The result\nrelies on the knowledge of the recoupling theory between finite-dimensional and\ninfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of the group; here the\npreviously unconsidered cases of the 3D and 4D Lorentz groups are investigated\nin detail. As an application, the Wigner-Eckart theorem is used to generalise\nthe Jordan-Schwinger representation of SU(2) to both groups, for all\nrepresentation classes. Next, the results obtained for the 3D Lorentz group are\napplied to (2+1) Lorentzian loop quantum gravity to develop an analogue of the\nwell-known spinorial approach used in the Euclidean case. Tensor operators are\nused to construct observables and to generalise the Hamiltonian constraint\nintroduced by Bonzom and Livine (2012) for 3D gravity to the Lorentzian case.\nThe Ponzano-Regge amplitude is shown to be a solution of this constraint by\nrecovering the (opportunely generalised) Biedenharn-Elliott relations. Finally,\nthe focus is shifted on the intertwiner space based on SU(2) representations,\nwidely used in loop quantum gravity. When working in the spinorial formalism,\nit has been shown that the Hilbert space of n-valent intertwiners with fixed\ntotal area is a representation of U(n). Here it is shown that the full space of\nall n-valent intertwiners forms an irreducible representation of the\nnon-compact group SO*(2n). This fact is used to construct a new kind of\ncoherent intertwiner state (in the sense of Perelomov). Hints of how these\ncoherent states can be interpreted in the semi-classical limit as convex\npolyhedra are provided.\n","Comment: PhD thesis.

However, the \\textit{self-healing} ability emerges as a valuable\nopportunity where the overlaying cyber network can cure failures in the\nunderlying physical network. To capture both self-healing and contagion, this\npaper considers a graphical model representation of an interdependent\ncyber-physical system, in which nodes represent various cyber or physical\nfunctionalities, and edges capture the interactions between the nodes. A\nmessage-passing algorithm used in low-density parity-check codes is extended to\nthis representation to study the dynamics of failure propagation and healing.\nBy applying a density evolution analysis to this algorithm, network reaction to\ninitial disruptions is investigated. It is proved that as the number of\nmessage-passing iterations increases, the network reaches a steady-state\ncondition that would be either a complete healing or a complete collapse. Then,\na sufficient condition is derived to select the network parameters to guarantee\nthe complete healing of the system. The result of the density evolution\nanalysis is further employed to jointly optimize the design of cyber and\nphysical networks for maximum resiliency. This analytical framework is then\nextended to the cases where propagation of failures in the physical network is\nfaster than the healing responses of the cyber network. Such scenarios are of\ninterest in many real-life applications such as smart grid.

We\nemploy general adaptive moments (GLAM) to study causes of shear bias on a\nfundamental level and for a practical definition of an image ellipticity. For\nGLAM, the ellipticity is identical to that of isophotes of elliptical images,\nand this ellipticity is always an unbiased estimator of reduced shear. Our\ntheoretical framework reiterates that moment-based techniques are similar to a\nmodel-based approach in the sense that they fit an elliptical profile to the\nimage to obtain weighted moments. As a result, moment-based estimates of\nellipticities are prone to underfitting bias. The estimation is fundamentally\nlimited mainly by pixellation which destroys information on the original,\npre-seeing image. We give an optimized estimator for the pre-seeing GLAM\nellipticity and its bias for noise-free images. To deal with images where pixel\nnoise is prominent, we consider a likelihood model of GLAM parameters in the\npre-seeing frame. Similar to the noise-free case, this likelihood is biased in\nthe presence of underfitting. The bias does not vary with the overall noise\nlevel but it depends in detail on the correlation of pixel noise as well as the\nnoise homogeneity over the image, which could be relevant for the calibration\nstrategies of other methodologies. We give an analytic expression for the\nunderfitting bias and suggest means to reduce it. Moreover, within a Bayesian\nframework of the GLAM ellipticity, noise-dependent bias emerges after\nmarginalisation of the likelihood over image size or centroid position, even in\nthe absence of underfitting. Therefore, a Bayesian approach to shape\nmeasurements does not necessarily mitigate noise bias although our tests show\nthat it can be reduced.

As detectors 32 poly-crystalline (pCVD) diamond sensors are\npositioned in rings around the beam pipe.

The reason why in real experiments the CCE is much worse than in\nlaboratory experiments is related to the ionization rate. At high particle\nrates the trapping rate of the ionization is so high compared with the\ndetrapping rate, that space charge builds up. This space charge reduces locally\nthe internal electric field, which in turn increases the trapping rate and\nrecombination and hence reduces the CCE in a strongly non-linear way. A diamond\nirradiation campaign was started to investigate the rate dependent electrical\nfield deformation with respect to the radiation damage.

The quantum\ngas microscope has been used to directly measure magnetic order, dynamic\ncorrelations, Pauli blocking, and many other physical phenomena in several\nrecent groundbreaking experiments. However, the analysis of the data from a\nquantum gas microscope can be pushed much further, and when used in conjunction\nwith theoretical constructs it is possible to measure virtually any observable\nof interest in a wide range of systems. We focus on how to measure quantum\nentanglement in large interacting quantum systems. In particular, we show that\nquantum gas microscopes can be used to measure the entanglement of interacting\nboson systems exactly, where previously it had been thought this was only\npossible for non-interacting systems. We consider algorithms that can work for\nlarge experimental data sets which are similar to theoretical variational Monte\nCarlo techniques, and more data limited sets using properties of correlation\nfunctions.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The act of measuring and removing the effect of lensing\nfrom CMB maps, or delensing, has been well studied in the context of $B$ modes,\nbut little attention has been given to the delensing of the temperature and $E$\nmodes. In this paper, we model the expected delensed $T$ and $E$ power spectra\nto all orders in the lensing potential, demonstrating the sharpening of the\nacoustic peaks and a significant reduction in lens-induced power spectrum\ncovariances. We then perform cosmological forecasts, demonstrating that\ndelensing will yield improved sensitivity to parameters with upcoming surveys.\nWe highlight the breaking of the degeneracy between the effective number of\nneutrino species and primordial helium fraction as a concrete application. We\nalso show that delensing increases cosmological information as long as the\nmeasured lensing reconstruction is included in the analysis. We conclude that\nwith future data, delensing will be crucial not only for primordial $B$-mode\nscience but for a range of other observables as well.\n","Comment: To be submitted to JCAP.
