The spectrum consists of an ordered set of strictly positive\neigenvalues which naturally splits into non-overlapping, orbitally labelled\n$E_{(k,l)}$ series.

Our aim is to compare results based on this\nasymptotic relation with those derived from an empirical approach for three\npulsating red-giant stars. We developed a data-driven method to perform\nfrequency extraction and mode identification. Next, we used the identified\ndipole mixed modes to determine the gravity-mode period spacing by means of an\nempirical method and by means of the asymptotic relation. In our methodology,\nwe consider the phase offset, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{g}}$, of the asymptotic\nrelation as a free parameter. Using the frequencies of the identified dipole\nmixed modes for each star in the sample, we derived a value for the\ngravity-mode period spacing using the two different methods. These differ by\nless than 5%. The average precision we achieved for the period spacing derived\nfrom the asymptotic relation is better than 1%, while that of our data-driven\napproach is 3%.

At the interface between NiO and Fe$_3$O$_4$ we\nfind the Ni to be in a divalent valence state, with unambiguous spectral\nfeatures in the Ni 2p core level x-ray photoelectron spectra typical for NiO.\nThe formation of a significant NiFe$_2$O$_4$ interlayer can be excluded by\nmeans of XMCD. Magneto optical Kerr effect measurements reveal significant\nhigher coercive fields compared to magnetite thin films grown on MgO(001), and\na 45$^{\\circ}$ rotated magnetic easy axis.

The input to the problems consists of $n$ - the size of the network, $B$\n- the node buffer sizes, $c$ - the links capacities, and a set of\nsource-destination packet requests with a release times. A solution for this\nproblem is a schedule that delivers packets to their destination without\nviolating the capacity constraints of the network (buffers or edges). Our goal\nis to design an algorithm that computes a schedule that maximizes the number of\npackets that arrive to their destination.\n  We present a randomized approximation algorithm with constant approximation\nratio in expectation for the case where the buffer-size to link-capacity ratio\n$B/c$ is constant.

Here we report on the serendipitous discovery of 20 Li-rich\ngiants observed during the Gaia-ESO Survey, which includes the first nine\nLi-rich giant stars known towards the CoRoT fields. Most of our Li-rich giants\nhave near-solar metallicities, and stellar parameters consistent with being\nbefore the luminosity bump. This is difficult to reconcile with deep mixing\nmodels proposed to explain lithium enrichment, because these models can only\noperate at later evolutionary stages: at or past the luminosity bump. In an\neffort to shed light on the Li-rich phenomenon, we highlight recent evidence of\nthe tidal destruction of close-in hot Jupiters at the sub-giant phase. We note\nthat when coupled with models of planet accretion, the observed destruction of\nhot Jupiters actually predicts the existence of Li-rich giant stars, and\nsuggests Li-rich stars should be found early on the giant branch and occur more\nfrequently with increasing metallicity. A comprehensive review of all known\nLi-rich giant stars reveals that this scenario is consistent with the data.\nHowever more evolved or metal-poor stars are less likely to host close-in giant\nplanets, implying that their Li-rich origin requires an alternative\nexplanation, likely related to mixing scenarios rather than external phenomena.\n","Comment: Accepted to MNRAS"]}]

Following a topological approach we\nintroduce cycles of varying length and analyze how this feature, as well as the\nposition in the network, alters the synchronous behaviour.

We simulate dynamical systems on these network topologies, with the\nnodes' local dynamics being either a discrete or continuous.

Aims: Our\nmain aim is to determine carbon-to-nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios for\nevolved giants in the open clusters Collinder 261 and Melotte 66 and to compare\nthe results with predictions of theoretical models. Methods: High-resolution\nspectra were analysed using a differential model atmosphere method. Abundances\nof carbon were derived using the C_2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5 A. The\nwavelength interval 7940-8130 A, which contains CN features, was analysed to\ndetermine nitrogen abundances and carbon isotope ratios. The oxygen abundances\nwere determined from the [O_I] line at 6300 A. Results: The mean values of the\nelemental abundances in Collinder 261, as determined from seven stars, are:\n[C/Fe]=-0.23 +- 0.02 (s.d.), [N/Fe]=0.18 +- 0.09, [O/Fe]=-0.03 +- 0.07. The\nmean 12^C/13^C ratio is 11 +- 2, considering four red clump stars and 18 for\none star above the clump. The mean C/N ratios are 1.60 +- 0.30 and 1.74,\nrespectively. For the five stars in Melotte 66 we obtained: [C/Fe]=-0.21 +-\n0.07 (s.d.), [N/Fe]=0.17 +- 0.07, [O/Fe]=0.16 +- 0.04. The 12^C/13^C and C/N\nratios are 8 +- 2 and 1.67 +- 0.21, respectively. Conclusions: The 12^C/13^C\nand C/N ratios of stars in the investigated open clusters were compared with\nthe ratios predicted by stellar evolution models. The mean values of 12^C/13^C\nratios in Collinder 261 and Melotte 66 agree well with models of\nthermohaline-induced extra-mixing for the corresponding stellar turn-off masses\nof about 1.1 - 1.2 Msun.

However, the analogous RV curves from theoretical line\nprofiles indicate that the distortion in the lines causes the fitted value of\n$e$ to depend on the argument of periastron; i.e., on the epoch of observation.\nAs a result, the actual value of $e$ may be as high as 0.125.

In this work, we present a compact and mobile experiment, which we\nrecently used to achieve the first inertial measurements with an atomic\naccelerometer onboard an aircraft. By integrating classical inertial sensors\ninto our apparatus, we are able to operate the atomic sensor well beyond its\nstandard operating range, corresponding to half of an interference fringe. We\nreport atom-based acceleration measurements along both the horizontal and\nvertical axes of the aircraft with one-shot sensitivities of $2.3 \\times\n10^{-4}\\,g$ over a range of $\\sim 0.1\\,g$. The same technology can be used to\ndevelop cold-atom gyroscopes, which could surpass the best optical gyroscopes\nin terms of long-term sensitivity. Our apparatus was also designed to study\nmulti-axis atom interferometry with the goal of realizing a full inertial\nmeasurement unit comprised of the three axes of acceleration and rotation.\nFinally, we present a compact and tunable laser system, which constitutes an\nessential part of any cold-atom-based sensor. The architecture of the laser is\nbased on phase modulating a single fiber-optic laser diode, and can be tuned\nover a range of 1 GHz in less than 200 $\\mu$s.\n","Comment: 14 pages + references, 8 figures"]}]

A\nstatistically significant correlation between the Eddington ratio,\n{\\lambda}$_{Edd}$, and the X-ray power-law index, {\\Gamma}, observed in\nunobscured AGN offers an estimate of their growth rate from X-ray spectroscopy\n(albeit with large scatter).

We compile results on X-ray spectral fitting of these sources with\nsensitive high-energy (E> 10 keV) NuSTAR data, where X-ray torus models which\ntake into account the reprocessing effects have been used to recover the\nintrinsic {\\Gamma} values and X-ray luminosities, L$_X$.
