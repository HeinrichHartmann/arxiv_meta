This causes\nproblems such as illegal copy and fake ownership. Watermarking is proposed as\none of the solutions to such cases. Among different watermarking techniques,\nthe wavelet transform has been used more because of its good ability in\nmodeling the human visual system. Recently, Shearlet transform as an extension\nof Wavelet transform which is based on multi-resolution and multi-directional\nanalysis is introduced. The most important feature of this transform is the\nappropriate representation of image edges. In this paper a hybrid scheme using\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Discrete Shearlet Transform (DST) is\npresented. In this way, the host image is decomposed using DWT, and then its\nlow frequency sub-band is decomposed by DST. After that, the bidiagonal\nsingular value decomposition (BSVD) is applied on the selected sub-band from\nShearlet transform and the gray-scale watermark image is embedded into its\nbidiagonal singular values. The proposed method is examined on the images with\ndifferent textures and resistance is evaluated against various attacks like\nimage processing and geometric attacks. The results show good transparency and\nhigh robustness in proposed method.\n"]}]
