Starting from the solution for a square cross-section\n(isotropic), they employ numerical continuation in the cross-sectional aspect\nratio in order to approach the solution for a thin strip. Certain smoothly\nvarying configurations are obtained.

Kosaki's\ncounterexample shows that the decomposition is not unique in general, the\ncomplete characterization of uniqueness is still not known.\n  Using the famous operator-decomposition of T. Ando, we give a necessary and\nsufficient condition for uniqueness in the particular case when the underlying\nalgebra is $B(H)$, the $C^*$-algebra of all continuous linear operators on a\nHilbert space $H$. Namely, given a normal state $f$, the $f$-Lebesgue\ndecomposition of any other normal state is unique if and only if the\nrepresenting trace class operator of $f$ has finite rank.\n  Some recent results tell that the decomposition is unique over a large class\nof commutative algebras. Our characterization demonstrates that the lack of\ncommutativity is not the real cause of non-uniqueness.\n","Comment: This manuscript has not been published and is not submitted for\n  publication.

Purpose: We want\nto investigate the influence of SRCs on the one-nucleon (1N) and two-nucleon\n(2N) knockout channel for muon-neutrino induced processes on a $^{12}$C target\nat energies relevant for contemporary measurements. Method: The model adopted\nin this work, corrects the impulse approximation for SRCs by shifting the com-\nplexity induced by the SRCs from the wave functions to the operators.

Commonly\nused methods typically find the local features for each segment and label them\nusing classifiers. Afterward, labeling is smoothed in order to make sure that\nneighboring regions receive similar labels. However, they ignore expressive and\nnon-local dependencies among regions due to expensive training and inference.\nIn this paper, we propose to use high-level knowledge regarding rules in the\ninference to incorporate dependencies among regions in the image to improve\nscores of classification. Towards this aim, we extract these rules from data\nand transform them into constraints for Integer Programming to optimize the\nstructured problem of assigning labels to super-pixels (consequently pixels) of\nan image. In addition, we propose to use soft-constraints in some scenarios,\nallowing violating the constraint by imposing a penalty, to make the model more\nflexible. We assessed our approach on three datasets and obtained promising\nresults.\n"]}]

Few of\nthese features are yet conclusively tied to objects embedded in the disks,\nperhaps because of shortcomings in our understanding of what a disk interacting\nwith a planet looks like at the wavelengths we observe. We approach these\nissues noting that even small features on the disk's surface cast shadows,\nbecause the starlight grazes the surface at low angles. We therefore focus on\naccurately computing the disk's thickness, and thus its temperature. The\nembedded planet has 20, 100, or 1000~M$_\\oplus$, ranging from barely enough to\nperturb the disk gas surface density significantly, to able to clear a deep\ntidal gap. We compare models that are in hydrostatic equilibrium in the\nvertical direction to models where the disk pressure scale height varies as a\npower of the orbital radius. The hydrostatic balance makes a large difference\nto the disk's temperature and appearance. The planet-carved gap's outer wall\npuffs up, throwing a shadow across the disk beyond. The shadow appears in\nscattered light as an additional dark ring, which could be mistaken for a gap\nopened by another more distant planet. The shadow is so deep it largely hides\nthe outer arm of the spiral wave launched by the planet. The massive planets\nyield temperature gradients such that additional more distant low-mass planets\nundergoing orbital migration will converge on a location within the shadow.\nFurthermore the temperature perturbations affect the shape, size and contrast\nof the features predicted at millimeter and centimeter wavelengths.

Since the likelihood of a finite mixture model can grow\nunboundedly by centering a Gaussian on a single datapoint and shrinking the\ncovariance, we constrain the problem by assuming that the parameters of the\nindividual models are members of a large discrete set (e.g. estimating a\nmixture of two Gaussians where the means and variances of both Gaussians are\nmembers of a set of a million possible means and variances). For this setting\nwe show that a simple upper bound on the likelihood can be computed using\nconvex optimization and we analyze conditions under which the bound is\nguaranteed to be tight. This bound can then be used to assess the quality of\nsolutions found by EM (where the final result is projected on the discrete set)\nor any other mixture estimation algorithm. For any dataset our method allows us\nto find a finite mixture model together with a dataset-specific bound on how\nfar the likelihood of this mixture is from the global optimum of the likelihood\n","Comment: icpr 2016"]}]

A\nmetallic line velocity gradient, {\\delta}v$_r$ (t), is computed as the\ndifference between weak and strong-line RVs. CCF shape indicators BIS\n(asymmetry), FWHM, and depth all exhibit clear phase-dependent variability\npatterns that differ from one pulsation cycle to the next. Weak-line CCFs\nexhibit these effects more clearly than strong-line CCFs. BIS exhibits the most\npeculiar modulated variability and can be used to identify the presence of\ncycle-to-cycle modulated line profile variations. {\\delta}v$_r$ (t) clearly\nexhibits cycle-to-cycle differences that correlate very closely with modulated\nBIS variability, suggesting perturbations of the atmospheric velocity field as\nthe cause for modulated spectral line variability. These perturbations are most\nsignificant during contraction and are not in phase with the pulsation,\ntransmitting information between consecutive pulsation cycles. This work shows\nRV curve modulation to be a consequence of atmospheric velocity gradient\nperturbations. Possible origins of these perturbations and their impact on\nCepheid RV measurements as well as the projection factor used in\nBaade-Wesselink-type distance determinations are discussed.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, MNRAS accepted"]}]
