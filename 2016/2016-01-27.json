In previous papers we used the Boltzmann moment equations\n(BME) up to second order for our studies of the velocity structure in\nself-gravitating stellar disks. A key assumption of our BME approach is the\nzero-heat flux approximation, i.e. the neglection of third order velocity\nterms. We tested this assumption by performing test particle simulations for\nstars in a disk galaxy subject to a rotating spiral perturbation. As a result\nwe corroborated qualitatively the complex velocity structure found in the BME\napproach. It turned out that an equilibrium configuration in velocity space is\nonly slowly established on a typical timescale of 5 Gyrs or more. Since many\ndynamical processes in galaxies (like the growth of spirals or bars)act on\nshorter timescales, pure equilibrium models might not be fully appropriate for\na detailed comparison with observations like the local Galactic velocity\ndistribution. Third order velocity moments were typically small and\nuncorrelated over almost all of the disk with the exception of the 4:1\nresonance region (UHR).

Recently, several groups reported\nexperimental data suggesting that signatures of Majorana modes in topological\ninsulator Josephson junctions (TIJJs) have -- indeed -- been observed. To\nverify this claim, one needs to study the topological properties of low-energy\nAndreev-bound states (ABS) in TIs of which the Majorana modes are a special\ncase. It has been shown theoretically that topologically non-trivial low-energy\nABS are also present in TIJJs with doped topological insulators up to some\ncritical level of doping at which the system undergoes a topological phase\ntransition. Here, we present first experimental evidence for this topological\ntransition in the bulk band of a doped TI. Our theoretical calculations, and\nnumerical modeling link abrupt changes in the critical current of top-gated\nTIJJs to moving the chemical potential in the charge-accumulation region on the\nsurface of the doped TI across a band-inversion point. We demonstrate that the\ncritical-current changes originate from a shift of the spatial location of\nlow-energy ABS from the surface to the boundary between topologically-trivial\nand band-inverted regions after the transition. The appearance of a decay\nchannel for surface ABS is related to the vanishing of the band effective mass\nin the bulk and thus exemplifies the topological character of surface ABS as\nboundary modes.

Decreasing \\Delta_EIT,\nhowever, increases the response time of the effect, suggesting that for pulses\nof a given duration, there could be a fundamental limit to the strength of the\nnonlinearity. We show that in the regimes of most practical interest - narrow\nEIT windows perturbed by short signal pulses- the enhancement offered by EIT is\nnot only in the magnitude of the nonlinear phase shift but in fact also in its\nincreased duration. That is, for the case of signal pulses much shorter\n(temporally) than the inverse EIT bandwidth, the narrow window serves to\nprolong the effect of the passing signal pulse, leading to an integrated phase\nshift that grows linearly with \\Delta_EIT even though the peak phase shift may\nsaturate; the continued growth of the integrated phase shift improves the\ndetectability of the phase shift, in principle without bound.

In\neach case, we embed the Regge Cauchy surfaces into 3-spheres in $\\mathbf{E}^4$\nand consider possible measures of Cauchy surface radius that can be derived\nfrom the embedding. Regge equations are obtained from both global variation,\nwhere entire sets of identical edges get varied simultaneously, and local\nvariation, where each edge gets varied individually. We explore the\nrelationship between the two sets of solutions, the conditions under which the\nRegge Hamiltonian constraint would be a first integral of the evolution\nequation, the initial value equation for each model at its moment of time\nsymmetry, and the performance of the various models. It is revealed that local\nvariation does not generally lead to a viable Regge model. It is also\ndemonstrated that the various models do satisfy their respective initial value\nequations. Finally, it is shown that the models reproduce the behaviour of the\ncontinuum model rather well initially, with performance improving as we\nincrease the number of tetrahedra used to construct the Regge Cauchy surface.\nEventually though, all models gradually fail to keep up with the continuum FLRW\nmodel's expansion, with the models with lower numbers of tetrahedra falling\naway more quickly. We believe this failure to keep up is due to the finite\nresolution of the Regge Cauchy surfaces trying to approximate an ever expanding\ncontinuum Cauchy surface; each Regge surface has a fixed number of tetrahedra\nand as the surface being approximated gets larger, the resolution would\ndegrade. Finally, we note that all Regge models end abruptly at a point when\nthe time-like struts of the skeleton become null, though this end-point appears\nto get delayed as the number of tetrahedra is increased.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 16 figures.

Instead it is better to focus on the structure of the algebra of\nobservables, and in particular on its subalgebras corresponding to regions.\nThis paper suggests that study of analogous algebraic structure in gravity\ngives an important perspective on the nature of the quantum theory. Significant\ndepartures from the subalgebra structure of local quantum field theory are\nfound, working in the correspondence limit of long-distances/low-energies.\nParticularly, there are obstacles to identifying commuting algebras of\nlocalized operators. In addition to suggesting important properties of the\nalgebraic structure, this and related observations pose challenges to proposals\nof a fundamental role for entanglement.\n","Comment: 24 pages, harvmac. v2: added refs"]}]

Recent results concerning the convergence of\nthe statistical properties of finite state Markov approximation of the full\nasymptotic dynamics on the SRB measure in the limit of finer and finer\npartitions of the phase space are suggestive of some degree of robustness of\nthe obtained results in the case of Axiom A system.

We\nintroduce a frame of vector fields adapted to the hyperboloidal foliation and\nwe establish several key properties: Sobolev and Hardy-type inequalities on\nhyperboloids, as well as sup-norm estimates which correspond to the sharp time\ndecay for the wave and the Klein-Gordon equations. These estimates allow us to\ncontrol interaction terms associated with the curved geometry and the massive\nfield, by distinguishing between two levels of regularity and energy growth and\nby a successive use of our key estimates in order to close a bootstrap\nargument.\n","Comment: 51 pages"]}]

Several competing scenarios have been\nproposed to explain such occurrences, including various jet plasma\ninstabilities leading to the formation of shocks, magnetic reconnection sites,\nand turbulence. In this letter we present the results of our detailed\ninvestigation of a prominent, five-hour-long optical microflare detected during\nrecent WEBT campaign in 2014, March 2-6 targeting the blazar 0716+714. After\nseparating the flaring component from the underlying base emission continuum of\nthe blazar, we find that the microflare is highly polarized, with the\npolarization degree $\\sim (40-60)\\%$$\\pm (2-10)\\%$, and the electric vector\nposition angle $\\sim (10 - 20)$deg$\\pm (1-8)$deg slightly misaligned with\nrespect to the position angle of the radio jet.

It is generally accepted that these jets are powered\nelectromagnetically, by the magnetised rotation of a central compact object.\nHowever, how they produce the observed emission and survive the propagation for\nmany orders of magnitude in distance without being disrupted by current-driven\nnon-axisymmetric instabilities is the subject of active debate. We carry out\ntime-dependent 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic,\nPoynting flux dominated jets. The jets are launched self-consistently by the\nrotation of a strongly magnetised central compact object. This determines the\nnatural degree of azimuthal magnetic field winding, a crucial factor that\ncontrols jet stability. We find that the jets are susceptible to two types of\ninstability: (i) a global, external kink mode that grows on long time scales\nand causes the jets to bodily bend sideways. Whereas this mode does not cause\njet disruption over the simulated distances, it substantially reduces jet\npropagation speed. We show, via an analytic model, that the growth of the\nexternal kink mode depends on the slope of the ambient medium density profile.\nIn flat density distributions characteristic of galactic cores, an AGN jet may\nstall, whereas in stellar envelopes the external kink weakens as the jet\npropagates outward; (ii) a local, internal kink mode that grows over short time\nscales and causes small-angle magnetic reconnection and conversion of about\nhalf of jet electromagnetic energy flux into heat. Based on the robustness and\nenergetics of the internal kink mode, we suggest that this instability is the\nmain dissipation mechanism responsible for powering GRB prompt emission.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 17 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

The\nprimary motivation is to properly characterize the monopole and dipole\nmodulations of the primordial power spectrum that are generated by the coupling\nbetween superhorizon and subhorizon perturbations. Unlike previous proposals\nfor generating the hemispherical power asymmetry, we do not assume that the\npower asymmetry results from a single large superhorizon mode. Instead, we\nextrapolate the observed power spectrum to superhorizon scales and compute the\npower asymmetry that would result from a specific realization of non-Gaussian\nperturbations on scales larger than the observable universe. Our study\nencompasses many of the scenarios that have been put forward as possible\nexplanations for the CMB hemispherical power asymmetry.

For small $r\\simeq0$, when the\nconfiguration is nearly homogeneous, the particle subdiffuses with an exponent\nof 2/3, similar to the diffusion of a macromolecule in a crowded environment.\nAlso, the particle's trajectory has a fractal dimension of $d_f\\simeq4/3$,\ncomparable to that of a self-avoiding walk. As the ratio increases to $r\\simeq\n1$, the particle's dynamics transitions from subdiffusion to anomalous\ndiffusion with a fractal dimension of $d_f\\simeq 7/4$, similar to that of a\npercolating cluster in 2-d. In RP configurations, which are more structured\nthan CR configurations but also randomly generated, we find that the particle\nhas the same statistic as in the CR case. In contrast, CP configurations, which\nare highly structured, typically will cause the particle to go through a\ntransient stage of subdiffusion, which then abruptly changes to propagation.\nInterestingly, the subdiffusive stage has an exponent of approximately 2/3 and\na fractal dimension of $d_f\\simeq4/3$, similar to the case of CR and RP\nconfigurations for small $r$.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Applying the technique of solar\nmagneto-seismology (SMS) allows us to infer the background properties of these\nstructures. Here, we aim to identify properties of the observed\nmagneto-acoustic waves and study the background properties of magnetic\nstructures within the lower solar atmosphere. Using the Dutch Open Telescope\n(DOT) and Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instruments, we\ncaptured two series of high-resolution intensity images with short cadence of\ntwo isolated magnetic pores. Combining wavelet analysis and empirical mode\ndecomposition (EMD), we determined characteristic periods within the\ncross-sectional (i.e., area) and intensity time series. Then, by applying the\ntheory of linear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we identified the mode of these\noscillations within the MHD framework. Several oscillations have been detected\nwithin these two magnetic pores. Their periods range from 3 to 20 minutes.\nCombining wavelet analysis and EMD enables us to confidently find the phase\ndifference between the area and intensity oscillations. From these observed\nfeatures, we concluded that the detected oscillations can be classified as slow\nsausage MHD waves. Further, we determined several key properties of these\noscillations such as the radial velocity perturbation, magnetic field\nperturbation and vertical wavenumber using solar magnetoseismology. The\nestimated range of the related wavenumbers reveals that these oscillations are\ntrapped within these magnetic structures. Our results suggest that the detected\noscillations are standing harmonics, and, this allows us to estimate the\nexpansion factor of the waveguides by employing SMS. The calculated expansion\nfactor ranges from 4-12.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures. Accepted into ApJ"]}]

Another possible signature of these CMSSM-like models is direct\ndetection of supersymmetric dark matter.

In\n2008 August, Fermi/LAT detected the blazar PKS 1502+106 showing a rapid and\nstrong gamma-ray outburst followed by high and variable flux over the next\nmonths. This activity at high energies triggered an intensive multi-wavelength\ncampaign covering also the radio, optical, UV, and X-ray bands indicating that\nthe flare was accompanied by a simultaneous outburst at optical/UV/X-rays and a\ndelayed outburst at radio bands.\n  Aims: In the current work we explore the phenomenology and physical\nconditions within the ultra-relativistic jet of the gamma-ray blazar PKS\n1502+106. Additionally, we address the question of the spatial localization of\nthe MeV/GeV-emitting region of the source.\n  Methods: We utilize ultra-high angular resolution mm-VLBI observations at 43\nand 86 GHz complemented by VLBI observations at 15 GHz. We also employ\nsingle-dish radio data from the F-GAMMA program at frequencies matching the\nVLBI monitoring.\n  Results: PKS 1502+106 shows a compact core-jet morphology and fast\nsuperluminal motion with apparent speeds in the range 5--22 c. Estimation of\nDoppler factors along the jet yield values between ~7 up to ~50. This Doppler\nfactor gradient implies an accelerating jet. The viewing angle towards the\nsource differs between the inner and outer jet, with the former at ~3 degrees\nand the latter at ~1 degree, after the jet bends towards the observer beyond 1\nmas. The de-projected opening angle of the ultra-fast, magnetically-dominated\njet is found to be (3.8 +/- 0.5) degrees. A single jet component can be\nassociated with the pronounced flare both at high-energies and in radio bands.\nFinally, the gamma-ray emission region is localized at less than 5.9 pc away\nfrom the jet base.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 12 figures.

The Gaia project will determine positions, proper motions, and\nparallaxes for more than one billion stars in our Galaxy. It is known that\nGaia's two telescopes are affected by a small but significant variation of the\nbasic angle between them. Unless this variation is taken into account during\ndata processing, e.g. using on-board metrology, it causes systematic errors in\nthe astrometric parameters, in particular a shift of the parallax zero-point.\nPreviously, we suggested an early reduction of Gaia data for the subset of\nTycho-2 stars (Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution; TGAS).\n  Aims. We aim to investigate whether quasars can be used to independently\nverify the parallax zero-point already in early data reductions. This is not\ntrivially possible as the observation interval is too short to disentangle\nparallax and proper motion for the quasar subset.\n  Methods. We repeat TGAS simulations but additionally include simulated Gaia\nobservations of quasars from ground-based surveys. All observations are\nsimulated with basic angle variations. To obtain a full astrometric solution\nfor the quasars in TGAS we explore the use of prior information for their\nproper motions.\n  Results. It is possible to determine the parallax zero-point for the quasars\nwith a few {\\mu}as uncertainty, and it agrees to a similar precision with the\nzero-point for the Tycho-2 stars. The proposed strategy is robust even for\nquasars exhibiting significant fictitious proper motion due to a variable\nsource structure, or when the quasar subset is contaminated with stars\nmisidentified as quasars.\n  Conclusions. Using prior information about quasar proper motions we could\nprovide an independent verification of the parallax zero-point in early\nsolutions based on less than one year of Gaia data.\n","Comment: Astronomy & Astrophysics, accepted 25 October 2015, in press.

Then, they are expected to maintain\ntheir fossil status because of the few interactions with the large-scale\nstructure. In this context, the magnitude gap between the two brightest\ngalaxies of the system is considered a good indicator of its dynamical status.\nAs a consequence, the systems with the largest gaps should be dynamically\nrelaxed.

We analysed the properties of the bright and\nfaint galaxies in fossil and non-fossil groups during the past 8 Gyr. We\nobserved that the brightest galaxy in fossil groups is typically brighter and\nmore massive than their counterparts in control groups. Fossil groups developed\ntheir large magnitude gap between the brightest galaxies around 3.5 Gyr ago.\nThe brightest galaxy stellar masses of all groups show a notorious increment at\nthat time. By analysing the behaviour of the magnitude gap between the first\nand the second, third, and fourth ranked galaxies, we found that at earlier\ntimes, fossil groups comprised two large brightest galaxies with similar\nmagnitudes surrounded by much fainter galaxies, while in control groups these\nmagnitude gaps were never as large as in fossils. At early times, fossil groups\nin the faint population were denser than non-fossil groups, then this trend\nreversed, and finally they became similar at the present day. The mean number\nof faint galaxies in non-fossil systems increases in an almost constant rate\ntowards later times, while this number in fossil groups reaches a plateau at\n$z\\sim0.6$ that lasts $\\sim 2$ Gyr, and then starts growing again more rapidly.\nThe formation of fossil groups is defined at the very beginning of the groups\naccording to their galaxy luminosity sampling, which could be determined by\ntheir merging rate at early times.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

The critical mass accretion\nrate for the ADAF can be estimated by equating the equilibration timescale to\naccretion timescale of the ADAF, which is sensitive to its radial velocity. The\nradial velocity of thin disks is very small, which leads to the advection of\nthe external field in thin disks very inefficient. ADAFs are present in the\nlow/hard states of XRBs, and their radial velocity is large compared with the\nthin disk. The external field can be dragged inward efficiently by the ADAF, so\na strong large-scale magnetic field threading the ADAF can be formed, which may\naccelerate a fraction of gas in the ADAF into the outflows. Such outflows may\ncarry away a large amount of angular momentum from the ADAF, which increases\nthe radial velocity of the ADAF significantly.

It is frequently argued that shocks\nare the main driver of the flaring events. However, the spectral variability\nmodelings generally lack detailed considerations of the self-consistent\nmagnetic field evolution modeling, thus so far the associated optical\npolarization signatures are poorly understood. We present the first\nsimultaneous modeling of the optical radiation and polarization signatures\nbased on 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of relativistic shocks in the\nblazar emission environment, with the simplest physical assumptions. By\ncomparing the results with observations, we find that shocks in a weakly\nmagnetized environment will largely lead to significant changes in the optical\npolarization signatures, which are seldom seen in observations.

In particular we discuss the appearance of a wildly\nembedded 3-manifold which we identify with a quantum state. Furthermore, we\nanalyze this quantum state by using foliation theory and relate it to an\nelement in an operator algebra. Then we describe a set of geometric,\nnon-commutative operators, the skein algebra, which can be used to determine\nthe geometry of a 3-manifold. This operator algebra can be understood as a\ndeformation quantization of the classical Poisson algebra of observables given\nby holonomies. The structure of this operator algebra induces an action by\nusing the quantized calculus of Connes. The scaling behavior of this action is\nanalyzed to obtain the classical theory of General Relativity (GRT) for large\nscales.

A good atomization process could help the fuel to mix with the\nair properly leading to its efficient combustion, thereby reducing the emitted\npollutants as well. The recent trend followed by the engineers focused on\ndesigning fuel injectors for more efficient atomization is to increase the\natomization pressure while decreasing the nozzle orifice diameter. A\nconsequence of this is the development of cavitation (formation of vapor\ncavities or bubbles in the liquid) inside the injector close to the nozzle. The\nmain reason behind this is the sudden changes in the pressure inside the\ninjector and these cavities or bubbles are usually formed where the pressure is\nrelatively low.This work mainly focuses on studying the formation of cavitation\nand its effect on the velocity of the spray in the near nozzle region using\nasymmetrical transparent nozzle equipped with a needle lift sensor with nozzle\ndiameter of 0.35 mm at 300 bar of injection pressure.

Most existing change detection\nprocedures assume perfect knowledge of the random process distributions before\nand after the change point. However, in many practical applications such as\nanomaly detection, the post-change distribution is often unknown and needs to\nbe estimated with a limited number of samples. In this paper, we study the case\nthat there is a mismatch between the true post-change distribution and the one\nused during detection. We analytically identify the impacts of mismatched\npost-change models on two classical detection procedures, the cumulative sum\n(CUSUM) procedure and the Shiryaev-Roberts (SR) procedure. The impacts of\nmismatched models are characterized in terms of various finite or asymptotic\nperformance bounds on ARL, PFA, and average detection delay (ADD). It is shown\nthat post-change model mismatch results in an increase in ADD, and the rate of\nperformance degradation depends on the difference between two Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergences, one is between the priori- and post-change distributions, and\nthe other one is between the true and mismatched post-change distributions.\n","Comment: Abbreviated version submitted to IEEE ISIT 2016"]}]

Neither of\nthese philosophies has led to success. In the present paper, we show that there\nexists an algebraic generalisation of geometry that reconciles, in a sense,\nthese two seemingly opposite standpoints. The geometry is constructed with the\nhelp of a noncommutative algebra of smooth functions on a groupoid and its\nderivations. The groupoid in question has a nice physical interpretation: it\ncan be regarded as a space of Lorentz rotations. In this way, Lorentz\nsymmetries are inherent to the generalised geometry of space-time. We define\nthe action for this geometry and, by varying it, obtain generalised vacuum\nEinstein equations (for a simplified model). It turns out that these equations\ncontain additional terms (with respect to the standard vacuum Einstein\nequations) which are naturally interpreted as the components of the\nenergy-momentum tensor. Matter is thus created out of purely geometric degrees\nof freedom. We find two exact solutions (for even more simplified case).

The case of partial\nwetting is considered. The drops are in an atmosphere of nitrogen saturated\nwith water where they grow by condensation and eventually touch each other and\ncoalesce. A new convex composite drop is rapidly formed that then exponentially\nand slowly relaxes to an equilibrium hemispherical cap. The characteristic\nrelaxation time is proportional to the drop radius R * at final equilibrium.\nThis relaxation time appears to be nearly 10 7 times larger than the bulk\ncapillary relaxation time t b = R * $\\eta$/$\\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the\ngas--liquid surface tension and $\\eta$ is the liquid shear viscosity. In order\nto explain this extremely large relaxation time, we consider a model that\ninvolves an Arrhenius kinetic factor resulting from a liquid--vapour phase\nchange in the vicinity of the contact line. The model results in a large\nrelaxation time of order t b exp(L/RT) where L is the molar latent heat of\nvaporization, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. We model the late\ntime relaxation for a near spherical cap and find an exponential relaxation\nwhose typical time scale agrees reasonably well with the experiment. 1.\nIntroduction Fusion or coalescence between drops is a key process in a wide\nrange of phenomena: phase transition in fluids and liquid mixtures or polymers,\nstability of foams and emulsions, and sintering in metallurgy (Eggers 1998),\nwhich is why the problem of coalescence has already received considerable\nattention. Most of the studies of this process so far have been devoted to the\ncoalescence of two spherical drops floating in a medium. The kinetics of the\nprocess before and after the drops have touched each other is governed by the\nhydrodynamics inside and outside the drops and by the van der Waals forces when\nthe drops are within mesoscopic distance from each other (Yiantsios \\& Davis\n1991). The composite drop that results from the coalescence of two drops\nrelaxes to a spherical shape within a time which is dominated by the relaxation\nof the flow inside and outside (Nikolayev, Beysens \\& Guenoun 1996; Nikolayev\n\\& Beysens 1997). There are no studies, to our knowledge, of the coalescence of\ntwo sessile drops after they touch each other. In this paper, we report a\npreliminary study of the dynamics and morphology of this process, in the case\nof hemispherical water droplets which grow slowly on a plane surface at the\nexpense of the surrounding atmosphere, forming what is called 'dew' or 'breath\nfigures' (Beysens et al. 1991; Beysens 1995).

The VUV photodesorption of intact methanol molecules from pure\nmethanol ices is found to be of the order of 10$^{-5}$ molecules/photon, that\nis two orders of magnitude below what is generally used in astrochemical\nmodels. This rate gets even lower ($<$ 10$^{-6}$ molecules/photon) when the\nmethanol is mixed with CO molecules in the ices. This is consistent with a\npicture in which photodissociation and recombination processes are at the\norigin of intact methanol desorption from pure CH$_3$OH ices. Such low rates\nare explained by the fact that the overall photodesorption process is dominated\nby the desorption of the photofragments CO, CH$_3$, OH, H$_2$CO and\nCH$_3$O/CH$_2$OH, whose photodesorption rates are given in this study. Our\nresults suggest that the role of the photodesorption as a mechanism to explain\nthe observed gas phase abundances of methanol in cold media is probably\noverestimated.

For example, we observe that the\nsolutions to the Bayesian and the robust (i.e., non-Bayesian) optimal auction\ndesign problems in the convex perceived payment setting do not coincide like\nthey do in the case of linear payments. We therefore study the two problems in\nturn.\n  We derive an upper and a heuristic lower bound on expected revenue in our\nsetting. These bounds are easily computed pointwise, and yield monotonic\nallocation rules, so can be supported by Myerson payments (suitably adjusted).\nIn this way, our bounds yield heuristics that approximate the optimal robust\nauction, assuming convex perceived payments.\n  We close with experiments, the final set of which massages the output of one\nof the closed-form heuristics for the robust problem into an extremely fast,\nnear-optimal heuristic solution to the Bayesian optimal auction design problem.\n"]}]

The rotation by itself will not deform the AGB\nwind, but may trigger another process that will lead to axisymmetric mass loss,\ne.g., weak magnetic activity, as in the cool magnetic spots model. This model\nalso explains the transition from spherical to axisymmetric mass loss on the\nupper AGB. For such low mass planets to substantially spin-up the stellar\nenvelope, they should enter the envelope when the star reaches the upper AGB.\nThis \"fine-tuning\" can be avoided if there are several planets on average\naround each star, as is the case in the solar system, so that one of them is\nengulfed when the star reaches the upper AGB.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 1 figure.

Star formation is initiated on large scales by gravitational\ninstabilities which control the overall rate through the long dynamical time\ncorresponding to the average ISM density. Stars form at much higher densities\nthan average, however, and at much faster rates locally, so the slow average\nrate arises because the fraction of the gas mass that forms stars at any one\ntime is low, ~10^{-4}. This low fraction is determined by turbulence\ncompression, and is apparently independent of specific cloud formation\nprocesses which all operate at lower densities. Turbulence compression also\naccounts for the formation of most stars in clusters, along with the cluster\nmass spectrum, and it gives a hierarchical distribution to the positions of\nthese clusters and to star-forming regions in general. Turbulent motions appear\nto be very fast in irregular galaxies at high redshift, possibly having speeds\nequal to several tenths of the rotation speed in view of the morphology of\nchain galaxies and their face-on counterparts.

Independent\nobservational constraints on the neutral hydrogen content at high redshifts and\nthe amount of dust in high redshift systems can be obtained from a radio search\nagainst the bright lobes of distant radio galaxies (which is less affected by\nthe presence of dust in foreground damped-lyman alpha systems). We describe\nhere a pilot radio survey along the line of sight to a small sample of high\nredshift radio galaxies, and also present some preliminary results. The survey\nuses a novel observing mode at the WSRT which enables one to make sensitive\nsearches of a large redshift interval in a modest amount of telescope time.\n","Comment: A version with figures is available at http://www.nfra.nl/~chengalu/\n  To appear in \"Cold Gas at High Redshift\", Eds.

In this paper, we investigate the fate of the gas\nring, involving self-gravity of gas, using two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations. We find that the gas ring becomes gravitationally unstable for a\ngas surface density of gas above a critical value, and fragments into several\ngas clumps. Some denser clumps increase their mass via the accretion of the\nsurrounding gas and collisions with other clumps, and finally a very massive\ngas clump (10^7 M_sun) is formed. Due to the torque from the most massive\nclump, a part of the gas in the ring loses its angular momentum and falls into\nthe galactic center. As a result, a nuclear gas disk (50 pc) is formed around\nthe SMBH. The accretion rate for $R<50$ pc attains about 1 M_sun/yr for\n3.5*10^7 yr. At the final phase of the bar-driven fueling, self-gravity is\ncrucial for the angular momentum transfer of the gas.

The\npath to such structures intertwines many branches of mathematics and\ntheoretical physics (Yang-Mills and other gauge theories). An overview of these\ntopics is provided, followed by certain results concerning the geometry and\nphysics of such manifolds. Although exotic ${\\bf R^4}$'s cannot be effectively\nexhibited by finite constructions, certain existence and non-existence results\ncan be stated. For example, it is shown that the ``exoticness'' can be confined\nto a time-like world tube, providing a possible model for an exotic source.\nOther suggestions and conjectures for future research are made.\n","Comment: To appear in proceedings of Pacific Conference on Gravitation and\n  Cosmology, Seoul , 1996.

In this picture, the coordinate base units\nin gravity-induced spacetime metric are defined by the standard clock and ruler\nequipped by the observer, and duplicated onto the every position of the whole\nuniverse. In contrast, the local intrinsic base units of spacetime in\ngravitational field are defined by the length and duration of physical events\nintervals in the same-type standard clock and ruler which are really located at\nevery position of the universe. In principle, the reading number of the\nstandard clock is counted by the undergone times of unit intervals defined\ndepending on a certain kind of local intrinsic events. But the size of the base\nunits of spacetime is essentially depicted by the length of the line segment,\nwhich is cut from the absolute background of spacetime by the local intrinsic\nevents of unit interval. The effect of gravitation is just to change the length\nof this segment for base spacetime units. On the basis of such a physical\npicture of spacetime, in a fairly natural way we re-derive a new classical\ndynamical equation which satisfies a more realistic and moderately general\nprinciple of relativity. To further examine this physical picture including of\ngravitation and spacetime, we also reinterpret the gravitational redshifts for\nsolar gravity tests.\n","Comment: 10 pages.
