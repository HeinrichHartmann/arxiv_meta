This insulator becomes a metal upon the introduction of\nextremely low concentration of n-type dopants. However, signatures of the\nstructural phase transition in charge conduction have remained elusive.\nEmploying the Montgomery technique, we succeed in resolving the anisotropy of\ncharge conductivity induced by the AFD transition, in the presence of different\ntypes of dopants. We find that the slight lattice distortion ($<6 \\times\n10^{-4}$) gives rise to a twenty percent anisotropy in charge conductivity, in\nagreement with the expectations of band calculations. Application of uniaxial\nstrain amplifies the detectable anisotropy by disfavoring one of the three\npossible tetragonal domains.

Increasing the concentration of dopants leads to a drastic shift in\nthe temperature of the AFD transition either upward or downward.

Despite the reports in literature of ab initio band structures\nfor these wurtzite compounds, we still lack effective multiband models and\nparameter sets that can be simply used to investigate physical properties of\nsuch systems, for instance, under quantum confinement effects. In order to\naddress this deficiency, in this study we calculate the ab initio band\nstructure of bulk InAs and InP in wurtzite phase and develop an 8$\\times$8 k.p\nHamiltonian to describe the energy bands around $\\Gamma$ point. We show that\nour k.p model is robust and can be fitted to describe the important features of\nthe ab initio band structure. The correct description of the spin splitting\neffects that arise due to the lack of inversion symmetry in wurtzite crystals,\nis obtained with the $k$-dependent spin-orbit term in the Hamiltonian, often\nneglected in the literature. All the energy bands display a Rashba-like spin\ntexture for the in-plane spin expectation value. We also provide the density of\nstates and the carrier density as functions of the Fermi energy. Alternatively,\nwe show an analytical description of the conduction band, valid close to\n$\\Gamma$ point. The same fitting procedure is applied to the 6$\\times$6 valence\nband Hamiltonian.

The wobble enables plasma to be\ntransported to higher latitudes and then centrifugal acceleration leads to\nradial transport of the plasma. At the interface between the middle and outer\nmagnetosphere, the wobble produces a sinusoidal modulation of the plasma\nproperties, which yields at a fixed observing point two density peaks, each\nwith the planetary period. However, because of solar wind forcing and the fast\nrotation of Jupiter, torques are exerted on the outer magnetospheric plasma\nsuch that the azimuthal speed between the southern and northern hemispheres are\nunequal. This leads to the asymmetric square wave modulation of the plasma\nproperties in the outer magnetosphere such that only one density peak is seen\neach planetary period in the outer magnetosphere. This differential speed leads\nto reconnection in the tail at the planetary period and enhanced ejection of\nplasma down the tail at the planetary period. These processes could explain the\nperiodicity seen in the New Horizons' data without the need for invoking\narbitrary solar wind conditions. The energetic particles generated by these\nprocesses are shown to map to the arc-like structures seen in the dusk side\nauroral features.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 16 figures"]}]

As\ndemonstrated by these studies, the equilibrium solutions of the system are\nseparated into two branches: the flux rope sticks to the photosphere for\nsolutions at the lower branch but is suspended in the corona for those at the\nupper branch. Moreover, a solution originally at the lower branch jumps to the\nupper, as the related control parameter increases and reaches a critical value,\nand the associated jump is here referred to as upward catastrophe. The present\npaper advances these studies in three aspects. First, the magnetic field is\nchanged to be force-free. The system still experiences an upward catastrophe\nwith an increase in each control parameter. Secondly, under the force-free\napproximation, there also exists a downward catastrophe, characterized by a\njump of a solution from the upper branch to the lower. Both catastrophes are\nirreversible processes connecting the two branches of equilibrium solutions so\nas to form a cycle. Finally, the magnetic energy in the numerical domain is\ncalculated. It is found that there exists a magnetic energy release for both\ncatastrophes. The Amp\\`{e}re's force, which vanishes everywhere for force-free\nfields, appears only during the catastrophes and does a positive work, which\nserves as a major mechanism for the energy release. The implications of the\ndownward catastrophe and its relevance to solar activities are briefly\ndiscussed.\n"]}]

Compared to existing MHD methods, PPMLR-MHD achieves the\nadvantage of high order spatial accuracy and low numerical dissipation.\nHowever, the accuracy comes at a cost. On one hand, this method requires more\nintensive computation. On the other hand, more boundary data is subject to be\ntransferred during the process of simulation.s In this work, we present a\nparallel hybrid solution of the PPMLR-MHD model implemented using the computing\ncapabilities of both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate that our optimized\nimplementation alleviates the data transfer overhead by using GPU Direct\ntechnology and can scale up to 151 processes and achieve significant\nperformance gains by distributing the workload among the CPUs and GPUs on Titan\nat Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

RISC-V was designed\nas a very small ISA to support a wide range of implementations, and has a less\nmature compiler toolchain. However, we observe that on SPEC CINT2006 RV64G\nexecutes on average 16% more instructions than x86-64, 3% more instructions\nthan IA-32, 9% more instructions than ARMv8, but 4% fewer instructions than\nARMv7.\n  CISC x86 implementations break up complex instructions into smaller internal\nRISC-like micro-ops, and the RV64G instruction count is within 2% of the x86-64\nretired micro-op count. RV64GC, the compressed variant of RV64G, is the densest\nISA studied, fetching 8% fewer dynamic instruction bytes than x86-64.

Combining the\ncompressed RISC-V ISA extension with macro-op fusion provides both the densest\nISA and the fewest dynamic operations retired per program, reducing the\nmotivation to add more instructions to the ISA.

We\nfocus our attention on the mechanisms by which rotational and translational\ndegrees of freedom of the water monomers gain energy from these sub-cycle\npulses with an electric field amplitude of up to about 0.6~V/{\\AA}. It has been\nrecently shown that pulses with these characteristics can be generated in the\nlaboratory [PRL 112, 213901 (2014)]. Through their permanent dipole moment,\nwater molecules are acted upon by the electric field and forced off their\npreferred hydrogen-bond network conformation. This immediately sets them in\nmotion with respect to one another as energy quickly transfers to their\nrelative center of mass displacements. We find that, in the bulk, the operation\nof these mechanisms is strongly dependent on the initial temperature and\ndensity of the system. In low density systems, the equilibration between\nrotational and translational modes is slow due to the lack of collisions\nbetween monomers. As the initial density of the system approaches 1~g/cm$^3$,\nequilibration between rotational and translational modes after the pulse\nbecomes more efficient. In turn, low temperatures hinder the direct energy\ntransfer from the pulse to rotational motion owing to the resulting stiffness\nof the hydrogen bond network. For small clusters of just a few water molecules\nwe find that fragmentation due to the interaction with the pulse is faster than\nequilibration between rotations and translations, meaning that the latter\nremain colder than the former after the pulse.\n"]}]

We\ninvestigate the linearised, 3D MHD equations under the assumptions of ideal and\ncold plasma. We utilise the WKB approximation and Charpit's method during our\ninvestigation. It is found that the behaviour of the fast magnetoacoustic wave\nis entirely dictated by the local, inhomogeneous, equilibrium Alfv\\'en speed\nprofile. All parts of the wave experience refraction during propagation, where\nthe magnitude of the refraction effect depends on the location of an individual\nwave element within the inhomogeneous magnetic field. The X-line, along which\nthe Alfv\\'en speed is identically zero, acts as a focus for the refraction\neffect. There are two main types of wave behaviour: part of the wave is either\ntrapped by the X-line or escapes the system, and there exists a critical\nstarting region around the X-line that divides these two types of behaviour.\nFor the set-up investigated, it is found that $15.5\\%$ of the fast wave energy\nis trapped by the X-line.
