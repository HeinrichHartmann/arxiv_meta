We also compare\nthe `dynamical systems picture' resulting from this approach with other work on\ngeneric spacelike singularities: the metric approach of Belinskii, Lifschitz,\nand Khalatnikov, and the recent Iwasawa based Hamiltonian method used by\nDamour, Henneaux, and Nicolai; in particular we show that the cosmological\nbilliards obtained by the latter and the cosmological billiard attractor form\ncomplementary `dual' descriptions of the generic asymptotic dynamics of generic\nspacelike singularities.\n","Comment: 14 pages, six figures; invited talk at the 11th Marcel Grossmann\n  Meeting on Recent Developments in General Relativity, Berlin, Germany, 23-29\n  July 2006"]}]

Compared with a traditional MVNO who often leases spectrum via\nlong-term contracts, a C-MVNO can acquire spectrum dynamically in short-term by\nboth sensing the empty \"spectrum holes\" of licensed bands and dynamically\nleasing from the spectrum owner. As a result, a C-MVNO can make flexible\ninvestment and pricing decisions to match the current demands of the secondary\nunlicensed users. Compared to dynamic spectrum leasing, spectrum sensing is\ntypically cheaper, but the obtained useful spectrum amount is random due to\nprimary licensed users' stochastic traffic. The C-MVNO needs to determine the\noptimal amounts of spectrum sensing and leasing by evaluating the trade off\nbetween cost and uncertainty. The C-MVNO also needs to determine the optimal\nprice to sell the spectrum to the secondary unlicensed users, taking into\naccount wireless heterogeneity of users such as different maximum transmission\npower levels and channel gains. We model and analyze the interactions between\nthe C-MVNO and secondary unlicensed users as a Stackelberg game.

If the optimal total transmit power is lower than this cut-off level, all\ntransmit power is allocated to the stronger user, and when the optimal total\ntransmit power is larger than this cut-off level, all transmit power above this\nlevel is allocated to the weaker user. Based on these structural properties of\nthe optimal policy, we propose an algorithm that yields the globally optimal\noff-line scheduling policy.

While an individual sensor node has limited sensing\nregion, processing power, and energy, networking a large number of sensor nodes\ngive rise to a robust, reliable, and accurate sensor network covering a wide\nregion. Thus, routing in WSNs is a very important issue. This paper presents a\nquery-based routing protocol for a WSN that provides different levels of\nQuality of Service (QoS): energy-efficiency, reliability, low latency and\nfault-tolerance-under different application scenarios. The algorithm has low\ncomputational complexity but can dynamically guarantee different QoS support\ndepending on the requirement of the applications. The novelty of the proposed\nalgorithm is its ability to provide multiple QoS support without\nreconfiguration and redeployment of the sensor nodes.

These features are so appealing for multimedia applications that they\nhave spurred a large research effort towards the development of\nmultimedia-specific NC techniques. This paper reviews the recent work in NC for\nmultimedia applications and focuses on the techniques that fill the gap between\nNC theory and practical applications. It outlines the benefits of NC and\npresents the open challenges in this area. The paper initially focuses on\nmultimedia-specific aspects of network coding, in particular delay, in-network\nerror control, and media-specific error control. These aspects permit to handle\nvarying network conditions as well as client heterogeneity, which are critical\nto the design and deployment of multimedia systems. After introducing these\ngeneral concepts, the paper reviews in detail two applications that lend\nthemselves naturally to NC via the cooperation and broadcast models, namely\npeer-to-peer multimedia streaming and wireless networking.\n","Comment: Part of this work is under publication in IEEE Transactions on\n  Multimedia"]}]

Then,\nfor a chosen quality of user rate, the required density of BS is derived based\non the minimum value of rate coverage probability in the cooperation region.\nThe approach guarantees that the achievable rate in the entire coverage region\nis above a target rate with chosen probability. The formulation allows\ncomparison between different orders of BS cooperation, quantifying the reduced\nrequired BS density from higher orders of cooperation.\n","Comment: Accepted for presentation in IEEE Globecom Conf., to be held in\n  Atlanta, USA, Dec. 2013. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1302.1592"]}]

The origin of these close-in\nsuper-Earths and mini-Neptunes is a major unanswered question in planet\nformation. Unlike Earth, whose atmosphere contains $<10^{-6}$ its total mass, a\nlarge fraction of close-in planets have significant gaseous envelopes,\ncontaining $1 -10\\%$ or more of their total mass. It has been proposed that\nthese close-in planets formed in situ either by delivery of $50-100M_{\\oplus}$\nof rocky material to the inner disc, or in a disc enhanced relative to the\nMMSN.

In\nthis paper, we propose a joint transmission scheduling scheme for the radio\naccess and backhaul of small cells in the mmWave band, termed D2DMAC, where a\npath selection criterion is designed to enable device-to-device transmissions\nfor performance improvement. In D2DMAC, a concurrent transmission scheduling\nalgorithm is proposed to fully exploit spatial reuse in mmWave networks.\nThrough extensive simulations under various traffic patterns and user\ndeployments, we demonstrate D2DMAC achieves near-optimal performance in some\ncases, and outperforms other protocols significantly in terms of delay and\nthroughput. Furthermore, we also analyze the impact of path selection on the\nperformance improvement of D2DMAC under different selected parameters.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 26 figures, a journal paper, Accepted by IEEE JSAC Special\n  Issue on Recent Advances in Heterogeneous Networks"]}]

Whereas these materials\nexhibit a very large spin-splitting, they lack an important property concerning\nfunctionalization, namely the possibility to switch or tune the spin texture.\nThis limitation can be overcome in a new class of functional materials\ndisplaying Rashba-splitting coupled to ferroelectricity: the ferroelectric\nRashba semiconductors (FERS). Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (SARPES) we show that GeTe(111) forms a prime member of this\nclass, displaying a complex spin-texture for the Rashba-split surface and bulk\nbands arising from the intrinsic inversion symmetry breaking caused by the\nferroelectric polarization of the bulk (FE).

An issue is how to contain the estimation errors of the\nchannel parameters of the multiple users, considering that the overall\nestimation errors may increase with the number of users because the estimations\nof their channel parameters are intertwined with each other. The second\nchallenge is that the transmitters of the multiple users may be driven by\ndifferent RF oscillators. The associated frequency asynchrony may cause\nmultiple CFOs at the receiver.

A key feature of the proposed system is that\nTDD duplexing selections can be made on a link-by-link basis due to directional\nisolation from other links. We devise an efficient, greedy algorithm for\ncentralized scheduling that maximizes network utility by jointly optimizing the\nduplexing schedule and resources allocation for dense, relay-enhanced OFDMA/TDD\nmmW networks. The proposed algorithm can dynamically adapt to loading, channel\nconditions and traffic demands. Significant throughput gains and improved\nresource utilization offered by our algorithm over the static,\nglobally-synchronized TDD patterns are demonstrated through simulations based\non empirically-derived channel models at 28 GHz.\n","Comment: IEEE Workshop on Next Generation Backhaul/Fronthaul Networks -\n  BackNets 2015"]}]

This greatly limits the usage of FH in many 5G\nscenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective to understand and\ndesign FH for next-generation wireless access. We allow the renovated FH to\ntransport information other than time-domain I/Q samples and to support logical\ntopologies beyond point-to-point links. In this way, different function\nsplitting scheme could be incorporated into the radio access network to satisfy\nthe bandwidth and latency requirements of ultra-dense networks, control/data\n(C/D) decoupling architectures, and delay-sensitive communications. At the same\ntime, massive cooperation and device-centric networking could be effectively\nenabled with point-to-multi-point FH transportation. We analyze three unique\ndesign requirements for the renovated FH, including the ability to handle\nvarious payload traffic, support different logical topology, and provide\ndifferentiated latency guarantee. Following this analysis, we propose a\nreference architecture for designing the renovated FH.

First, we\nintroduce the concept of maxout activation into each convolutional layer of\nCNN, which results in a Max-Feature-Map (MFM).

The non-ideality of this mixture may give rise, at very low\ntemperatures, to a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) and a liquid-liquid\ncritical point (LLCP), at which thermodynamic response functions diverge.\nVarious versions of the \"two-structure equation of state\" (TSEOS) based on this\nconcept have shown remarkable agreement with both experimental data in real\nwater and simulation results. However, recent experiments probing supercooled\nwater at negative pressures reveal the inadequacy of extrapolations of\nequations of state developed for positive pressures, and have begun to shed\nadditional light on the source of the anomalies of supercooled water. We have\nanalyzed simulation results for the TIP4P/2005 model over a broad range of\npositive and negative pressures from ambient temperature to deep supercooling.\nWe find that by explicitly incorporating a liquid-vapor spinodal into a\ntwo-structure equation of state, we are able to match the simulation data in\nTIP4P/2005 with striking accuracy. In particular, our equation of state\nreproduces the observed lines of minima and maxima in the density, isothermal\ncompressibility, and isobaric heat capacity. Contrary to scenarios in which a\nretracing spinodal accounts for the thermodynamic anomalies of water, we find\nthat the liquid-vapor spinodal in this model continues monotonically to lower\npressures as temperature is decreased, influencing but not giving rise to the\nlocus of density maxima and other thermodynamic anomalies.

A small fraction of these, most notably\nSwift J1644+57, produce radio synchrotron emission, consistent with a powerful,\nrelativistic jet shocking the surrounding circumnuclear gas. The dearth of\nsimilar non-thermal radio emission in the majority of TDEs may imply that\npowerful jet formation is intrinsically rare, or that the conditions in\ngalactic nuclei are typically unfavorable for producing a detectable signal.\nHere we explore the latter possibility by constraining the radial profile of\nthe gas density encountered by a TDE jet using a one-dimensional model for the\ncircumnuclear medium which includes mass and energy input from a stellar\npopulation. Near the jet Sedov radius of 10$^{18}$ cm, we find gas densities in\nthe range of $n_{18} \\sim$ 0.1$-$1000 cm$^{-3}$ across a wide range of\nplausible star formation histories. Using one- and two-dimensional relativistic\nhydrodynamical simulations, we calculate the synchrotron radio light curves of\nTDE jets (as viewed both on and off-axis) across the allowed range of density\nprofiles. We find that bright radio emission would be produced across the\nplausible range of nuclear gas densities by jets as powerful as Swift J1644+57,\nand we quantify the relationship between the radio luminosity and jet energy.\nWe use existing radio detections and upper limits to constrain the energy\ndistribution of TDE jets.

We show that, under some minor technical conditions, these functions\ntogether with integer linear programming-based functions are sufficient to\nyield the integer hull of intersections of conic sections in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n"]}]

The sense of the radial streaming in the\neyelids is consistent with the idea that gas from the outer part of IC 2163\nflows inward until its radial streaming slows down abruptly and the gas piles\nup in the eyelids. The radial compression at the eyelids causes an increase in\nthe gas column density by direct radial impact and also leads to a high rate of\nshear. We find a strong correlation between the molecular column densities and\nthe magnitude of dv/dR across the width of the eyelid at fixed values of\nazimuth. Substantial portions of the eyelids have high velocity dispersion in\nCO, indicative of elevated turbulence there.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 10 postscript figures, uses emulateapj, accepted by ApJ"]}]

We simulate\nboth these and the more prevalent large-scale \"up loops\" by modeling coronal\nheating as a time-steady superposition of: (1) dissipation of incompressible\nAlfven-wave turbulence, and (2) dissipation of compressive waves formed by mode\nconversion from the initial population of Alfven waves. We found that when a\nlarge percentage (> 99%) of the Alfven waves undergo this conversion, heating\nis greatly concentrated at the footpoints and stable \"down loops\" are created.\nIn some cases we found loops with three maxima that are also gravitationally\nstable. Models that agree with the tomographic temperature data exhibit higher\ngas pressures for \"down loops\" than for \"up loops,\" which is consistent with\nobservations. These models also show a narrow range of Alfven wave amplitudes:\n3 to 6 km/s at the coronal base. This is low in comparison to typical observed\namplitudes of 20 to 30 km/s in bright X-ray loops. However, the large-scale\nloops we model are believed to comprise a weaker diffuse background that fills\nmuch of the volume of the corona. By constraining the physics of loops that\nunderlie quiescent streamers, we hope to better understand the formation of the\nslow solar wind.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal. 15 pages\n  (emulateapj style), 11 figures"]}]

We use two\napproaches: the probability distribution function (PDF) of time series\nincrements, and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Noise\ntaints the results, so we focus on the 171 Angstrom waveband , which has the\nhighest signal-to-noise ratio. The lags between pairs of wavebands distinguish\nbetween coronal versus transition region (TR) emission. In all physical regions\nstudied, scaling in the range 15-45 min is multifractal, and the time series\nare anti-persistent on the average. The degree of anti-correlation in the TR\ntime series is greater than for coronal emission. The multifractality stems\nfrom long term correlations in the data rather than the wide distribution of\nintensities. Observations in the 335 Angstrom waveband can be described in\nterms of a multifractal with added noise. The multiscaling of the EUV data\nagrees qualitatively with the radiance from a phenomenological model of\nimpulsive bursts plus noise, and also from ohmic dissipation in a reduced\nmagnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) model for coronal loop heating. The parameter space\nmust be further explored to seek quantitative agreement.

The popular rigid band approximation (RBA), where both\nthe band structure and the exchange splitting are held fixed before and after\nlaser excitation, is unsuitable for this purpose, while the time-dependent\ndensity functional theory could be time-consuming. To overcome these\ndifficulties, we propose a time-dependent Liouville and density functional\ntheory (TDLDFT) that integrates the time-dependent Liouville equation into the\ndensity functional theory. As a result, the excited charge density is\nreiterated back into the Kohn-Sham equation, and the band structure is allowed\nto change dynamically. Even with the ground-state density functional, a larger\ndemagnetization than RBA is found; after we expand Ortenzi's spin scaling\nmethod into an excited-state (laser) density functional, we find that the\nexchange splitting is indeed strongly reduced, as seen in the experiment. Both\nthe majority and minority bands are shifted toward the Fermi level, but the\nmajority shifts a lot more.

State-of-the-art distributed graph querying systems place each graph\npartition on a separate server, where query answering over that partition takes\nplace. This design has two major disadvantages. First, the router needs to\nmaintain a fixed routing table. Hence, these systems are less flexible with\nrespect to query routing, fault tolerance, and graph updates. Second, the graph\ndata must be partitioned such that the workload across the servers is balanced,\nand the inter-machine communication is minimized.

In this work, we mitigate both\nthese problems by decoupling graph storage from query processors, and by\ndeveloping smart routing strategies that improve the cache locality in query\nprocessors. Since a query processor is no longer assigned any fixed part of the\ngraph, it is equally capable of handling any request, thus facilitating load\nbalancing and fault tolerance.

Beside these hypotheses, a credible\nhypothesis proposed by this study to explain the cause of decision biasing,\nsuggests that the decision maker neuron can make use of the residual\ninformation of the previous decisions for the current decision. We demonstrate\nthe validity of this assumption, first by performing behavioral experiments\nbased on the two alternative forced-choice discrimination of motion direction\nparadigms. Secondly, by making use of the fitted models based on accumulation\nto the bound mechanism. In both cases, previous trial's trace can be seen on\nthe current decision.

However, as the volumetric flow rate and the\naspect ratio of the flowing region in the slot increase, the applicability of\nthe pipeline slurry correlations breaks down.

One feature\ncommon to most wall models is that the first few (about 3) grid points must be\nlocated below the inviscid log-layer, and the grid must have near-isotropic\nresolution near the wall.

Therefore, it is\nsuperior to the non-mutagenized impatiens in terms of drought resistance and\ndemonstrates tremendous differences from the normal impatiens in physiology,\nwhich intrigues scholars to search for the underlying reasons . Methods: By\nreference to Impatiens balsamina L,this experiment uses mutagenized impatiens\nseeds, processed by PEG-6000 in different solution concentration, to measure\nthe germination rate of impatiens, its relative enzymatic activity and\nexpression differences between gene SoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower\nreaches. Key results: Under simulated drought stress, there is no distinct\ndifference between the mutagenized impatiens and the normal impatiens in terms\nof germination rate. But by measuring the root tillers and the length, the\nrelative enzymatic activity, MDA, and the expression differences between gene\nSoS2 and gene RD29b in the drought lower reaches, it is verified that the\nmutagenized impatiens has more advantages than the normal impatiens, and it Can\nfurther cultivate become drought resistance varieties impatiens. Conclusions:\nIn this experiment,which is a positive mutation, the mutagenized impatiens\nimproves drought resistance through radiative mutation. The so obtained\nimpatiens is more pleasing in sight in terms of color and shape and has higher\napplication value in garden virescence.\n","Comment: 19 pages,6 figures,1 table"]}]

The inner bound rate regions are achieved by random binning\ntechniques. For the broadcast channel, a double-binning coding scheme allows\nfor both joint encoding and preserving of confidentiality. Furthermore, we show\nthat, for a special case of the interference channel, referred to as the switch\nchannel, the two bound bounds meet.
