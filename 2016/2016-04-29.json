Then we perform numerical simulations\nthat confirm, at the level of the spectral problem, our previous rigorous\nresults, where we showed that mKdV breathers are $H^2$ and $H^1$ stable,\nrespectively. In a second step, we also discuss the Gardner and the Sine-Gordon\ncases, where the spectral study of a fourth-order linear matrix system is the\nkey element to show stability. Using numerical methods, we confirm that all\nspectral assumptions leading to the $H^2\\times H^1$ stability of SG breathers\nare numerically satisfied, even in the ultra-relativistic, singular regime. In\na second part, we study the periodic mKdV case, where a periodic breather is\nknown from the work of Kevrekidis et al. We rigorously show that these\nbreathers satisfy a suitable elliptic equation, and we also show numerical\nspectral stability. However, we also identify the source of nonlinear\ninstability in the case described in Kevrekidis et al. Finally, we present a\nnew class of breather solution for mKdV, believed to exist from geometric\nconsiderations, and which is periodic in time and space, but has nonzero mean,\nunlike standard breathers.\n","Comment: 55 pages; This paper is an improved version of our previous paper\n  1309.0625 and hence we replace it"]}]

In order\nto estimate the importance of this correction, we apply our formalism to a toy\nmodel potential which allows us to consider both the decay of a homogeneous\nbounce and the nucleation of a thin-wall bubble.

Such preferences arise naturally in\nscenarios such as allocating computational resources among users, where the\ngoal is to fairly serve as many requests as possible. In this paper we study\nthe fair division problem for such agents, which is harder to handle due to\ndiscontinuity and complementarities of the preferences.\n  Our solution concept---the competitive allocation from equal incomes\n(CAEI)---is inspired from market equilibria and implements fair outcomes\nthrough a pricing mechanism. We study the existence and computation of CAEI for\nmultiple divisible goods, cake cutting, and multiple discrete goods. For the\nfirst two scenarios we show that existence of CAEI solutions is guaranteed,\nwhile for the third we give a succinct characterization of instances that admit\nthis solution; then we give an efficient algorithm to find one in all three\ncases. Maximizing social welfare turns out to be NP-hard in general, however we\nobtain efficient algorithms for (i) divisible and discrete goods when the\nnumber of different \\emph{types} of players is a constant, (ii) cake cutting\nwith contiguous demands, for which we establish an interesting connection with\ninterval scheduling, and (iii) cake cutting with a constant number of players\nwith arbitrary demands.\n  Our solution is useful more generally, when the players have a target set of\ndesired goods, and very small positive values for any bundle not containing\ntheir target set.\n"]}]

Many of the numerical challenges in\nsimulation of subsurface applications come from the lack of robustness and\naccuracy of numerical methods in the case of highly distorted grids. In this\npaper we investigate and compare the Multi-Point Stress Approximation (MPSA)\nand the Virtual Element Method (VEM) with regards to grid features that are\nfrequently seen in geological models and likely to lead to a lack of accuracy\nof the methods. In particular we look how the methods perform near the\nincompressible limit. This work shows that both methods are promising for\nflexible modeling of subsurface mechanics.\n"]}]

From\n  Vi\\'ete--Euler identity to Anderson localization"],"description":["  It is shown that in a large class of disordered systems with non-degenerate\ndisorder, in presence of non-local interactions, the Integrated Density of\nStates (IDS) is at least H\\\"older continuous in one dimension and universally\ninfinitely differentiable in higher dimensions. This result applies also to the\nIDS in any finite volume subject to the random potential induced by an ambient,\ninfinitely extended disordered media. Dimension one is critical: in the\nBernoulli case, within the class of exponential interactions, the IDS measure\nundergoes continuity phase transitions, from absolutely continuous to singular\ncontinuous behaviour. The continuity transitions do not occur for\nsub-exponential or slower decaying interactions, nor for $d\\ge 2$.\n  The proposed approach provides a complement to the classical Wegner estimate\nwhich says, essentially, that the IDS in the short-range models is at least as\nregular as the marginal distribution of the disorder. In the models with\nnon-local interaction the IDS is actually much more regular than the underlying\ndisorder, which can even be discrete, due to the smoothing effect of multiple\nconvolutions. In turn, smoothness of the IDS is responsable for a mechanism\ncomplementing the usual Lifshitz tails phenomenon.\n  It is also shown that the disorder can take various forms (e.g., substitution\nor random displacements) and need not be stochastically stationary (as in\nDelone--Anderson or trimmed/crooked Hamiltonians, for example).\n  Contrary to the situation with the usual lattice Bernoulli--Anderson\nHamiltonians, the proof of Anderson localization in the models with\ninfinite-range interaction follows in a fairly simple way from the main bounds\non the finite-volume IDS. All nontrivial marginal distributions are treated in\na unified way, via harmonic analysis and without reduction to an embedded\nBernoulli model.\n"]}]
