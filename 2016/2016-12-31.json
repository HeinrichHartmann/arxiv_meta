The maximum\namplification measured in the experiment was 20%, obtained for 3.70 Hz waves,\nin a 6.25 cm deep fluid. Our results are consistent with superradiant\nscattering caused by rapid rotation. In particular, a draining fluid can\ntransfer part of its rotational energy to incident low-frequency waves. Our\nexperimental findings will shed new light on Black Hole Physics, since shallow\nwater waves scattering on a draining fluid constitute an analogue of a black\nhole. We believe, especially in view of the recent observations of\ngravitational waves, that our results will motivate further research (both\ntheoretical and experimental) on the observation of superradiance of\ngravitational waves.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures"]}]

However, considering the wide\nvariety of mathematical properties of Markov chains, there has not been a full\ninvestigation of evolving world economic networks with Markov chain formalism.\nUsing the recently available world input-output database, we modeled the\nevolution of the world economic network from 1995 to 2011 through analysis of a\nseries of finite Markov chains. We assessed different aspects of this evolving\nsystem via different properties of the Markov chains such as mixing time,\nKemeny constant, steady state probabilities and perturbation analysis of the\ntransition matrices. First, we showed how the time series of mixing times and\nKemeny constants could be used as an aggregate index of globalization. Next, we\nfocused on the steady state probabilities as a measure of structural power of\nthe economies that are comparable to GDP shares of economies as the traditional\nindex of economies. Further, we introduced two measures of systemic risk,\ncalled systemic influence and systemic fragility, where the former is the ratio\nof number of influenced nodes to the total number of nodes, caused by a shock\nin the activity of a node and the latter is based on the number of times a\nspecific economic node is affected by a shock in the activity of any of the\nother nodes. Finally, focusing on Kemeny constant as a global indicator of\nmonetary flow across the network, we showed that there is a paradoxical effect\nof a change in activity levels of economic nodes on the overall flow of the\nnetwork. While the economic slowdown of the majority of nodes with high\nstructural power results to a slower average monetary flow over the network,\nthere are some nodes, where their slowdowns improve the overall quality of the\nnetwork in terms of connectivity and the average monetary flow.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]

A\n  Reanalysis of 17 Published Datasets"],"description":["  Background\n  Network analysis in psychopathology is an emerging field. Previous\npublications limited their interpretation largely on the centrality\n(inter-connectedness) of nodes in network structures, where nodes with the\nhighest centrality may be the best targets for interventions. However,\ncentrality is a relative metric: the most central node could be indeed the best\ntarget for an intervention but still be a very bad target. This is the case if\nit shares very little variance with other nodes, and thus intervening on the\nnode will only have a negligible impact on the network structure. Here we\nprovide a solution for this problem by introducing the absolute metric\npredictability - the extent to which a node is determined by all its neighbors\nin the network - and estimate the predictability of all nodes in 17 prior\nempirical network papers on psychopathology.\n  Methods\n  We carried out a literature review and collected 24 datasets from 17\npublished papers in the field (several mood and disorders, substance abuse, and\npsychosis). We fit state-of-the-art regularized partial correlation networks to\nall datasets, and computed the predictability of all nodes.\n  Results\n  Predictability is moderately high in most symptom networks, and differs\nconsiderable both within and between datasets.\n  Conclusions\n  Predictability is an important characterization of symptom networks in\naddition to their structure. It provides a measure of practical relevance of\nconnections among nodes that may be helpful to inform intervention strategies,\nand allows conclusions about how self-determined a symptom network is.\nLimitations of predictability along with future directions are discussed.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 1 table, 4 figures"]}]
