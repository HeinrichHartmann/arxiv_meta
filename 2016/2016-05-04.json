The dynamic of\nthe accreted torus varies with the size of initial stable torus, black hole\nspin and other variables, such as Mach number, sound speed, cusp location of\nthe torus, etc. The mass accretion rate is slightly proportional to the\ntorus-to-hole mass ratio in the black hole-torus system, but it strongly\ndepends on the cusp location of the torus.

The\ninferential performance of our methodology is analyzed by means of an extensive\nstudy of simulated data and real data consisting of leukemia remission times.\nAlthough tailored to the survival analysis context, the procedure we introduce\ncan be adapted to a range of other models for which moments of the posterior\ndistribution can be estimated.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 5 figures"]}]

To overcome this\ndifficulty, under a point-to-point MIMO WET setup, this paper proposes a\ngeneral design framework for a new type of channel learning method based on the\nER's energy measurement and feedback. Specifically, the ER measures and encodes\nthe harvested energy levels over different training intervals into bits, and\nsends them to the ET via a feedback link of limited rate. Based on the\nenergy-level feedback, the ET adjusts transmit beamforming in subsequent\ntraining intervals and obtains refined estimates of the MIMO channel by\nleveraging the technique of analytic center cutting plane method (ACCPM) in\nconvex optimization. Under this general design framework, we further propose\ntwo specific feedback schemes termed energy quantization and energy comparison,\nwhere the feedback bits at each interval are generated at the ER by quantizing\nthe measured energy level at the current interval and comparing it with those\nin the previous intervals, respectively.

Hence, an important open question is whether\nsimilar (or better) theoretical guarantees and practical performance could be\nobtained by considering deterministic, as opposed to random sampling sequences.\nThe objective of this paper is to provide a rigorous answer to this question.\nSpecifically, we first show that PRM, for a certain selection of tuning\nparameters and deterministic low-dispersion sampling sequences, is\ndeterministically asymptotically optimal. Second, we characterize the\nconvergence rate, and we find that the factor of sub-optimality can be very\nexplicitly upper-bounded in terms of the l2-dispersion of the sampling sequence\nand the connection radius of PRM. Third, we show that an asymptotically optimal\nversion of PRM exists with computational and space complexity arbitrarily close\nto O(n) (the theoretical lower bound), where n is the number of points in the\nsequence.

The\nfirst method is to calculate the form factor of the spherically averaged\nSkyrmion charge density; the second uses the Patterson function to calculate\nthe scattering intensity off randomly oriented Skyrmions, and spherically\naverages at the end. We compare our findings with experimental scattering data.\nWe also find approximate analytical formulae for the first zero and first\nstationary point of a form factor.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 38 figures"]}]

With increasing the thickness the low-energy\nshell remains distinct but the spatial distribution of these states spreads.\nThe behavior of the energy levels and localization leads to a thickness\ndependent absorption spectrum where one transition may be tuned in the THz\ndomain and a second transition can be tuned from THz to the infrared range of\nelectromagnetic spectrum. We show how these features may be further controlled\nwith an external magnetic field. In this work the electron-electron Coulomb\nrepulsion is neglected.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures"]}]

The losses are accounted by a Rayleigh dissipative function. As we\nhave shown previously, for such a composite system the modes split into two\ndistinct classes, high-loss and low-loss, according to their dissipative\nbehavior. A principal result of this paper is that for any such system a rather\nuniversal phenomenon of selective overdamping occurs. Namely, first of all the\nhigh-loss modes are all overdamped, i.e., non-oscillatory, as are an equal\nnumber of low-loss modes. Second of all, the rest of the low-loss modes remain\noscillatory (i.e., the underdamped modes) each with an extremely high quality\nfactor (Q-factor) that actually increases as the loss of the lossy component\nincreases. We prove that selective overdamping is a generic phenomenon in\nLagrangian systems with gyroscopic forces and give an analysis of the\noverdamping phenomena in such systems. Moreover, using perturbation theory, we\nderive explicit formulas for upper bound estimates on the amount of loss\nrequired in the lossy component of the composite system for the selective\noverdamping to occur in the generic case, and give Q-factor estimates for the\nunderdamped modes. Central to the analysis is the introduction of the notion of\na \"dual\" Lagrangian system and this yields significant improvements on some\nresults on modal dichotomy and overdamping.

Three main techniques can be\nused to achieve this goal. The first involves waveform modelling. The flux we\nobserve from a hotspot on the neutron star surface offset from the rotational\npole will be modulated by the star's rotation, giving rise to a pulsation.\nInformation about mass and radius is encoded into the pulse profile via\nrelativistic effects, and tight constraints on mass and radius can be obtained.\nThe second technique involves characterising the spin distribution of accreting\nneutron stars.

The two solutions merge into one when\nthe condition $Q_c=\\sqrt{\\frac{-1}{3R_0}}$ is satisfied. The curve of specific\nheat for $Q<Q_c$ has two divergent points and can be divided into three\nregions. Both the large radius region and the small radius region are\nthermodynamically stable with positive specific heat while the medium radius\nregion is unstable with negative specific heat. However, when $Q>Q_c$, the\nspecific heat is always positive, implying the black holes are locally stable\nand no phase transition will take place. Secondly, both the $T-r_+$ curve and\n$T-S$ curve $f(R)$ AdS black holes are investigated and they exhibit Van der\nVaals like behavior as the $P-v$ curve in the former research. Critical\nphysical quantities are obtained and they are consistent with those derived\nfrom the specific heat analysis.

Here, we study the role played by non-linear spiral patterns\nwithin hydrodynamical and non self-gravitating accretion disc assuming that\nexternal disturbances such as infall onto the disc may trigger them. To do so,\nwe computed self-similar solutions that describe discs in which a spiral wave\npropagates. Such solutions present both shocks and critical sonic points that\nwe carefully analyze. For all allowed temperatures and for several spiral\nshocks, we calculated the wave structure. In particular we inferred the angle\nof the spiral patern, the stress it exerts on the disc as well as the\nassociated flux of mass and angular momentum as a function of temperature. We\nquantified the rate of angular momentum transport by means of the dimensionless\n$\\alpha$ parameter. For the thickest disc we considered (corresponding to $h/r$\nvalues of about 1/3), we found values of $\\alpha$ as high as $0.1$, and scaling\nwith the temperature $T$ such that $\\alpha \\propto T^{3/2} \\propto (h/r)^3$.\nThe spiral angle scales with the temperature as $\\arctan(r/h)$.

The flux reached a level more than 10 times higher than any\npreviously recorded flaring state of the source. We present the description of\nthe characteristics of the flare presenting the light curve and the spectral\nparameters of the night-wise spectra and the average spectrum of the whole\nperiod. From these data we aim at detecting the imprint of the Extragalactic\nBackground Light (EBL) in the VHE spectrum of the source, in order to constrain\nits intensity in the optical band. For this we implement the method developed\nby the H.E.S.S. collaboration in which the intrinsic energy spectrum of the\nsource is modeled with a simple function, and the EBL-induced optical depth is\ncalculated using a template EBL model. The likelihood of the observed spectrum\nis then maximized, including a normalization factor for the EBL opacity among\nthe free parameters. From the data collected differential energy spectra was\nproduced for all nights of the observed period. Evaluating the changes in the\nfit parameters we conclude that the spectral shape for most of the nights were\ncompatible, regardless of the flux level, which enabled us to produce an\naverage spectrum from which the EBL imprint could be constrained. The\nlikelihood ratio test shows that the model with an EBL density\n1.07(-0.20,+0.24)_{stat+sys}, relative to the one in the tested EBL template\n(Dominguez et al.2011), is preferred at the 4.6 sigma level to the no-EBL\nhypothesis, with the assumption that the intrinsic source spectrum can be\nmodeled as a log-parabola.

We observe the complex trajectories traced by the\nparticles as they dock on the dales, estimate the binding energy, and explore a\nrange of parameters that favor or disfavor the docking event, thus exploiting\nthe capabilities of our experimental system. We extend the study to colloids\nwith homeotropic anchoring but with an associated point defect instead of a\nSaturn ring and show that they find a different preferred location, i.e. we can\nplace otherwise identical particles at well defined sites according to their\ntopological defect structure. Finally, for deep enough wells, confinement\ndrives topological transitions of Saturn rings to dipoles. This ability to\ntailor wall geometry to guide colloids to well defined sites within nematic\nliquid crystals represents an important new tool in directed assembly.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The goal of the present paper is to attempt to\ninvestigate this issue by analysing a well defined sample.

Using the projected spatial\nauto-correlation function, we derive a clustering comoving length of 5.4+-1.0\nMpc (for gamma=1.8), consistent with results in the literature. We further\nderive the angular correlation function and the corresponding spatial\nclustering length using the Limber's inversion equation and a novel\nparametrization of the clustering evolution model that also takes into account\nthe bias evolution of the host dark matter halo. The Limber's inverted spatial\ncomoving clustering length of 5.5+-1.2 Mpc at a median redshift of z~0.75,\nmatches the directly measured one, from the spatial correlation function\nanalysis, but for a significant non-linear contribution to the growing mode of\nperturbations, estimated independently from literature results of x_0 at\ndifferent redshifts.

In this work we remove this ambiguity (up to unitary\nequivalence) in the case of a massive Dirac free field propagating in a\nspacetime with homogeneous and isotropic spatial sections of spherical\ntopology. Two physically reasonable conditions are imposed in order to arrive\nto this result: (a) The invariance of the vacuum under the spatial isometries\nof the background, and (b) the unitary implementability of the dynamical\nevolution that dictates the Dirac equation. We characterize the Fock\nquantizations with a non trivial fermion dynamics that satisfy these two\nconditions.

The anti-commutation rules for fermion annihilation, creation\noperators suggests the possibility of using anti-commuting Grassmann variables\nto represent these operators. However, in spite of the seminal work by Cahill\nand Glauber and a few applications, the use of Grassmann phase space methods in\nquantum - atom optics to treat fermionic systems is rather rare, though fermion\ncoherent states using Grassmann variables are widely used in particle physics.\n  This paper presents a phase space theory for fermion systems based on\ndistribution functionals, which replace the density operator and involve\nGrassmann fields representing anti-commuting fermion field annihilation,\ncreation operators. It is an extension of a previous phase space theory paper\nfor fermions (Paper I) based on separate modes, in which the density operator\nis replaced by a distribution function depending on Grassmann phase space\nvariables which represent the mode annihilation and creation operators.

It follows from existing theory\nthat ERM enjoys better theoretical properties w.r.t.~prediction and\n$\\ell_2$-estimation error than $\\ell_1$-regularization. In light of this, we\nargue that ERM combined with a subsequent sparsification step like thresholding\nis superior to the heuristic of using $\\ell_1$-regularization after dropping\nthe sum constraint and subsequent normalization.\n  At the next level, we show that any sparsity-promoting regularizer under\nsimplex constraints cannot be convex. A novel sparsity-promoting regularization\nscheme based on the inverse or negative of the squared $\\ell_2$-norm is\nproposed, which avoids shortcomings of various alternative methods from the\nliterature. Our approach naturally extends to Hermitian positive semidefinite\nmatrices with given trace. Numerical studies concerning compressed sensing,\nsparse mixture density estimation, portfolio optimization and quantum state\ntomography are used to illustrate the key points of the paper.\n"]}]

However, ZIA contains one major security weakness - unauthorized\nphysical access to the token, e.g., during lunch-time or upon theft, allows the\nattacker to have unfettered access to the terminal.\n  In this paper, we address this gaping vulnerability with ZIA systems by\n(un)locking the authentication token with the user's walking pattern as she\napproaches the terminal to access it. Since a user's walking or gait pattern is\nbelieved to be unique, only that user (no imposter) would be able to unlock the\ntoken to gain access to the terminal in a ZIA session. While walking-based\nbiometrics schemes have been studied in prior literature for other application\nsettings, our main novelty lies in the careful use of: (1) multiple sensors\navailable on the current breed of devices (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer), and (2) multiple devices carried by the user (in particular, an\n\"in-pocket\" smartphone and a \"wrist-worn\" smartwatch), that all capture unique\nfacets of user's walking pattern.

The regularization is obtained by subtracting a given amount of white\nnoise from the main diagonal of the covariance matrix.

This problem is a very useful example for the Compressive Sensing\n(CS) theoretical study. In this study, the equivalence of Sudoku puzzles L0 and\nL1 minimizations is analyzed. In particular, 17-clue (smallest number of clues)\nuniquely completable puzzles with sparse optimization algorithms are studied\nand divided into two types, namely, type-I and -II puzzles. The solution of L1\nminimization for the type-I puzzles is unique, and the sparse optimization\nalgorithms can solve all of them exactly. By contrast, the solution of L1\nminimization is not unique for the type-II puzzles, and the results of\nalgorithms are incorrect for all these puzzles.

This is problematic for applications and\nsignal processing algorithms that require complete data sets. To address the\nsparse data issue, we present a new gap-fill algorithm. The proposed method\npredicts each missing value separately based on data points in a\nspatio-temporal neighborhood around the missing data point. The computational\nworkload can be distributed among several computers, making the method suitable\nfor large datasets. The prediction of the missing values and the estimation of\nthe corresponding prediction uncertainties are based on sorting procedures and\nquantile regression. The algorithm was applied to MODIS NDVI data from Alaska\nand tested with realistic cloud cover scenarios featuring up to 50% missing\ndata. Validation against established software showed that the proposed method\nhas a good performance in terms of the root mean squared prediction error. The\nprocedure is implemented and available in the open-source R package gapfill. We\ndemonstrate the software performance with a real data example and show how it\ncan be tailored to specific data. Due to the flexible software design, users\ncan control and redesign major parts of the procedure with little effort. This\nmakes it an interesting tool for gap-filling satellite data and for the future\ndevelopment of gap-fill procedures.\n","Comment: 35 pages"]}]

In IST the (quasi-cyclic)\nuniverse $U$ is treated as a deterministic dynamical system evolving precisely\non a measure-zero fractal invariant subset $I_U$ of its state space. In this\napproach, the geometry of $I_U$, and not a set of differential evolution\nequations in space-time $\\mathcal M_U$, provides the most primitive description\nof the laws of physics. As such, IST is non-classical. The geometry of $I_U$ is\nbased on Cantor sets of space-time trajectories in state space, homeomorphic to\nthe algebraic set of $p$-adic integers, for large but finite $p$. In IST, the\nnon-commutativity of position and momentum observables arises from number\ntheory - in particular the non-commensurateness of $\\phi$ and $\\cos \\phi$. The\ncomplex Hilbert Space and the relativistic Dirac Equation respectively are\nshown to describe $I_U$, and evolution on $I_U$, in the singular limit of IST\nat $p=\\infty$; particle properties such as de Broglie relationships arise from\nthe helical geometry of trajectories on $I_U$ in the neighbourhood of $\\mathcal\nM_U$. With the p-adic metric as a fundamental measure of distance on $I_U$,\ncertain key perturbations which seem conspiratorially small relative to the\nmore traditional Euclidean metric, take points away from $I_U$ and are\ntherefore unphysically large. This allows (the $\\psi$-epistemic) IST to evade\nthe Bell and Pusey et al theorems without fine tuning or other objections. In\nIST, the problem of quantum gravity becomes one of combining the\npseudo-Riemannian metric of $\\mathcal M_U$ with the p-adic metric of $I_U$.
