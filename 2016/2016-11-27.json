In case (i), it is shown by SAXS study that\nthe structure - namely the scattering from all chains, characterised by a\nmaximum (\"polyelectrolyte peak\"), of the aqueous hydrophobic polyelectrolyte\nsolutions (PSS) depends on the solvent quality through the added amount of\norganic solvent THF. This dependence is more pronounced when the sulfonation\nrate is low (more hydrophobic polyelectrolyte). It is proposed that when THF is\nadded, the chain conformation evolves from the pearl necklace shape already\nreported in pure water, towards the conformation in pure water for fully\nsulfonated PSS, which is string-like as also reported previously. On the\ncontrary, for a hydrophilic polyelectrolyte, AMAMPS, no evolution occurs with\nadded THF in the aqueous solution. In case (ii), it is shown directly by SANS\nstudy that PSS can behave as a classical solvophilic polyelectrolyte when\ndissolved in an organic polar solvent such as DMSO: the structure (total\nscattering) as well as the form factor (single chain scattering measured by\nSANS using the Zero Average Contrast method) of the PSS chains is independent\nof the charge content in agreement with Manning condensation, and identical to\nthe one of a fully charged PSS chain in pure water, which has a classical\npolyelectrolyte behaviour in the semi-dilute regime.\n"]}]

State-of-the-art reinforcement\nlearning approaches, such as DQN, are model-free and learn to act effectively\nacross a wide range of environments such as Atari games, but require huge\namounts of data. Model-based techniques are more data-efficient, but need to\nacquire explicit knowledge about the environment dynamics or the reward\nstructure.\n  In this paper we take a step towards using model-based techniques in\nenvironments with high-dimensional visual state space when system dynamics and\nthe reward structure are both unknown and need to be learned, by demonstrating\nthat it is possible to learn both jointly. Empirical evaluation on five Atari\ngames demonstrate accurate cumulative reward prediction of up to 200 frames. We\nconsider these positive results as opening up important directions for\nmodel-based RL in complex, initially unknown environments.\n"]}]
