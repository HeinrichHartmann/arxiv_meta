For heavy ($\\sim TeV$) DM, the kinetic energy of WIMPs\nin large (galaxy-sized or larger) halos is capable of producing low-energy\npositrons.

In the present paper, we\ndemonstrate that averaged persistence landscapes can be used to recover central\nsystem information in the Cahn-Hilliard theory of phase separation. More\nprecisely, we show that topological information of evolving microstructures\nalone suffices to accurately detect both concentration information and the\nactual decomposition stage of a data snapshot. Considering that persistent\nhomology only measures discrete connectivity information, regardless of the\nsize of the topological features, these results indicate that the system\nparameters in a phase separation process affect the topology considerably more\nthan anticipated. We believe that the methods discussed in this paper could\nprovide a valuable tool for relating experimental data to model simulations.\n"]}]

We find that the spatially resolved [OIII] line\nwidth on kpc scales is significantly narrower than the one before PSF\ndeblending. The ENLRs appear offset from the QSO position or more elongated\nwhich can be interpreted in favour of a conical outflow on large scales while a\nspherical geometry cannot be excluded for the unresolved NLR. We find that the\nkinetic power at 5kpc distance from the spherical model by Liu et al.

This reduced kinetic power corresponds to\n0.01-0.1% of the bolometric AGN luminosity.

The injected momentum fluxes are close or below the simple\nradiation-pressure limit Lbol/c for the conical outflow model for the NLR and\nENLR when beam smearing is considered.

With low energy supersymmetry breaking, we systematically consider the\nsgoldstino scalar $S$ as the new resonance, which is a linear combination of\nthe CP-even scalar $s$ and CP-odd pseudoscalar $a$. Because we show that $s$\nand $a$ can be degenerated or have large mass splitting, we consider two cases\nfor all the following three scenarios: (1) Single resonance. $s$ is the 750 GeV\nresonance decays to a pair of 1 GeV pseudoscalar $a$. With suitable decay\nlength, these two $a$ decay into collimated pair of photons which cannot be\ndistinguished at the LHC and may appear as diphotons instead of four photons.\n(2) Twin resonances. $m_{s}\\approx m_{a}$ with a mass difference of about 40\nGeV and both $s$ and $a$ decay into diphoton pairs. For productions, we\nconsider three scenarios: (I) vector boson fusion; (II) gluon gluon fusion;\n(III) $q{\\bar q}$ pair production. In all these scenarios with two kinds of\nresonances, we find the parameter space that satisfies the diphoton production\ncross section from 3 to 13 ${\\rm fb}$ and all the other experimental\nconstraints.

Normally, circular\nnanomagnets are incompatible with this approach since they lack distinct stable\nin-plane magnetization orientations to encode bits. However, circular\nmagnetoelastic nanomagnets can be made bi-stable with a voltage induced\nanisotropic strain, which provides two significant advantages for nanomagnetic\nlogic applications. First, the shape anisotropy energy barrier is eliminated\nwhich reduces the amount of energy to reorient the dipole.

For\nsymmetric interaction in both states, i.e., in symmetric bidirectional strings,\nthe errors scale quadratically in the number of vehicles. When the coupling in\nposition is asymmetric, exponential scaling may occur or the system might even\nbecome unstable. The paper thus gives a comprehensive overview of the\nachievable performance in linear, asymmetric, bidirectional platoons.

The\nnanopatterned films contain arrays of holes which can act as preferential\nadsorption sites for small particles.

The same polarity shifts are observed for a\nlarge range of coverages, even when hole-localized particles are covered by\nquasi-continuous particle sheets. For large particles however, preferential\nadsorption no longer occurs, leading to resonance shifts with polarities which\nare independent of the mode localization. Analogous shifts are seen in\ncontinuous layers where, for small particles, the shift of the layer's\nfundamental mode is typically about 10 times less than in patterned systems and\ninduced by relatively weak fields emanating beyond the particle in the\ndirection of the static applied field.

The APOGEE survey has obtained high-resolution infrared spectra of\nmore than 100,000 stars. Deriving chemical abundances patterns of these stars\nis paramount to piecing together the structure of the Milky Way. While the\nderived chemical abundances have been shown to be precise for most stars, some\ncalibration problems have been reported, in particular for more metal- poor\nstars. Aims. In this paper, we aim to (1) re-determine the chemical abundances\nof the APOGEE+Kepler stellar sample (APOKASC) with an independent procedure,\nline list and line selection, and high quality surface gravity information from\nastroseismology, and (2) extend the abundance catalogue by including abundances\nthat are not currently reported in the most recent APOGEE release (DR12).\nMethods. We fixed the Teff and log g to those determined using\nspectrophotometric and asteroseismic techniques, respectively. We made use of\nthe Brussels Automatic Stellar Parameter (BACCHUS) code to derive the\nmetallicity and broadening parameters for the APOKASC sample. In addition, we\nderived differential abundances with respect to Arcturus. Results. We have\nvalidated the BACCHUS code on APOGEE data using several well-known stars, and\nstars from open and globular clusters. We also provide the abundances of C, N,\nO, Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, S, Al, Na, Ni, Mn, Fe, K, P, Cr, Co, Cu, Rb, Yb and V for\nevery star, line, and show the impact of line selection on the final\nabundances. These include abundances of five new elements and improved\nabundances for Si, Ti, S, and V. Conclusions. In this paper, we present an\nindependent analysis of the APOKASC sample and provide abundances of up to 21\nelements.

Explicit scale-compensating\nterms can be included, reflecting known coefficients of higher-order splitting\nterms and reducing the effect of the variations.

An inability to understand and predict\nvariation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.\nLikewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of\nheart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal\nclinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront\npropagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show\nhow variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences\nbetween individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive\ntransversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap\njunctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF\nepisode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between\nindividuals.

The uncoupling of\nmuscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.\nThese critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger\nAF.

An extension of the model to include additional fermions with\nthe new gauge coupling, though not as simple and elegant, can address both\nissues and more.

The H$_{2}$ molecule does not emit efficiently in the\ncold interstellar medium, hence the molecular gas content of galaxies is\ntypically inferred using indirect tracers. At low metallicity and in other\nextreme environments, these tracers can be subject to substantial biases. We\npresent a new method of estimating total molecular gas mass in galaxies\ndirectly from pure mid-infrared rotational H$_{2}$ emission. By assuming a\npower-law distribution of H$_{2}$ rotational temperatures, we can accurately\nmodel H$_{2}$ excitation and reliably obtain warm ($T\\!\\gtrsim\\!100$ K) H$_{2}$\ngas masses by varying only the power law's slope. With sensitivities typical of\nSpitzer/IRS, we are able to directly probe the H$_{2}$ content via rotational\nemission down to ~80 K, accounting for ~15% of the total molecular gas mass in\na galaxy. By extrapolating the fitted power law temperature distributions to a\ncalibrated \\emph{single} lower cutoff temperature, the model also recovers the\ntotal molecular content within a factor of ~2.2 in a diverse sample of\ngalaxies, and a subset of broken power law models performs similarly well.

The\nsecond sub-system is the metrology, it projects young fringes on the CCD. The\nfringes are created by two single mode fibers facing the CCD and fixed on the\nmirror. In this paper we present the latest experiments conducted and the\nresults obtained after a series of upgrades on the testbed was completed. The\ncalibration system yielded the pixel positions to an accuracy estimated at 4e-4\npixel. After including the pixel position information, an astrometric accuracy\nof 6e-5 pixel was obtained, for a PSF motion over more than 5 pixels. In the\nstatic mode (small jitter motion of less than 1e-3 pixel), a photon noise\nlimited precision of 3e-5 pixel was reached.\n"]}]

Two classes appear\nto stand out: X-ray and optical TDEs, the latter featuring lower effective\ntemperatures and luminosities. These differences can be explained if the\nradiation detected from the two categories of events originates from different\nlocations. In practice, this location is set by the evolution of the debris\nstream around the black hole and by the energy dissipation associated with it.\nIn this paper, we build an analytical model for the stream evolution, whose\ndynamics is determined by both magnetic stresses and shocks. Without magnetic\nstresses, the stream always circularizes. The ratio of the circularization\ntimescale to the initial stream period is $t_{\\rm ev}/t_{\\rm min} = 8.3 (M_{\\rm\nh}/10^6 M_{\\odot})^{-5/3} \\beta^{-3}$, where $M_{\\rm h}$ is the black hole mass\nand $\\beta$ is the penetration factor. If magnetic stresses are strong, they\ncan lead to the stream ballistic accretion. The boundary between\ncircularization and ballistic accretion corresponds to a critical magnetic\nstresses efficiency $v_{\\rm A}/v_{\\rm c} \\approx 10^{-1}$, largely independent\nof $M_{\\rm h}$ and $\\beta$. However, the main effect of magnetic stresses is to\naccelerate the stream evolution by strengthening self-crossing shocks.\nBallistic accretion therefore necessarily occurs on the stream dynamical\ntimescale. The shock luminosity associated to energy dissipation is\nsub-Eddington but decays as $t^{-5/3}$ only for a slow stream evolution.\nFinally, we find that the stream thickness rapidly increases if the stream is\nunable to cool completely efficiently. A likely outcome is its fast evolution\ninto a thick torus, or even an envelope completely surrounding the black hole.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS. 3D\n  visualizations of the model can be found at\n  http://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~bonnerot/research.html"]}]

In order to understand\nthe difference between the simulation results and the conventional ellipsoidal\ncollapse model (EC), we first consider the evolution of individual simulated\nhalos. The major difference between EC and the simulation becomes appreciable\nafter the turn-around epoch. Moreover, it is sensitive to the individual\nevolution history of each halo. Despite such strong dependence on individual\nhalos, the resulting nonsphericity of halos exhibits weak but robust mass\ndependence in a statistical fashion; massive halos are more spherical up to the\nturn-around, but gradually become less spherical by z = 0. This is clearly\ninconsistent with the EC prediction; massive halos are usually more spherical.\nIn addition, at z=0, inner regions of the halos are less spherical than outer\nregions, i.e., the density distribution inside the halos is highly\ninhomogeneous and therefore not self-similar. Since most of previous fitting\nformulae for the PDF of axis ratio of triaxial ellipsoids have been constructed\nunder the self-similarity assumption, they are not accurate. Indeed, we compute\nthe PDF of projected axis ratio a1/a2 directly from the simulation data without\nthe self-similarity assumption, and find that it is very sensitive to the\nassumption. The latter needs to be carefully taken into account in direct\ncomparison with observations, and therefore we provide an empirical fitting\nformula for the PDF of a1/a2. Our preliminary analysis suggests that the\nderived PDF of a1/a2 roughly agrees with the current weak-lensing observations.\nMore importantly, the present results will be useful in future exploration of\nthe non-sphericity of clusters in X-ray and optical observations.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in PASJ"]}]

We then show that the spectral indexes of the histograms of soft\nX-ray fluxes observed by GOES satellites in two different energy channels are\ndifferent: the higher energy channel has a harder distribution than the lower\nenergy channel, which challenges the universal power-law distribution predicted\nby SOC models and implies a very soft distribution of thermal energy content of\nplasmas probed by the GOES.

These shocks can be viewed as being produced by fluid elements which\ndrift into the cavity and, before being accreted, are accelerated onto\ntrajectories that send them back to impact the disc. The rate of energy\ndissipation is approximately equal to the product of potential energy per unit\nmass at the disc's inner edge and the accretion rate, estimated from the disc\nparameters just beyond the cavity edge, that would occur without the binary.\nFor very thin discs, the actual accretion rate onto the binary may be\nsignificantly less.

We present a novel\napproach for studying loss cone repopulation in galactic nuclei. Since loss\ncone repopulation in triaxial systems owes to orbit diffusion, it is a purely\ncollisionless phenomenon and can be studied with an approximated force\ncalculation technique, provided the force errors are well behaved and\nsufficiently small. We achieve this using an accurate fast multipole method and\ndefine a proxy for the hardening rate that depends only on stellar angular\nmomenta. We find that the loss cone is efficiently replenished even in very\nmildly triaxial models (with axis ratios 1 : 0.9 : 0.8). Such triaxiality is\nunavoidable following galactic mergers and can drive binaries into the\ngravitational wave regime. We conclude that there is no final parsec problem.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

This accentuated long-term concerns about the current Internet\narchitecture and prompted interest in alternative designs.\n  The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) has been one of the key supporters\nof efforts to design a set of candidate next-generation Internet architectures.\nAs a prominent design requirement, NSF emphasized \"security and privacy by\ndesign\" in order to avoid the long and unhappy history of incremental patching\nand retrofitting that characterizes the current Internet architecture. To this\nend, as a result of a competitive process, four prominent research projects\nwere funded by the NSF in 2010: Nebula, Named-Data Networking (NDN),\nMobilityFirst (MF), and Expressive Internet Architecture (XIA). This paper\nprovides a comprehensive and neutral analysis of salient security and privacy\nfeatures (and issues) in these NSF-funded Future Internet Architectures. It\nalso compares the four candidate designs with the current IP-based architecture\nand discusses similarities, differences, and possible improvements.\n"]}]

For each cluster the pseudo two-color\ndiagram (or `chromosome map') is presented, built with a suitable combination\nof stellar magnitudes in the F275W, F336W, F438W and F814W filters that\nmaximizes the separation between multiple populations. In the chromosome map of\nmost GCs (Type I clusters), stars separate in two distinct groups that we\nidentify with the first (1G) and the second generation (2G). This\nidentification is further supported by noticing that 1G stars have primordial\n(oxygen-rich, sodium-poor) chemical composition, whereas 2G stars are enhanced\nin sodium and depleted in oxygen. This 1G-2G separation is not possible for a\nfew GCs where the two sequences have apparently merged into an extended,\ncontinuous sequence. In some GCs (Type II clusters) the 1G and/or the 2G\nsequences appear to be split, hence displaying more complex chromosome maps.\nThese clusters exhibit multiple SGBs also in purely optical color-magnitude\ndiagrams, with the fainter SGB joining into a red RGB which is populated by\nstars with enhanced heavy-element abundance. We measure the RGB width by using\nappropriate colors and pseudo-colors. When the metallicity dependence is\nremoved, the RGB width correlates with the cluster mass. The fraction of 1G\nstars ranges from ~8% to ~67% and anticorrelates with the cluster mass,\nindicating that incidence and complexity of the multiple population phenomenon\nboth increase with cluster mass.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 24 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Third, on both synthetic data and real-world video data,\nevaluation results show that compared with tensor-nuclear norm minimization\n(TNN-ADMM), Tubal-Alt-Min improves the recovery error dramatically (by orders\nof magnitude). It is estimated that Tubal-Alt-Min converges at an exponential\nrate $10^{-0.4423 \\text{Iter}}$ where $\\text{Iter}$ denotes the number of\niterations, which is much faster than TNN-ADMM's $10^{-0.0332 \\text{Iter}}$,\nand the running time can be accelerated by more than $5$ times for a $200\n\\times 200 \\times 20$ tensor.\n"]}]

We consider a Visual Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem in\nwhich a robot needs to estimate its state using an on-board camera and an\ninertial sensor. The robot can allocate limited resources to VIN, due to time\nand energy constraints. Therefore, we answer the following question: under\nlimited resources, what are the most relevant visual cues to maximize the\nperformance of visual-inertial navigation?

Fourth, it\nprovides formal performance guarantees: we leverage submodularity to prove that\nthe greedy selection cannot be far from the optimal (combinatorial) selection.\nSimulations and real experiments on agile drones show that our approach leads\nto dramatic improvements in the VIN performance.

C. Sabbah shows the existence for every $ x_0 \\in\nX $ of a finite set $ {\\cal H} $ of linear forms with coefficients in $ {\\bf N}\n$, such that: $$ \\prod_{H \\in {\\cal H}} \\prod_{i \\in I_{\\cal H}} (H (s_1,\n\\ldots, s_p) + \\alpha_{H , i}) \\in {\\cal B} (m, x_0, f_1, \\ldots, f_p) \\; , $$\nwhere $\\alpha_{H,i} $ are complex numbers. The purpose of this article is to\nshow in particular the existence of a minimal set $ {\\cal H} $. In addition,\nwhen $ m $ is a section of a holonomic regular ${\\cal D}_X$-Module, we will\nprecise geometrically this set from the characteristic variety of ${\\cal\nD}_X$-Module generated by $m$.

They aim to provide students with a theoretical and numerical\nbackground for the computation of periodic orbits using Newton's method. We\nfocus on periodically perturbed quasi-integrable systems (using the forced\npendulum as an example) and hence we take advantage of the Melnikov method to\nget first guesses.

Periodic orbits are computed by solving a\nfixed-point equation for the stroboscopic map, which is very fast and precise\nfor hyperbolic periodic orbits. However, for non-hyperbolic ones the method\nfails and we use the Poincar\\'e map instead. In both cases we show how to\ncompute the Jacobian of the maps, which is necessary for the Newton method, by\nmeans of variational equations and the implicit function theorem.

The resulting\nalgorithm treats the artifacts as missing data, and the estimated values\noutperform those algorithms that substitute the outliers by a local filtering.\nWe provide code implementations for both Matlab and Gwyddion.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures"]}]

In the\nundirected case we show that for any fixed set $L$, we have\n$c(L,n)=\\Theta_L(n^{\\lfloor k/\\ell \\rfloor})$ where $k$ is the largest element\nof $L$ and $2\\ell$ is the smallest even element of $L$ (if $L$ contains only\nodd elements, then $c(L,n)=\\Theta_L(n)$ holds.) We also give a characterization\nof $L$-cycle graphs when $L$ is a single element.\n  In the directed case we prove that for any fixed set $L$ we have\n$\\vec{c}(L,n)=(1+o(1))(\\frac{n-1}{k-1})^{k-1}$, where $k$ is the largest\nelement of $L$. We determine the exact value of $\\vec{c}(\\{k\\},n)$ for every\n$k$ and characterize all graphs attaining this maximum.\n"]}]

This is a\ncommon approximation in geophysical fluid dynamics and is referred to as\nbeta-plane. In vorticity formulation the model we consider is then given by the\nEuler equation with the addition of a linear anisotropic, non-degenerate,\ndispersive term. This allows us to treat the problem as a quasilinear\ndispersive equation whose linear solutions exhibit decay in time at a critical\nrate.\n  Our main result is the global stability and decay to equilibrium of\nsufficiently small and localized solutions.

A separation in\nquasi-trapped, long lifetime (O(10 s)), and albedo, short life time (O(100\nms)), components is found. The flux maps as a function of the canonical\nadiabatic variables L, alpha0 are determined in the interval\n(L,alpha0)=(0.95-3,0-90) for electrons with E less than 10 GeV, and positrons\nwith E less than 3 GeV. The results are compared with existing data at lower\nenergies and in similar L, alpha0 range. The properties of the observed\nunder-cutoff particles are also investigated in terms of their residence times\nand geographical origin.
