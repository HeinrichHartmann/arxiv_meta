The possibility of dark matter (DM) annihilation explaining both\nsignals through prompt emission at gamma-rays and secondary emission at\nmicrowave frequencies from interactions of high-energy electrons produced in\nannihilation with the Galactic magnetic fields has attracted much interest in\nrecent years. We investigate the DM interpretation of the Galactic Center\ngamma-ray excess by searching for the associated synchrotron in the WMAP-Planck\ndata.

In addition to standard\nmicrowave foregrounds, we separately model the microwave counterpart to the\nFermi Bubbles and the signal due to DM, and use component separation techniques\nto extract the signal associated with each template from the total emission. We\nconfirm the presence of the Haze at the level of 7% of the total sky intensity\nat 23GHz in our chosen region of interest, with a harder spectrum $I \\sim\n\\nu^{-0.8}$ than the synchrotron from regular cosmic-ray electrons.

We calculate the \"one-way\" static\nShapiro delay for the first discovered millisecond pulsar PSR~B1937+21, by\nincluding the contributions from both the dark matter and baryonic matter\nbetween this pulsar and the Earth. We find a value of approximately 5 days (of\nwhich 4.74 days is from the dark matter and 0.22 days from the baryonic\nmatter). We also calculate the modulation of Shapiro delay from the motion of a\nsingle dark matter halo, and also evaluate the cumulative effects of the motion\nof matter distribution on the change in pulsar's period and its derivative. The\ntime-dependent effects are too small to be detected with the current timing\nnoise observed for this pulsar. Finally, we would like to emphasize that\nalthough the one-way Shapiro delay is mostly of academic interest for\nelectromagnetic astronomy, its ubiquity should not be forgotten in the era of\nmulti-messenger astronomy.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures"]}]

For any\nconnector $T$, a morphism between species, any experimental setting $E$ of its\ntarget species there exists a set such that with each of its elements $s$\nremains associated an experimental setting $T[E,s]$ of its source species,\n$T[\\cdot,s]$ is called charge associated with $T$ and $s$. The vertical\ncomposition of connectors is controvariantly represented in terms of charge\ncomposition. The horizontal composition of connectors and $2-$cells of\n$2-\\mathfrak{dp}$ is represented in terms of charge transfer. A collection of\ntrajectories induced by $T[E,s]$ corresponds to a collection of trajectories\ninduced by $E$ (equiformity principle). Context categories, species and\nconnectors are organized respectively as $0,1$ and $2$ cells of\n$2-\\mathfrak{dp}$ with factorizable functors via $\\mathfrak{dp}$ as $1-$cells\nand as $2-$cells, arranged themself to form objects of categories, natural\ntransformations between $1-$cells obtained as horizontal composition of natural\ntransformations between the corresponding factors.....\n","Comment: 68 pages, Improved and added new results in section 1.6.2, added a\n  comment after Proposition 1.4.42, added references"]}]

CUORE-0 is a bolometric detector array located at the\nLaboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso that was designed to validate the\nbackground reduction techniques developed for CUORE, a next-generation\nexperiment scheduled to come online in 2016. CUORE-0 is also a competitive\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay search in its own right and functions as a platform to\nfurther develop the analysis tools and procedures to be used in CUORE. These\ninclude data collection, event selection and processing, as well as an\nevaluation of signal efficiency. In particular, we describe the amplitude\nevaluation, thermal gain stabilization, energy calibration methods, and the\nanalysis event selection used to create our final $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay search\nspectrum. We define our high level analysis procedures, with emphasis on the\nnew insights gained and challenges encountered. We outline in detail our\nfitting methods near the hypothesized $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay peak and catalog\nthe main sources of systematic uncertainty. Finally, we derive the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay half-life limits previously reported for CUORE-0,\n$T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}>2.7\\times10^{24}$ yr, and in combination with the Cuoricino\nlimit, $T^{0\\nu}_{1/2}>4.0\\times10^{24}$ yr.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 18 figures.

The\nM-FFC flexibility also permits the self-cross convolution amongst Gabor filters\nand other filter banks of profoundly dissimilar traits, e.g., principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) filters, and independent component analysis (ICA)\nfilters, in our case. A 2-FFC instance therefore yields three offspring sets\nfrom: (1) Gabor filters solely, (2) Gabor and PCA filters, and (3) Gabor and\nICA filters, to render the learning-free and the learning-based 2-FFC\ndescriptors. To facilitate a sensible Gabor filter selection for M-FFC, the 40\nmulti-scale, multi-orientation Gabor filters is condensed into 8 elementary\nfilters.

They argued that there is a single underlying visual ability, v,\nthat is expressed in performance with both face and nonface categories as\nexperience grows. Using the Cambridge Face Memory Test and the Vanderbilt\nExpertise Test, they showed that the shared variance between Cambridge Face\nMemory Test and Vanderbilt Expertise Test performance increases monotonically\nas experience increases.

We explain this conundrum using our\nneurocomputational model of face and object processing (The Model, TM). Our\nresults show that, as in the behavioral data, the correlation between\nsubordinate level face and object recognition accuracy increases as experience\ngrows. We suggest that different domains do not compete for resources because\nthe relevant features are shared between faces and objects. The essential power\nof experience is to generate a \"spreading transform\" for faces that generalizes\nto objects that must be individuated. Interestingly, when the task of the\nnetwork is basic level categorization, no increase in the correlation between\ndomains is observed. Hence, our model predicts that it is the type of\nexperience that matters and that the source of the correlation is in the\nfusiform face area, rather than in cortical areas that subserve basic level\ncategorization.

We use optically trapped\nmicrosphere probes of 2-10 microns, to induce oscillatory strains and measure\nmucus stress response. We show that viscoelastic properties are highly\ndependent on the strain scale (l) with three distinct regimes emerging:\nmicroscale: l_1<4 microns, mesoscale: l_2~4-10 microns, and macroscale: l_3>10\nmicrons. While mucus response is similar to water for l_1 indicating that\nprobes rarely contact the mucus mesh, for l_2 the response is distinctly more\nviscous and independent of probe size, demonstrating that the mucus behaves as\na continuum. However, this principally viscous mesoscale response is distinct\nfrom the largely elastic macroscopic mucus response. Only for l_3 does the\nresponse mimic macroscopic elasticity, with rigid constraints strongly\nresisting microsphere displacement. Our results demonstrate that a uniform mesh\nmodel for mucus with a single lengthscale modulating the crossover from\nwater-like to elastic is too simplistic. Rather, the mucus responds as a\nhierarchical network with a loose microscopic mesh controlling mechanics for\nl_2, coupled with a mesoscale rigid scaffold responsible for the macroscopic\ngel-like mechanics beyond l_3.

Focusing on image denoising, we\nderive an optimal metric space assuming nonlocal self-similarity of pixel\npatches, leading to an optimal graph Laplacian regularizer for denoising in the\ndiscrete domain. We then interpret graph Laplacian regularization as an\nanisotropic diffusion scheme to explain its behavior during iterations, e.g.,\nits tendency to promote piecewise smooth signals under certain settings. To\nverify our analysis, an iterative image denoising algorithm is developed.\nExperimental results show that our algorithm performs competitively with\nstate-of-the-art denoising methods such as BM3D for natural images, and\noutperforms them significantly for piecewise smooth images.\n"]}]

The latter discrepancy could originate from high extinction by the outflow\ncavity of the western side, these discrepancies or may indicate that the\noutflow axis is not parallel to the rotation axis of the envelope.\nPosition-velocity diagrams show the accelerated outflow cavity wall, and its\nkinematic structure in the 2000 AU scale is explained by a standard parabolic\nmodel with the inclination angle derived from the analysis of the envelope. The\ndifferent orientation of the outflow between the small and large scale implies\na possibility of precession of the outflow axis. The shape and the velocity of\nthe outflow in the vicinity of the protostar are compared with those of other\nprotostars.\n"]}]

A common trait of these processes is that the mixing interface is\nstrained by shear. Depending on the P\\'eclet number $Pe$, which represents the\nratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic advection\ntime, and the Damk\\\"ohler number $Da$, which represents the ratio of the\ncharacteristic diffusion time to the characteristic reaction time, the local\nreaction rates can be strongly impacted by the dynamics of the mixing\ninterface.

In order to build these high\nlevel models it is paramount to have a battery of robust and reliable low and\nmid level cues. Along these lines, we have proposed two low-level keypoint\ndescriptors: one based on the theory of the heat diffusion on images, and the\nother that uses a convolutional neural network to learn discriminative image\npatch representations. We also introduce distinct low-level generative models\nfor representing human pose: in particular we present a discrete model based on\na directed acyclic graph and a continuous model that consists of poses\nclustered on a Riemannian manifold. As mid level cues we propose two 3D human\npose estimation algorithms: one that estimates the 3D pose given a noisy 2D\nestimation, and an approach that simultaneously estimates both the 2D and 3D\npose. Finally, we formulate higher level models built upon low and mid level\ncues for understanding humans from single images. Concretely, we focus on two\ndifferent tasks in the context of fashion: semantic segmentation of clothing,\nand predicting the fashionability from images with metadata to ultimately\nprovide fashion advice to the user.
