More\nspecifically, at high redshift (z~5), the mean central density profiles of\nH_AGN and H_noAGN dark matter haloes tend to be much steeper than their H_DM\ncounterparts owing to the rapidly growing baryonic component and ensuing\nadiabatic contraction. By z~1.5, these mean halo density profiles in H_AGN have\nflattened, pummelled by powerful AGN activity (\"quasar mode\"): the integrated\ninner mass difference gaps with H_noAGN haloes have widened, and those with\nH_DM haloes have narrowed. Fast forward 9.5 billion years, down to z=0, and the\ntrend reverses: H_AGN halo mean density profiles drift back to a more cusped\nshape as AGN feedback efficiency dwindles (\"radio mode\"), and the gaps in\nintegrated central mass difference with H_noAGN and H_DM close and broaden\nrespectively. On the galaxy side, the story differs noticeably. Averaged\nstellar profile central densities and inner slopes are monotonically reduced by\nAGN activity as a function of cosmic time, resulting in better agreement with\nlocal observations.

These sets are\nknown to be the main culprits in the error floor region of such codes. The\ncharacterization of ETSs for irregular codes has been known to be a challenging\nproblem due to the large variety of non-isomorphic ETS structures that can\nexist within the Tanner graph of these codes. This is a direct consequence of\nthe variety of the degrees of the variable nodes that can participate in such\nstructures. The proposed characterization is based on a hierarchical graphical\nrepresentation of ETSs, starting from simple cycles of the graph, or from\nsingle variable nodes, and involves three simple expansion techniques:\ndegree-one tree ($dot$), $path$ and $lollipop$, thus, the terminology {\\em dpl\ncharacterization}. A similar dpl characterization was proposed in an earlier\nwork by the authors for the leafless ETSs (LETSs) of variable-regular LDPC\ncodes. The present paper generalizes the prior work to codes with a variety of\nvariable node degrees and to ETSs that are not leafless. The proposed dpl\ncharacterization corresponds to an efficient search algorithm that, for a given\nirregular LDPC code, can find all the instances of $(a,b)$ ETSs with size $a$\nand with the number of unsatisfied check nodes $b$ within any range of interest\n$a \\leq a_{max}$ and $b \\leq b_{max}$, exhaustively. Although, (brute force)\nexhaustive search algorithms for ETSs of irregular LDPC codes exist, to the\nbest of our knowledge, the proposed search algorithm is the first of its kind,\nin that, it is devised based on a characterization of ETSs that makes the\nsearch process efficient. Extensive simulation results are presented to show\nthe versatility of the search algorithm, and to demonstrate that, compared to\nthe literature, significant improvement in search speed can be obtained.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1510.04954"]}]

Although there is not a general consensus among\nresearchers yet, many studies point that scale-free topologies, where few\nhighly related firms are combined with many low-related firms, assure the\nhighest efficiency of a supply chain. This paper studies the network topology\nthat leads to the highest agility of the supply chain when sudden demand\nchanges occur. To do this, an agent-based model of a supply chain with\nrestricted relationship between agents is built. The model includes three\ntiers, where the flow of material is distributed from the bottom supplier to\nthe final customer passing necessarily through firms in every tier. Agility is\nmeasured in the model simulations through the order fulfillment rate. Unlike to\nprevious theoretical and lab results, the simulation of the model shows that\nthe highest levels of agility are not obtained with a scale-free topology.\nInstead, homogeneous distribution of links, such as those induced by regular or\nPoisson probability laws, shows higher agility values than heterogeneous\ndistributions. Other previous recommendations, such as redundancy or having\nmultiple suppliers, are confirmed by the simulations. The general conclusion is\nthat the most suitable network topology in terms of agility depends on the\nspecific conditions of the supply chain and the aspects of the performance to\nbe analyzed.\n"]}]

This turns out to be potentially advantageous for\nmeasuring low temperatures, as we show that: (i) The thermometric precision at\nlow $ T $ can be significantly enhanced by strengthening the probe-sampling\ncoupling, (ii) the variance of a suitable quadrature of our single-mode\nthermometer can yield temperature estimates with nearly minimal statistical\nuncertainty, and (iii) the spectral density of the probe-sample coupling may be\nengineered to further improve thermometric performance. These observations may\nfind applications in practical nanoscale thermometry at low temperatures---a\nregime which is particularly relevant to quantum technologies.\n","Comment: 6+7 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Firstly, a fully convolutional network (FCN) is trained\nto generate response maps of all facial landmark points. Such a data-driven\nmethod can make full use of holistic information in a facial image for global\nestimation of facial landmarks. Secondly, the maximum points in the response\nmaps are fitted with a pre-trained point distribution model (PDM) to generate\ninitial facial landmark shape. Such a model-driven method can correct the\nlocation errors of outliers by considering shape prior information. Thirdly, a\nweighted version of Regularized Landmark Mean-Shift (RLMS) is proposed to\nfine-tune facial landmark shapes iteratively.

Code obfuscation is a contentious issue.\nTheoretical code analysis techniques indicate that, attaining a verifiable and\nsecure obfuscation is impossible. However, obfuscation tools and techniques are\npopular both among malware developers (to evade anti-malware) and commercial\nsoftware developers (protect intellectual rights). We conducted a survey to\nuncover answers to concrete and relevant questions concerning Android code\nobfuscation and protection techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review\ncode obfuscation and code protection practices, and evaluate efficacy of\nexisting code de-obfuscation tools. In particular, we discuss Android code\nobfuscation methods, custom app protection techniques, and various\nde-obfuscation methods. Furthermore, we review and analyse the obfuscation\ntechniques used by malware authors to evade analysis efforts. We believe that,\nthere is a need to investigate efficiency of the defense techniques used for\ncode protection. This survey would be beneficial to the researchers and\npractitioners, to understand obfuscation and de-obfuscation techniques to\npropose novel solutions on Android.\n"]}]

However, this task is challenging due to the non-convex\nnature of the matching metric over the plausible registration parameter space\nand insufficient approaches for a robust optimization. As a result, current\napproaches are often customized to a specific problem and sensitive to image\nquality and artifacts. In this paper, we propose a completely different\napproach to image registration, inspired by how experts perform the task. We\nfirst cast the image registration problem as a \"strategy learning\" process,\nwhere the goal is to find the best sequence of motion actions (e.g. up, down,\netc.) that yields image alignment. Within this approach, an artificial agent is\nlearned, modeled using deep convolutional neural networks, with 3D raw image\ndata as the input, and the next optimal action as the output. To cope with the\ndimensionality of the problem, we propose a greedy supervised approach for an\nend-to-end training, coupled with attention-driven hierarchical strategy. The\nresulting registration approach inherently encodes both a data-driven matching\nmetric and an optimal registration strategy (policy). We demonstrate, on two\n3-D/3-D medical image registration examples with drastically different nature\nof challenges, that the artificial agent outperforms several state-of-art\nregistration methods by a large margin in terms of both accuracy and\nrobustness.\n","Comment: To appear in AAAI Conference 2017"]}]

One of the core challenges\nassociated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the\nunderlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations\ncould lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On\nthe other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In\nthis paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees\nfor learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank\nstructural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied\nto a potentially non-convex constraint set $\\Theta$ in terms of its\n\\emph{localized Gaussian width}. We juxtapose our theoretical results for\nnon-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on\nregularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and\nnon-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the\nnon-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has\ndesirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical upper bound\nperspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of\nexamples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which\naddress these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and\nconvex approaches.
