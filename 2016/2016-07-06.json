These results are employed to discuss the\nmodel of binary mixture consisting of the alpha-stable chains. On what follows,\nwe establish the spinodal decomposition condition generalized to the particles\ndescribed by the shape of alpha-stable distributions. This condition is finally\napplied to analyze the on-surface phase separation of adsorbed polymers, which\nare known to be described with heavy tailed statistics.\n","Comment: Complete version prepared for submission to Phys.

Unlike\ngames like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill\ngame' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem,\nwhose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal\nwinning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a\nstrategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore,\nin order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances\nof rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges.

In this study we analyze a simple model of poker\nchallenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the\nnature of this game.

Therefore, although\nrationality is a key ingredient to succeed in poker, also the format of\nchallenges has an important role in these dynamics, as it can strongly\ninfluence the underlying nature of the game.

The second description is accessed via an\nelectric-magnetic duality of the bulk TI coupled to a gauge field, which maps\nit to a gauged topological superconductor. This alternate description\nultimately leads to a new surface theory - dual QED3. The dual theory provides\nan explicit derivation of the T-Pfaffian state, a proposed surface topological\norder of the TI, which is simply the paired superfluid state of the dual\nfermions. The roles of time reversal and particle-hole symmetry are exchanged\nby the duality, which connects some of our results to a recent conjecture by\nSon on particle-hole symmetric quantum Hall states.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 pages appendices, 1 figure"]}]

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii and receding shock\nfronts after the passage through their maxima, our models exhibit short\nadvection time scales, which favor the efficient growth of the standing\naccretion-shock instability.

Upcoming weak lensing surveys that use these detectors, such as WFIRST,\nplace stringent requirements on the PSF size and shape (and the level at which\nthese are known), which in turn must be translated into requirements on IPC. To\nfacilitate this process, we present a first study of the effect of IPC on\nWFIRST PSF sizes and shapes. Realistic PSFs are forward-simulated from physical\nprinciples for each WFIRST bandpass. We explore how the PSF size and shape\ndepends on the range of IPC coupling with pixels that are connected along an\nedge or corner; for the expected level of IPC in WFIRST, IPC increases the PSF\nsizes by $\\sim$5\\%.

In open systems OLC is mediated by a\nmicroscale vortical flow which develops as a result of electroconvective\ninstability (ECI) of quiescent CP near LC. Electroconvection (EC) is a flow\ndriven by the electric force acting either upon the space charge of the\ninterfacial EDL (electroosmosis, EO) or the residual space charge of the\nquasielectroneutral bulk (bulk EC). There are two types of EO, the equilibrium\nand the nonequilibrium one. The former relates to the action of the tangential\nelectric field upon the space charge of the EDL, and the latter pertains to the\nsimilar action upon the extended space charge, forming next to the EDL near LC.\nFor a perfectly charge-selective interface, CP is stable under the equilibrium\nEO or bulk EC, but nonequilibrium EO may cause ECI.

The mechanism for this is that the\nlinearized Yang-Mills equations in the background of the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om\n(RN) black holes possess a normalizable zero mode, resulting in non-Abelian\n(nA) magnetic clouds near the horizon. In this work we show that the same\npattern may occur also for asymptotically flat RN black holes. Different from\nthe anti-de Sitter case, in the Minkowskian background the prerequisite for the\nexistence of the nA clouds is $i)$ a large enough gauge group and $ii)$ the\npresence of some extra interaction terms in the matter Lagrangian. To\nillustrate this mechanism we present two specific examples, one in four and the\nother in five dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. In the first case, we\naugment the usual $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills Lagrangian with higher order (quartic)\ncurvature term, while for the second one we add the Chern-Simons density to the\n$SO(6)$ Yang-Mills system. In both cases, an Abelian gauge symmetry is\nspontaneously broken near a RN black hole horizon with the appearance of a\ncondensate of nA gauge fields. In addition to these two examples, we review the\ncorresponding picture for anti-de Sitter black holes. All these solutions are\nstudied both analytically and numerically, existence proofs being provided for\nnA clouds in the background of RN black holes. The proofs use shooting\ntechniques which are suggested by and in turn offer insights for our numerical\nmethods.

The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is a\ntypical strong coupling theory with the non-zero critical coupling, in sharp\ncontrast to its precedent model, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory for the\nsuperconductor. The non-zero critical coupling is also hidden in the\nasymptotically free gauge theories including QCD and walking technicolor. As is\nwell known, the NJL model can be cast into the SM Higgs Lagrangian.

We also\ndemonstrate the use of the Ca II H and K residual core flux as a proxy for the\nstellar activity level throughout the transit. A moderate trend is found\nbetween the pre-transit absorption signal in the 2013 data and the Ca II H\nflux. This suggests that some of the 2013 pre-transit hydrogen absorption can\nbe attributed to varying stellar activity levels. A very weak correlation is\nfound between the Ca II H core flux and the Balmer line absorption in the 2015\ntransit, hinting at a smaller contribution from stellar activity compared to\nthe 2013 transit. We simulate how varying stellar activity levels can produce\nchanges in the Balmer line transmission spectra. These simulations show that\nthe strength of the 2013 and 2015 pre-transit signals can be reproduced by\nstellar variability. If the pre-transit signature is attributed to\ncircumplanetary material, its evolution in time can be described by accretion\nclumps spiraling towards the star, although this interpretation has serious\nlimitations.

For this purpose we use public data from the MOJAVE\ncollaboration in which we select a sample of blazars with known redshift and\nsufficient monitoring to constrain apparent velocities. We selected 161 blazars\nfrom a sample of 200 sources. We identify three distinct classes of VLBI jets\ndepending on radio knot kinematics: class I with quasi-stationary knots, class\nII with knots in relativistic motion from the radio core, and class I/II,\nintermediate, showing quasi-stationary knots at the jet base and relativistic\nmotions downstream. A notable result is the good overlap of this kinematic\nclassification with the usual spectral classification; class I corresponds to\nHBLs, class II to FSRQs, and class I/II to IBLs/LBLs. We deepen this study by\ncharacterizing the physical parameters of jets from VLBI radio data. Hence we\nfocus on the singular case of the class I/II by the study of the blazar BL Lac\nitself.

We characterize the overall nature of the absorbers by\ncorrelating Ti/Ca with other observables (e.g., metallicity, velocity-component\nstructure) and by modeling the ionization properties of singly-ionized Ca and\nTi in different environments. We conclude that CaII and TiII bearing\nabsorption-line systems trace predominantly neutral gas in the disks and inner\nhalo regions of galaxies, where the abundance of Ca and Ti reflects the local\nmetal and dust content of the gas.

Multiple lines of geologic\nevidence now point to an episodically warm surface during the late Noachian and\nearly Hesperian periods 3-4 Ga. The low solar flux received by Mars in its\nfirst billion years and inefficiency of plausible greenhouse gases such as CO2\nmeans that the steady-state early Martian climate was likely cold. A denser CO2\natmosphere would have caused adiabatic cooling of the surface and hence\nmigration of water ice to the higher altitude equatorial and southern regions\nof the planet. Transient warming caused melting of snow and ice deposits and a\ntemporarily active hydrological cycle, leading to erosion of the valley\nnetworks and other fluvial features. Precise details of the warming mechanisms\nremain unclear, but impacts, volcanism and orbital forcing all likely played an\nimportant role. The lack of evidence for glaciation across much of Mars'\nancient terrain suggests the late Noachian surface water inventory was not\nsufficient to sustain a northern ocean.

Using the spectroscopic data\nwe computed time-resolved Doppler tomograms of the system demonstrating its\nbehavior at different orbital phases. In the tomograms one can see the periodic\nbrightening of different regions within one orbital cycle. We interpret this\nbrightening as being due to the interaction of four phase-locked shock waves in\nthe disk with a specific internal precessing density wave that develops inside\nthe disk, because of the tidal influence of the secondary star, and this\ndensity wave propagates up to the disk's outer regions. When the outer part of\nthe density wave in its precessional motion reaches a shock wave the local\ndensity grows, which amplifies the shock (by increasing $\\rho V^{2}/2$). This\nresults in an additional energy release in the shock and can be observed as a\nbrightening. Analysis of the tomographic results and the photometric data shows\nthat two main sources contribute to the light curves of the system: the\nradiation of the \"hot line\" and the bow-shock gives us two major orbital humps,\nlocated approximately at the orbital phases $\\phi=0.25$ and $\\phi=0.75$; the\namplification of the four shock waves may give us up to four \"superhumps\"\nshifting over the light curve with the precessional period.

This approach allows us to identify the\nregime where the inflationary field range is uniquely determined by both the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio and the spectral index.

This process iterates (typically\n2-3 times), and each time the system revises the top ranked proposal set, until\nthe user is satisfied with a resulting segmentation mask. Finally, the mask is\npropagated across the video to produce a spatio-temporal object tube. On three\nchallenging datasets, we provide extensive comparisons with both existing work\nand simpler alternative methods. In all, the proposed Click Carving approach\nstrikes an excellent balance of accuracy and human effort. It outperforms all\nsimilarly fast methods, and is competitive or better than those requiring 2 to\n12 times the effort.\n","Comment: A preliminary version of the material in this document was filed as\n  University of Texas technical report no.

In this research work,\nauthors proposed and designed a novel architecture for e-learning system\nincorporating cultural diversity of learners. The focus is to concentrate on\ncultural factors from e-learning system. Furthermore; a prototype of the\nproposed system is implemented for the validation of proposed architecture.\n","Comment: This paper has been published in Conference: 11th WSEAS International\n  Conference on Education and Educational Technology (EDU '12). arXiv admin\n  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1605.01580"]}]

The general expansion to the second order is derived.\nThe second order expansion is considered as a small correction to the first\norder expansion. Using this approach it is demonstrated that the second order\nexpansion is reducible to a first order expansion via a re-definition of the\nfirst order pertubative fields. Even if in practice the second order correction\nis small the reducibility of the second order expansion to the first order\nexpansion indicates a degeneracy problem. In general this degeneracy is hard to\nbreak. A useful and simple second order approximation is the thin source\napproximation which offers a direct estimation of the correction. The practical\napplication of the corrections derived in this paper are illustrated by using\nan elliptical NFW lens model. The second order pertubative expansion provides a\nnoticeable improvement, even for the simplest case of thin source\napproximation. To conclude it is clear that for accurate modelisation of\ngravitational lenses using the perturbative method the second order\nperturbative expansion should be considered.
