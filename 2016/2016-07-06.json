Further, we derive the distribution of segments around the mass\ncenter of the alpha-stable chain and the coarse-grained interaction potential\nbetween two chains is constructed. These results are employed to discuss the\nmodel of binary mixture consisting of the alpha-stable chains. On what follows,\nwe establish the spinodal decomposition condition generalized to the particles\ndescribed by the shape of alpha-stable distributions. This condition is finally\napplied to analyze the on-surface phase separation of adsorbed polymers, which\nare known to be described with heavy tailed statistics.\n","Comment: Complete version prepared for submission to Phys.

Unlike\ngames like chess, the task of classifying the nature of poker (i.e., as 'skill\ngame' or gambling) seems really hard and it also constitutes a current problem,\nwhose solution has several implications. In general, gambling offers equal\nwinning probabilities both to rational players (i.e., those that use a\nstrategy) and to irrational ones (i.e., those without a strategy). Therefore,\nin order to uncover the nature of poker, a viable way is comparing performances\nof rational versus irrational players during a series of challenges.

In this study we analyze a simple model of poker\nchallenges by a statistical physics approach, with the aim to uncover the\nnature of this game.

The second description is accessed via an\nelectric-magnetic duality of the bulk TI coupled to a gauge field, which maps\nit to a gauged topological superconductor. This alternate description\nultimately leads to a new surface theory - dual QED3. The dual theory provides\nan explicit derivation of the T-Pfaffian state, a proposed surface topological\norder of the TI, which is simply the paired superfluid state of the dual\nfermions. The roles of time reversal and particle-hole symmetry are exchanged\nby the duality, which connects some of our results to a recent conjecture by\nSon on particle-hole symmetric quantum Hall states.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 pages appendices, 1 figure"]}]

In this paper, we\npoint to an important effect that has been ignored or considered insignificant\nwhile interpreting these new high-frequency radio data, namely the\ncontamination due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect that changes the\nobserved synchrotron flux.

All models develop explosions, but depending on the progenitor\nstructure, they can be divided into two classes. With a steep density decline\nat the Si/Si-O interface, the arrival of this interface at the shock front\nleads to a sudden drop of the mass-accretion rate, triggering a rapid approach\nto explosion. With a more gradually decreasing accretion rate, it takes longer\nfor the neutrino heating to overcome the accretion ram pressure and explosions\nset in later. Early explosions are facilitated by high mass-accretion rates\nafter bounce and correspondingly high neutrino luminosities combined with a\npronounced drop of the accretion rate and ram pressure at the Si/Si-O\ninterface. Because of rapidly shrinking neutron star radii and receding shock\nfronts after the passage through their maxima, our models exhibit short\nadvection time scales, which favor the efficient growth of the standing\naccretion-shock instability. The latter plays a supportive role at least for\nthe initiation of the re-expansion of the stalled shock before runaway.

More\nspecifically, the compiler discovers read/write dependencies between arrays and\ntranslates one-big-switch programs into an efficient internal representation\nbased on a novel variant of binary decision diagrams. This internal\nrepresentation is used to construct a mixed-integer linear program, which\njointly optimizes the placement of state and the routing of traffic across the\nunderlying physical topology. We have implemented a prototype compiler and\napplied it to about 20 SNAP programs over various topologies to demonstrate our\ntechniques' scalability.\n"]}]

More generally, we find that such asymmetric\nstructures should be ubiquitous about pairs of dwarfs and can persist for 1-2\nGyr even after the secondary merges entirely with the primary. As such, the\nlack of a companion around a Magellanic Irregular does not disprove the\nhypothesis that their asymmetric structures are driven by dwarf-dwarf\ninteractions.\n","Comment: Submitted to ApJ.

Thus, the coupled processes of orbital evolution and RLO likely shape\nthe observed distribution of close-in exoplanets and may even be responsible\nfor producing some of the short-period rocky planets. However, the exact\noutcome for an overflowing planet depends on its internal response to mass\nloss, and the accompanying orbital evolution can act to enhance or inhibit RLO.\nIn this study, we apply the fully-featured and robust Modules for Experiments\nin Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) suite to model RLO of short-period gaseous\nplanets. We show that, although the detailed evolution may depend on several\nproperties of the planetary system, it is largely determined by the core mass\nof the overflowing gas giant. In particular, we find that the orbital expansion\nthat accompanies RLO often stops and reverses at a specific maximum period that\ndepends on the core mass.

To the extent that we can establish some\nshort-period planets are indeed the remnants of gas giants, that population can\nelucidate the properties of gas giant cores, the properties of which remain\nlargely unconstrained.\n","Comment: Accepted to \"Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy\" special\n  issue on tides.

In this work we show that the same\npattern may occur also for asymptotically flat RN black holes.

To\nillustrate this mechanism we present two specific examples, one in four and the\nother in five dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime. In the first case, we\naugment the usual $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills Lagrangian with higher order (quartic)\ncurvature term, while for the second one we add the Chern-Simons density to the\n$SO(6)$ Yang-Mills system.

All these solutions are\nstudied both analytically and numerically, existence proofs being provided for\nnA clouds in the background of RN black holes. The proofs use shooting\ntechniques which are suggested by and in turn offer insights for our numerical\nmethods.

The Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model is a\ntypical strong coupling theory with the non-zero critical coupling, in sharp\ncontrast to its precedent model, the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory for the\nsuperconductor. The non-zero critical coupling is also hidden in the\nasymptotically free gauge theories including QCD and walking technicolor. As is\nwell known, the NJL model can be cast into the SM Higgs Lagrangian. We show\nthat the SM Higgs Lagrangian is simply rewritten into a form of the\n(approximately) scale-invariant nonlinear sigma model, with both the chiral\nsymmetry and scale symmetry realized nonlinearly, with the SM Higgs being\nnothing but the (pseudo-) dilaton. The SM Higgs Lagrangian is further gauge\nequivalent to the scale-invariant Hidden Local Symmetry (HLS) Lagrangian,\ns-HLS, having spin 1 bosons hidden in the SM. As the simplest possible\nunderlying theory for the SM Higgs Lagrangian we first discuss the top quark\ncondensate (\"top-mode SM\"), where the top-mode dilaton is the 125 GeV Higgs.

We also\ndemonstrate the use of the Ca II H and K residual core flux as a proxy for the\nstellar activity level throughout the transit. A moderate trend is found\nbetween the pre-transit absorption signal in the 2013 data and the Ca II H\nflux. This suggests that some of the 2013 pre-transit hydrogen absorption can\nbe attributed to varying stellar activity levels. A very weak correlation is\nfound between the Ca II H core flux and the Balmer line absorption in the 2015\ntransit, hinting at a smaller contribution from stellar activity compared to\nthe 2013 transit. We simulate how varying stellar activity levels can produce\nchanges in the Balmer line transmission spectra. These simulations show that\nthe strength of the 2013 and 2015 pre-transit signals can be reproduced by\nstellar variability. If the pre-transit signature is attributed to\ncircumplanetary material, its evolution in time can be described by accretion\nclumps spiraling towards the star, although this interpretation has serious\nlimitations.

For this purpose we use public data from the MOJAVE\ncollaboration in which we select a sample of blazars with known redshift and\nsufficient monitoring to constrain apparent velocities. We selected 161 blazars\nfrom a sample of 200 sources. We identify three distinct classes of VLBI jets\ndepending on radio knot kinematics: class I with quasi-stationary knots, class\nII with knots in relativistic motion from the radio core, and class I/II,\nintermediate, showing quasi-stationary knots at the jet base and relativistic\nmotions downstream. A notable result is the good overlap of this kinematic\nclassification with the usual spectral classification; class I corresponds to\nHBLs, class II to FSRQs, and class I/II to IBLs/LBLs. We deepen this study by\ncharacterizing the physical parameters of jets from VLBI radio data. Hence we\nfocus on the singular case of the class I/II by the study of the blazar BL Lac\nitself.

Multiple lines of geologic\nevidence now point to an episodically warm surface during the late Noachian and\nearly Hesperian periods 3-4 Ga. The low solar flux received by Mars in its\nfirst billion years and inefficiency of plausible greenhouse gases such as CO2\nmeans that the steady-state early Martian climate was likely cold. A denser CO2\natmosphere would have caused adiabatic cooling of the surface and hence\nmigration of water ice to the higher altitude equatorial and southern regions\nof the planet. Transient warming caused melting of snow and ice deposits and a\ntemporarily active hydrological cycle, leading to erosion of the valley\nnetworks and other fluvial features. Precise details of the warming mechanisms\nremain unclear, but impacts, volcanism and orbital forcing all likely played an\nimportant role.

Using the spectroscopic data\nwe computed time-resolved Doppler tomograms of the system demonstrating its\nbehavior at different orbital phases. In the tomograms one can see the periodic\nbrightening of different regions within one orbital cycle. We interpret this\nbrightening as being due to the interaction of four phase-locked shock waves in\nthe disk with a specific internal precessing density wave that develops inside\nthe disk, because of the tidal influence of the secondary star, and this\ndensity wave propagates up to the disk's outer regions. When the outer part of\nthe density wave in its precessional motion reaches a shock wave the local\ndensity grows, which amplifies the shock (by increasing $\\rho V^{2}/2$). This\nresults in an additional energy release in the shock and can be observed as a\nbrightening. Analysis of the tomographic results and the photometric data shows\nthat two main sources contribute to the light curves of the system: the\nradiation of the \"hot line\" and the bow-shock gives us two major orbital humps,\nlocated approximately at the orbital phases $\\phi=0.25$ and $\\phi=0.75$; the\namplification of the four shock waves may give us up to four \"superhumps\"\nshifting over the light curve with the precessional period.

In this research work,\nauthors proposed and designed a novel architecture for e-learning system\nincorporating cultural diversity of learners. The focus is to concentrate on\ncultural factors from e-learning system. Furthermore; a prototype of the\nproposed system is implemented for the validation of proposed architecture.\n","Comment: This paper has been published in Conference: 11th WSEAS International\n  Conference on Education and Educational Technology (EDU '12). arXiv admin\n  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1605.01580"]}]

The general expansion to the second order is derived.\nThe second order expansion is considered as a small correction to the first\norder expansion. Using this approach it is demonstrated that the second order\nexpansion is reducible to a first order expansion via a re-definition of the\nfirst order pertubative fields. Even if in practice the second order correction\nis small the reducibility of the second order expansion to the first order\nexpansion indicates a degeneracy problem. In general this degeneracy is hard to\nbreak. A useful and simple second order approximation is the thin source\napproximation which offers a direct estimation of the correction. The practical\napplication of the corrections derived in this paper are illustrated by using\nan elliptical NFW lens model. The second order pertubative expansion provides a\nnoticeable improvement, even for the simplest case of thin source\napproximation. To conclude it is clear that for accurate modelisation of\ngravitational lenses using the perturbative method the second order\nperturbative expansion should be considered.
