In their original work, Jimbo, Miwa, Ueno did not derive the\ndependence on the (generalized) monodromy data (i.e. monodromy representation\nand Stokes' parameters). We fill the gap by providing a (simpler and more\ngeneral) description in which all the parameters of the problem\n(monodromy-changing and monodromy-preserving) are dealt with at the same level.\nWe thus provide variational formulae for the isomonodromic tau function with\nrespect to the (generalized) monodromy data. The construction applies more\ngenerally: given any (sufficiently well-behaved) family of Riemann-Hilbert\nproblems (RHP) where the jump matrices depend arbitrarily on deformation\nparameters, we can construct a one-form Omega (not necessarily closed) on the\ndeformation space (Malgrange's differential), defined off Malgrange's divisor.\nWe then introduce the notion of discrete Schlesinger transformation: it means\nthat we allow the solution of the RHP to have poles (or zeros) at prescribed\npoint(s).

As a function of the\nposition of the points of the Schlesinger transformation, yields a natural\ngeneralization of Sato formula for the Baker-Akhiezer vector even in the\nabsence of a tau function, and it realizes the solution of the RHP as such BA\nvector.

Using this sample we\nestimate the redshift-dependent GRB rate density, showing it to peak at z~2.5\nand fall by about an order of magnitude towards low (z=0) redshift, while\ndeclining more gradually towards high (z~7) redshift. This behavior is\nconsistent with a progenitor whose formation efficiency varies modestly over\ncosmic history.

Three (SDSS J1426+5752,\nSDSS J2200-0741, and SDSS J2348-0942) were known to be variable.

It\nturns out that the mother body measure $\\mu_*$ displays a novel phase\ntransition that we call the mother body phase transition: although $\\partial\n\\Omega$ evolves analytically, the mother body measure undergoes a \"one-cut to\nthree-cut\" phase transition.\n  To construct the mother body measure, we define a quadratic differential\n$\\varpi$ on the associated spectral curve, and embed $\\mu_*$ into its critical\ngraph.

Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry\nbreaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of\nincipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain\nwhy the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born\nrule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a\nquantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure\nstate to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently\nderived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI\n- precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative\ndescription of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden\nmeasurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of\nthe values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of\nprobabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide\nthe missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However,\nEBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific\nnotion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical\nmechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.\n","Comment: 9 pages"]}]

The low frequencies\nhelp determine the kinematically relevant, low-wavenumber components of the\nvelocity model, which are in turn needed to avoid convergence of FWI to\nspurious local minima. However, acquiring data below 2 or 3 Hz from the field\nis a challenging and expensive task. In this paper we explore the possibility\nof synthesizing the low frequencies computationally from high-frequency data,\nand use the resulting prediction of the missing data to seed the frequency\nsweep of FWI. As a signal processing problem, bandwidth extension is a very\nnonlinear and delicate operation. It requires a high-level interpretation of\nbandlimited seismic records into individual events, each of which is\nextrapolable to a lower (or higher) frequency band from the non-dispersive\nnature of the wave propagation model. We propose to use the phase tracking\nmethod for the event separation task. The fidelity of the resulting\nextrapolation method is typically higher in phase than in amplitude. To\ndemonstrate the reliability of bandwidth extension in the context of FWI, we\nfirst use the low frequencies in the extrapolated band as data substitute, in\norder to create the low-wavenumber background velocity model, and then switch\nto recorded data in the available band for the rest of the iterations. The\nresulting method, EFWI for short, demonstrates surprising robustness to the\ninaccuracies in the extrapolated low frequency data. With two synthetic\nexamples calibrated so that regular FWI needs to be initialized at 1 Hz to\navoid local minima, we demonstrate that FWI based on an extrapolated [1, 5] Hz\nband, itself generated from data available in the [5, 15] Hz band, can produce\nreasonable estimations of the low wavenumber velocity models.\n"]}]

We are\ninterested in the SPI instrument aboard the INTEGRAL mission and have performed\nthorough checks to ensure a correct handling of the data.
