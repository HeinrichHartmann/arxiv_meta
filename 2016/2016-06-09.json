Distributional models give graded similarity ratings for\nwords and phrases, but do not capture sentence structure in the same detail as\nlogic-based approaches. So it has been argued that the two are complementary.\nWe adopt a hybrid approach that combines logic-based and distributional\nsemantics through probabilistic logic inference in Markov Logic Networks\n(MLNs). In this paper, we focus on the three components of a practical system\nintegrating logical and distributional models: 1) Parsing and task\nrepresentation is the logic-based part where input problems are represented in\nprobabilistic logic. This is quite different from representing them in standard\nfirst-order logic. 2) For knowledge base construction we form weighted\ninference rules. We integrate and compare distributional information with other\nsources, notably WordNet and an existing paraphrase collection. In particular,\nwe use our system to evaluate distributional lexical entailment approaches. We\nuse a variant of Robinson resolution to determine the necessary inference\nrules. More sources can easily be added by mapping them to logical rules; our\nsystem learns a resource-specific weight that corrects for scaling differences\nbetween resources. 3) In discussing probabilistic inference, we show how to\nsolve the inference problems efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we use the\ntask of textual entailment (RTE), which can utilize the strengths of both\nlogic-based and distributional representations.

Since the phenotypic variations may only be due to a small fraction\nof the available genetic information, we propose an estimator of the\nheritability that can be used in high dimensional sparse linear mixed models.\nOur method consists of three steps. Firstly, a variable selection stage is\nperformed in order to recover the support of the genetic effects -- also called\ncausal variants -- that is to find the genetic effects which really explain the\nphenotypic variations.

The fast Krylov subspace solvers\nwith suitable circulant preconditioners are designed to deal with the resulting\nToeplitz linear systems. Each time level of these methods reduces the memory\nrequirement of the proposed implicit difference scheme from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$\nto $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ and the computational complexity from $O(N^3)$ to $O(N\\log\nN)$ in each iterative step, where $N$ is the number of grid nodes.

This is the case for voltage-gated\ncalcium channels (VGCCs). They are present in all mammalian central neurons,\ncontrolling presynaptic release of transmitter, postsynaptic signaling and\nsynaptic integration. The amplitudes of their single channel currents in a\nphysiological concentration of extracellular calcium, however, are small and\nnot well determined. However, measurement of this quantity is essential for\nestimating numbers of functional VGCCs in the membrane and the size of\nchannel-associated calcium signaling domains, and for understanding the\nstochastic nature of calcium signaling. Here, we recorded the VGCC current in\nnucleated patches from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rat neocortex, in\nphysiological external calcium (1-2 mM). The ensemble-averaging of current\nresponses required for conventional fluctuation analysis proved impractical\nbecause of the rapid rundown of calcium channel currents. We therefore\ndeveloped a novel, more robust method, using voltage ramp stimulation, mean\ncurrent fitting of individual current responses and band-pass filtering. We\nvalidated the accuracy of the method by analyzing simulated data. At an\nexternal calcium concentration of 1 mM, and a membrane potential of -20 mV, we\nfound that the average single channel current amplitude was about 0.04 pA,\nincreasing to 0.065 pA at 2 mM external calcium, and 0.12 pA at 5 mM. The\nrelaxation time constant of the fluctuations was in the range 0.2-0.8 ms. The\nresults are relevant to understanding the stochastic properties of dendritic\nCa2+ spikes in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. With the reported method,\nsingle channel current amplitude of native VGCCs can be resolved accurately\ndespite conditions of unstable rundown.\n"]}]

For the Q\\bar{Q} scenario, there will be a spin-triplet\npartner \\psi_Q which is slightly heavier that \\eta_Q due to the hyper fine\ninteractions mediated by hypercolor gluon exchange; while for the \\widetilde{Q}\n\\widetilde{Q}^\\dagger scenario, the spin-triplet partner \\chi_{\\widetilde Q}\narises from higher radial excitation with non-zero orbital angular momentum. We\nconsider productions and decays of eta_Q, eta_{\\widetilde Q}, \\psi_Q and\n\\chi_{\\widetilde Q} using the nonrelativistic QCD methods, and identify the\nparameter regions which can explain the observed diphoton excess. We discuss\nhow to test these scenarios using the Drell-Yan process, and the forward dijet\nazimuthal angular distributions to determine the J^{PC} quantum number of the\ndiphoton excess. Another important test of the model is the presence of a\nnearby hypercolor singlet but color-octet state like the ^1S_0 state \\eta^8_Q\nor \\eta^8_{\\widetilde Q}, which may lead to dijet or mono-jet plus mono-photon\nevent.

In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, torus canards are degenerate:\nthey require one-parameter families of 2-fast/1-slow systems in order to be\nobserved and even then, they only occur on exponentially thin parameter\nintervals.

Therefore, the issue of angle-of-attack\nmodulation is formulated as robust output stabilization of the non-minimum\nphase system. A disturbance observer-based feedback linearization technique is\nused to design a robustly dynamical output-feedback controller for\nangle-of-attack modulation, and an internal-state feedback controller for\nbank-angle modulation is used to stabilize the unstable internal dynamics.\nNumerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the performance of the\nproposed method of angle-of-attack modulation is enhanced compared to the\nexisting shuttle method.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 12 figures"]}]

In this paper, we apply neural machine\ntranslation to the task of Arabic translation (Ar<->En) and compare it against\na standard phrase-based translation system. We run extensive comparison using\nvarious configurations in preprocessing Arabic script and show that the\nphrase-based and neural translation systems perform comparably to each other\nand that proper preprocessing of Arabic script has a similar effect on both of\nthe systems. We however observe that the neural machine translation\nsignificantly outperform the phrase-based system on an out-of-domain test set,\nmaking it attractive for real-world deployment.\n","Comment: EMNLP submission"]}]

The $H$-Free Edge\nCompletion problem is defined similarly, but we add edges instead of deleting\nthem.
