Distributional models give graded similarity ratings for\nwords and phrases, but do not capture sentence structure in the same detail as\nlogic-based approaches. So it has been argued that the two are complementary.\nWe adopt a hybrid approach that combines logic-based and distributional\nsemantics through probabilistic logic inference in Markov Logic Networks\n(MLNs). In this paper, we focus on the three components of a practical system\nintegrating logical and distributional models: 1) Parsing and task\nrepresentation is the logic-based part where input problems are represented in\nprobabilistic logic. This is quite different from representing them in standard\nfirst-order logic. 2) For knowledge base construction we form weighted\ninference rules. We integrate and compare distributional information with other\nsources, notably WordNet and an existing paraphrase collection. In particular,\nwe use our system to evaluate distributional lexical entailment approaches. We\nuse a variant of Robinson resolution to determine the necessary inference\nrules. More sources can easily be added by mapping them to logical rules; our\nsystem learns a resource-specific weight that corrects for scaling differences\nbetween resources. 3) In discussing probabilistic inference, we show how to\nsolve the inference problems efficiently.

Since the phenotypic variations may only be due to a small fraction\nof the available genetic information, we propose an estimator of the\nheritability that can be used in high dimensional sparse linear mixed models.\nOur method consists of three steps. Firstly, a variable selection stage is\nperformed in order to recover the support of the genetic effects -- also called\ncausal variants -- that is to find the genetic effects which really explain the\nphenotypic variations. Secondly, we propose a maximum likelihood strategy for\nestimating the heritability which only takes into account the causal genetic\neffects found in the first step. Thirdly, we compute the standard error and the\n95% confidence interval associated to our heritability estimator thanks to a\nnonparametric bootsrap approach. Our main contribution consists in providing an\nestimation of the heritability with standard errors substantially smaller than\nmethods without variable selection when the genetic effects are very sparse.\nSince the real genetic architecture is in general unknown in practice, we also\npropose an empirical criterion which allows the user to decide whether it is\nrelevant to apply a variable selection based approach or not.

The corresponding $Z'$ gauge boson is leptophobic with a mass of\naround 2 TeV and has interactions with $SU(2)_L$ Yang-Mills fields and gauge\nfields of the hypercharge.

Here we co-add South Pole Telescope SZ (SPT-SZ) survey\ndata around a large set of massive quiescent elliptical galaxies at z >= 0.5.\nWe use data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey and VISTA Hemisphere Survey to\ncreate a large catalog of galaxies split up into two redshift bins, with 3394\ngalaxies at 0.5 <= z <= 1.0 and 924 galaxies at 1.0 <= z <= 1.5, with typical\nstellar masses of 1.5 x 10^11 M_Sun.

Based on\nour proposed method to estimate the amount of contribution of individual tokens\nin the input to the final prediction of the networks we show that the image\nprediction pathway: a) is sensitive to the information structure of the\nsentence b) pays selective attention to lexical categories and grammatical\nfunctions that carry semantic information c) learns to treat the same input\ntoken differently depending on its grammatical functions in the sentence. In\ncontrast the language model is comparatively more sensitive to words with a\nsyntactic function.

This is the case for voltage-gated\ncalcium channels (VGCCs). They are present in all mammalian central neurons,\ncontrolling presynaptic release of transmitter, postsynaptic signaling and\nsynaptic integration. The amplitudes of their single channel currents in a\nphysiological concentration of extracellular calcium, however, are small and\nnot well determined. However, measurement of this quantity is essential for\nestimating numbers of functional VGCCs in the membrane and the size of\nchannel-associated calcium signaling domains, and for understanding the\nstochastic nature of calcium signaling. Here, we recorded the VGCC current in\nnucleated patches from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in rat neocortex, in\nphysiological external calcium (1-2 mM). The ensemble-averaging of current\nresponses required for conventional fluctuation analysis proved impractical\nbecause of the rapid rundown of calcium channel currents. We therefore\ndeveloped a novel, more robust method, using voltage ramp stimulation, mean\ncurrent fitting of individual current responses and band-pass filtering. We\nvalidated the accuracy of the method by analyzing simulated data. At an\nexternal calcium concentration of 1 mM, and a membrane potential of -20 mV, we\nfound that the average single channel current amplitude was about 0.04 pA,\nincreasing to 0.065 pA at 2 mM external calcium, and 0.12 pA at 5 mM. The\nrelaxation time constant of the fluctuations was in the range 0.2-0.8 ms. The\nresults are relevant to understanding the stochastic properties of dendritic\nCa2+ spikes in neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons. With the reported method,\nsingle channel current amplitude of native VGCCs can be resolved accurately\ndespite conditions of unstable rundown.\n"]}]

In this letter, we consider a\npossibility that the excess is due to a composite (pseudo)scalar boson, whose\nconstituents are either new vector-like quarks (Q\\bar{Q}) or scalar quarks\n(\\widetilde{Q} \\widetilde{Q}^\\dagger) which feel new QCD-like (hypercolor QCD)\nconfining force with confinement scale \\Lambda_h. Assuming m_Q (m_{\\widetilde\nQ}) >> Lambda_h, the observed 750 GeV excess could be either Q\\bar{Q} (^1S_0)\nstate with J^{PC} = 0^{-+} or \\widetilde{Q} \\widetilde{Q}^\\dagger (^1S_0) state\nwith J^{PC}=0^{++}. For the Q\\bar{Q} scenario, there will be a spin-triplet\npartner \\psi_Q which is slightly heavier that \\eta_Q due to the hyper fine\ninteractions mediated by hypercolor gluon exchange; while for the \\widetilde{Q}\n\\widetilde{Q}^\\dagger scenario, the spin-triplet partner \\chi_{\\widetilde Q}\narises from higher radial excitation with non-zero orbital angular momentum. We\nconsider productions and decays of eta_Q, eta_{\\widetilde Q}, \\psi_Q and\n\\chi_{\\widetilde Q} using the nonrelativistic QCD methods, and identify the\nparameter regions which can explain the observed diphoton excess. We discuss\nhow to test these scenarios using the Drell-Yan process, and the forward dijet\nazimuthal angular distributions to determine the J^{PC} quantum number of the\ndiphoton excess. Another important test of the model is the presence of a\nnearby hypercolor singlet but color-octet state like the ^1S_0 state \\eta^8_Q\nor \\eta^8_{\\widetilde Q}, which may lead to dijet or mono-jet plus mono-photon\nevent. Both possibilities of large or small width of the resonance can be\naccommodated depending on whether the hyper glueball states are kinematically\nallowed in the final state or not.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, figures and discussion on the color-octet bound\n  states are updated"]}]

A\nrelatively new dynamic phenomenon, torus canards have been found in neural\napplications to mediate the transition from spiking to bursting via\namplitude-modulated spiking. In $\\mathbb{R}^3$, torus canards are degenerate:\nthey require one-parameter families of 2-fast/1-slow systems in order to be\nobserved and even then, they only occur on exponentially thin parameter\nintervals.

In\nthis paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade\nOpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an\noriginal montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of\nelectrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a\nsimple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the\nelectrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any\npossible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding\n\"ideal\" diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested\n-- the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300\nspeller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board -- or a\nsimilar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip -- could be an\neffective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade\nequipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG\nreadings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be\nsuitable for popularizing BCI uses.\n","Comment: PhyCS - International Conference on Physiological Computing Systems,\n  Jul 2016, Lisbon, Portugal.
