Prior to this work, the best known upper bounds for both parameters were\n$\\log(m)$, while the best lower bounds are linear in $d$. We present\nsignificantly better upper bounds on both as follows.

As a corollary, we describe a\ngeneral procedure with which we can modify a continuous-time branching random\nwalk which has a weak phase and turn it into a continuous-time branching random\nwalk which has strong local survival for large or small values of the parameter\nand non-strong local survival for intermediate values of the parameter.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures, a few minor misprints have been fixed"]}]

The typical method used for such computations is the Hutchinson method\nwhich is a Monte Carlo (MC) averaging over matrix quadratures. To improve its\nconvergence, several variance reductions techniques have been proposed. In this\npaper, we study the effects of deflating the near null singular value space. We\nmake two main contributions.\n  First, we analyze the variance of the Hutchinson method as a function of the\ndeflated singular values and vectors. Although this provides good intuition in\ngeneral, by assuming additionally that the singular vectors are random unitary\nmatrices, we arrive at concise formulas for the deflated variance that include\nonly the variance and mean of the singular values. We make the remarkable\nobservation that deflation may increase variance for Hermitian matrices but not\nfor non-Hermitian ones. This is a rare, if not unique, property where\nnon-Hermitian matrices outperform Hermitian ones. The theory can be used as a\nmodel for predicting the benefits of deflation.\n  Second, we use deflation in the context of a large scale application of\n\"disconnected diagrams\" in Lattice QCD. On lattices, Hierarchical Probing (HP)\nhas previously provided an order of magnitude of variance reduction over MC by\nremoving \"error\" from neighboring nodes of increasing distance in the lattice.\nAlthough deflation used directly on MC yields a limited improvement of 30% in\nour problem, when combined with HP they reduce variance by a factor of over 60\ncompared to MC. For this, we pre-computated 1000 smallest singular values of an\nill-conditioned matrix of size 25 million.

Such uncertainties are\ntypically addressed by using multiple, accurately chosen training signals to\nrecover the missing information on the sensing model, an approach that can be\nresource-consuming and cumbersome. Conversely, blind calibration does not\nemploy any training signal, but corresponds to a bilinear inverse problem whose\nalgorithmic solution is an open issue. We here address blind calibration as a\nnon-convex problem for linear random sensing models, in which we aim to recover\nan unknown signal from its projections on sub-Gaussian random vectors, each\nsubject to an unknown multiplicative factor (or gain). To solve this\noptimisation problem we resort to projected gradient descent starting from a\nsuitable, carefully chosen initialisation point. An analysis of this algorithm\nallows us to show that it converges to the exact solution provided a sample\ncomplexity requirement is met, i.e., relating convergence to the amount of\ninformation collected during the sensing process. Interestingly, we show that\nthis requirement grows linearly (up to log factors) in the number of unknowns\nof the problem. This sample complexity is found both in absence of prior\ninformation, as well as when subspace priors are available for both the signal\nand gains, allowing a further reduction of the number of observations required\nfor our recovery guarantees to hold. Moreover, in the presence of noise we show\nhow our descent algorithm yields a solution whose accuracy degrades gracefully\nwith the amount of noise affecting the measurements. Finally, we present some\nnumerical experiments in an imaging context, where our algorithm allows for a\nsimple solution to blind calibration of the gains in a sensor array.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 7 figures.

Contrary to current slice-to-volume registration (SVR)\nmethods, requiring an inflexible anatomical enclosure of a single investigated\norgan, the proposed patch-to-volume reconstruction (PVR) approach is able to\nreconstruct a large field of view of non-rigidly deforming structures. It\nrelaxes rigid motion assumptions by introducing a specific amount of redundant\ninformation that is exploited with parallelized patch-wise optimization,\nsuper-resolution, and automatic outlier rejection. We further describe and\nprovide an efficient parallel implementation of PVR allowing its execution\nwithin reasonable time on commercially available graphics processing units\n(GPU), enabling its use in the clinical practice. We evaluate PVR's\ncomputational overhead compared to standard methods and observe improved\nreconstruction accuracy in presence of affine motion artifacts of approximately\n30% compared to conventional SVR in synthetic experiments. Furthermore, we have\nevaluated our method qualitatively and quantitatively on real fetal MRI data\nsubject to maternal breathing and sudden fetal movements. We evaluate\npeak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and\ncross correlation (CC) with respect to the originally acquired data and provide\na method for visual inspection of reconstruction uncertainty. With these\nexperiments we demonstrate successful application of PVR motion compensation to\nthe whole uterus, the human fetus, and the human placenta.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 13 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical\n  Imaging. v2: wadded funders acknowledgements to preprint"]}]

To better\ndifferentiate the top performers, additional criteria are required. Moreover,\nthe (test) images, on which the performance scores are based, predominantly\ncontain fully visible objects. Therefore, `harder' test images, mimicking the\nchallenging conditions (e.g. occlusion) in which humans routinely recognize\nobjects, need to be utilized for benchmarking. To address the concerns\nmentioned above, we make two contributions. First, we systematically vary the\nlevel of local object-part content, global detail and spatial context in images\nfrom PASCAL VOC 2010 to create a new benchmarking dataset dubbed PPSS-12.\nSecond, we propose an object-part based benchmarking procedure which quantifies\nclassifiers' robustness to a range of visibility and contextual settings. The\nbenchmarking procedure relies on a semantic similarity measure that naturally\naddresses potential semantic granularity differences between the category\nlabels in training and test datasets, thus eliminating manual mapping. We use\nour procedure on the PPSS-12 dataset to benchmark top-performing classifiers\ntrained on the ILSVRC-2012 dataset. Our results show that the proposed\nbenchmarking procedure enables additional differentiation among\nstate-of-the-art object classifiers in terms of their ability to handle missing\ncontent and insufficient object detail. Given this capability for additional\ndifferentiation, our approach can potentially supplement existing benchmarking\nprocedures used in object recognition challenge leaderboards.\n","Comment: Extended version of our ACCV-2016 paper.

In the present\nwork we resume Sakharov's original program for baryogenesis and propose a\ncentral role for gravity in the process. This is achieved through a non-minimal\ncoupling (NMC) between the gravitational field and both the strong interaction\nfield and the quark fields. When in action, the present mechanism leads to\nbaryon number non-conservation and CP violation. Moreover, the NMC induces\nreduced effective quark masses, which favours a first order QCD phase\ntransition. As a consequence, a baryon asymmetry can be attained in the\ntransition from the quark epoch to the hadron epoch.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures, replacement with correct figures and captions"]}]

To conformally coat many\ngrams of nanoparticles with ALD, long precursor soaking steps, fluidized beds,\nvibrating stages, or rotary feedthroughs are typically needed. While these\nimpressive advancements in ALD techniques dominate literature searches of\nparticle ALD coating, such methods may lead to a more time-intensive or\ncost-prohibitive process than what is required by many typical academic\nresearchers. Thus we have performed this study to explore the limits of static\nplanar ALD particle coating, the simplest method to coat nanoparticles with an\nALD film. Using an Arradiance GEMStar6 ALD system, we have explored a fast and\nsimple static ALD particle coating process. Our protocol produces relatively\nsmall, but still academically useful, quantities of uniformally ALD-coated\nnanospheres. This process can be scaled up to nanoparticle samples in the tens\nof milligram to gram range. We have demonstrated that we can achieve silica or\ntitania spherical particle synthesis, and then uniform ALD coating on the\nnanoparticles, all within 8-10 hours. The diameter of the chemically\nsynthesized silica and titania nanoparticles is tunable from 50 nm up to\ngreater than a micron. The refractive index of the titania nanoparticles is\ntunable from approximately 1.7 to 2.7. This report will be most useful for\nresearchers who are new to particle ALD, or who want to experiment with core\nparticles conformally covered with ALD shells before moving to a more\ncomplicated, higher throughput ALD method. We provide details for particle\nsynthesis, storage, and ALD coating along with a comparison to more\nconventional approaches.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The resulting\nsuppression of noise enables fast, high- fidelity readout of naturally weakly\ncoupled qubits, and the possibility to protect strongly coupled qubits from\ndecoherence by weakening their coupling. Unlike other approaches exploiting\nsqueezing, our setup avoids the difficult task of transporting and injecting\nwith high fidelity an externally-generated squeezed state. Our setup is also\nsurprisingly robust against unwanted non-QND backaction effects, as\ninterference naturally suppresses Purcell decay: the system acts as its own\nPurcell filter. Our setup is compatible with the experimental state-of-the-art\nin circuit QED systems, but the basic idea could also be realized in other\nsystems.\n","Comment: 5 pages main text, 4 figures, 7 pages supplementary appendices"]}]

Objective: Our aim is\nto clarify the relationship between code clones and faults. In particular, we\nfocus on inconsistent (or type-3) clones in this work. Method: We conducted a\ncase study with TWT GmbH where we detected the code clones in three Java\nsystems, set them into relation to information from issue tracking and version\ncontrol and interviewed three key developers. Results: Of the type-3 clones, 17\n% contain faults. Developers modified most of the type-3 clones simultaneously\nand thereby fixed half of the faults in type-3 clones consistently. Type-2\nclones with faults all evolved to fixed type-3 clones. Clone length is only\nweakly correlated with faultiness. Conclusion: There are indications that the\ndevelopers in two cases have been aware of clones. It might be a reason for the\nweak relationship between type-3 clones and faults. Hence, it seems important\nto keep developers aware of clones, potentially with new tool support. Future\nstudies need to investigate if the rate of faults in type-3 clones justifies\nusing them as cues in defect detection.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 0 figures"]}]

The ISO's problem is a multi-stage stochastic optimization\nproblem to dispatch energy from each generator to minimize the cost of\npurchased energy on behalf of the consumers.

These technologies have been applied to a\nvariety of domains, including neuroprosthetic control and the monitoring of\nepileptic seizures. Existing BCI systems primarily use a priori knowledge of\nEEG features of interest to build machine learning models. Recently,\nconvolutional networks have been used for automatic feature extraction of large\nimage databases, where they have obtained state-of-the-art results. In this\nwork we introduce EEGNet, a compact fully convolutional network for EEG-based\nBCIs developed using Deep Learning approaches. Methods: EEGNet is a 4-layer\nconvolutional network that uses filter factorization for learning a compact\nrepresentation of EEG time series. EEGNet is one of the smallest convolutional\nnetworks to date, having less than 2200 parameters for a binary classification.\nResults: We show state-of-the-art classification performance across four\ndifferent BCI paradigms: P300 event-related potential, error-related\nnegativity, movement-related cortical potential, and sensory motor rhythm, with\nas few as 500 EEG trials.

This is not caused by a built-in\ninstinct, but because a rational agent will maximize expected utility and\ncannot achieve whatever objective it has been given if it is dead.

A traditional agent takes its\nreward function for granted: we show that such agents have an incentive to\ndisable the off switch, except in the special case where H is perfectly\nrational. Our key insight is that for R to want to preserve its off switch, it\nneeds to be uncertain about the utility associated with the outcome, and to\ntreat H's actions as important observations about that utility.

Covert aspects of ongoing user mental states provide key context\ninformation for user-aware human computer interactions.

To improve the feasibility and wearability of vigilance estimation\ndevices for real-world applications, we adopt a novel electrode placement for\nforehead EOG and extract various eye movement features, which contain the\nprincipal information of traditional EOG. We explore the effects of EEG from\ndifferent brain areas and combine EEG and forehead EOG to leverage their\ncomplementary characteristics for vigilance estimation. Considering that the\nvigilance of users is a dynamic changing process because the intrinsic mental\nstates of users involve temporal evolution, we introduce continuous conditional\nneural field and continuous conditional random field models to capture dynamic\ntemporal dependency. Main results. We propose a multimodal approach to\nestimating vigilance by combining EEG and forehead EOG and incorporating the\ntemporal dependency of vigilance into model training. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that modality fusion can improve the performance compared with a\nsingle modality, EOG and EEG contain complementary information for vigilance\nestimation, and the temporal dependency-based models can enhance the\nperformance of vigilance estimation. From the experimental results, we observe\nthat theta and alpha frequency activities are increased, while gamma frequency\nactivities are decreased in drowsy states in contrast to awake states.\nSignificance.
