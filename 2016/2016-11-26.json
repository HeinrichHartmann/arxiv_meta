A neural model, whose structure is mainly based on\nsome physical equations describing the engine behaviour, is built for the\nrotation speed and the exhaust gas opacity.

The magnetic field is\nquasi-isotropic and has field strengths weaker than 100G. It is pervasive and\nmay host a local dynamo. Aims: We aim to determine the length scale of the\nturbulent magnetic field in the quiet Sun. Methods: The Stokes V area asymmetry\nis sensitive to minute variations in the magnetic topology along the line of\nsight.

For the last, we confirm\nits isotropy and measure correlation lengths from hundreds of kilometers down\nto 10km, at which point we lost sensitivity.

A key reason is that the presence of a fixed\nminimum length would seem to contradict the ability of Lorentz transformations\nto contract lengths. In this paper, we implement a fully covariant Planck scale\ncutoff by cutting off the spectrum of the d'Alembertian. In this scenario,\nconsistent with Lorentz contractions, wavelengths that are arbitrarily smaller\nthan the Planck length continue to exist. However, the dynamics of modes of\nwavelengths that are significantly smaller than the Planck length possess a\nvery small bandwidth. This has the effect of freezing the dynamics of such\nmodes. While both, wavelengths and bandwidths, are frame dependent, Lorentz\ncontraction and time dilation conspire to make the freezing of modes of\ntransplanckian wavelengths covariant. In particular, we show that this\nultraviolet cutoff can be implemented covariantly also in curved spacetimes. We\nfocus on Friedmann Robertson Walker (FRW) spacetimes and their much-discussed\ntransplanckian question: The physical wavelength of each comoving mode was\nsmaller than the Planck scale at sufficiently early times. What was the mode's\ndynamics then? Here, we show that in the presence of the covariant UV cutoff,\nthe dynamical bandwidth of a comoving mode is essentially zero up until its\nphysical wavelength starts exceeding the Planck length. In particular, we show\nthat under general assumptions, the number of dynamical degrees of freedom of\neach comoving mode all the way up to some arbitrary finite time is actually\nfinite.

The main aim of the present paper is to give a\nfull list and detailed proofs of algebraic properties of qMMs known up to the\nmoment and, in particular, to show that most of the basic theorems of linear\nalgebras (e.g., Jacobi ratio theorems, Schhur complement, the Cayley-Hamilton\ntheorem and so on and so forth) have a straightforward counterpart for q-Manin\nmatrices. We also show how this classs of matrices ?ts within the theory of\nquasi-determninants of Gel'fand-Retakh and collaborators (see, e.g., [17]). In\nthe last sections of the paper, we frame our definitions within the tensorial\napproach to non-commutative matrices of the Leningrad school, and we show how\nthe notion of q-Manin matrix is related to theory of Quantum Integrable\nSystems.\n","Comment: 62 pages, v.2 cosmetic changes, typos fixed"]}]

(2a) So now, relative to what I\nknow, it is not rational of me to believe S. These seem a perfectly ordinary,\ncommon sense, pair of situations. Generally and vaguely, I take them to embody\nwhat I shall call probabilistic inference. This form of inference is clearly\nnon-monotonic. Relatively few people have taken this form of inference, based\non high probability, to serve as a foundation for non-monotonic logic or for a\nlogical or defeasible inference. There are exceptions: Jane Nutter [16] thinks\nthat sometimes probability has something to do with non-monotonic reasoning.\nJudea Pearl [ 17] has recently been exploring the possibility. There are any\nnumber of people whom one might call probability enthusiasts who feel that\nprobability provides all the answers by itself, with no need of help from\nlogic. Cheeseman [1], Henrion [5] and others think it useful to look at a\ndistribution of probabilities over a whole algebra of statements, to update\nthat distribution in the light of new evidence, and to use the latest updated\ndistribution of probability over the algebra as a basis for planning and\ndecision making. A slightly weaker form of this approach is captured by Nilsson\n[15], where one assumes certain probabilities for certain statements, and\ninfers the probabilities, or constraints on the probabilities of other\nstatement. None of this corresponds to what I call probabilistic inference. All\nof the inference that is taking place, either in Bayesian updating, or in\nprobabilistic logic, is strictly deductive. Deductive inference, particularly\nthat concerned with the distribution of classical probabilities or chances, is\nof great importance. But this is not to say that there is no important role for\nwhat earlier logicians have called \"ampliative\" or \"inductive\" or \"scientific\"\ninference, in which the conclusion goes beyond the premises, asserts more than\ndo the premises. This depends on what David Israel [6] has called \"real rules\nof inference\".

The review focuses on\nthe basic paradigms and departure points without presenting advanced\ntheoretical or observational details for which there exists a large number of\ncomprehensive reviews. Instead, emphasis is placed on numerical modeling which\nhas played an increasingly significant role as computational resources have\nbecome more abundant. A main theme is the progress that has been made over the\nyears. The emphasis is on the global features of CR modulation and on the\ncauses of the observed 11-year and 22-year cycles and charge-sign dependent\nmodulation. Illustrative examples of some of the theoretical and observational\nmilestones are presented, without attempting to review all details or every\ncontribution made in this field of research. Controversial aspects are\ndiscussed where appro- priate, with accompanying challenges and future\nprospects. The year 2012 was the centennial celebration of the discovery of\ncosmic rays so that several general reviews were dedicated to historical\naspects so that such developments are brie y presented only in a few cases.\n","Comment: Published version available at\n  http://www.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2013-3"]}]

In this\npaper, we present a multiscale finite element method for wave propagation on a\ncoarse grid. The proposed method is based on the Generalized Multiscale Finite\nElement Method (GMsFEM). To construct multiscale basis functions, we start with\ntwo snapshot spaces in each coarse-grid block where one represents the degrees\nof freedom on the boundary and the other represents the degrees of freedom in\nthe interior. We use local spectral problems to identify important modes in\neach snapshot space. These local spectral problems are different from each\nother and their formulations are based on the analysis. To our best knowledge,\nthis is the first time where multiple snapshot spaces and multiple spectral\nproblems are used and necessary for efficient computations. Using the dominant\nmodes from local spectral problems, multiscale basis functions are constructed\nto represent the solution space locally within each coarse block. These\nmultiscale basis functions are coupled via the symmetric interior penalty\ndiscontinuous Galerkin method which provides a block diagonal mass matrix, and,\nconsequently, results in fast computations in an explicit time discretiza-\ntion.

The plug-in\nalgorithms are based on replacing the unknown density by some nonparametric\nestimator, usually the kernel. Thus, the bandwidth selection is a fundamental\nproblem from an applied perspective. However, if some a priori information\nabout the geometry of the level set is available, then excess mass algorithms\ncould be useful. Hybrid methods such that granulometric smoothing algorithm\nassume a mild geometric restriction on the level set and it requires a pilot\nnonparametric estimator of the density. In this work, a new hybrid algorithm is\nproposed under the assumption that the level set is r-convex. The main problem\nin practice is that r is an unknown geometric characteristic of the set. A\nstochastic algorithm is proposed for selecting its optimal value. The resulting\ndata-driven reconstruction of the level set is able to achieve the same\nconvergence rates as the granulometric smoothing method. However, they do no\ndepend on any penalty term because, although the value of the shape index r is\na priori unknown, it is estimated in a data-driven way from the sample points.\nThe practical performance of the estimator proposed is illustrated through a\nreal data example.\n","Comment: 49 pages"]}]
