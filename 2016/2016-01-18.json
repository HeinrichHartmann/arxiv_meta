A continuous map of an interval to the real line\nwhich sends the endpoints in opposite directions has a fixed point. We\ngeneralize this to maps on non-invariant continua in the plane under positively\noriented maps of the plane (with appropriate boundary conditions). These\nmethods imply that in some cases non-invariant continua in the plane are\ndegenerate. This has important applications in complex dynamics. E.g., a\nspecial case of our results shows that if $X$ is a non-separating invariant\nsubcontinuum of the Julia set of a polynomial $P$ containing no fixed Cremer\npoints and exhibiting no local rotation at all fixed points, then $X$ must be a\npoint.

The intermediate node connects the source and the destination nodes via a\nset of noiseless parallel channels, with sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively. A\nmessage $M$ is to be sent from S to D. The information in the network may be\neavesdropped by a set of wiretappers. The wiretappers cannot communicate with\none another. Each wiretapper can access a subset of channels, called a wiretap\nset. All the chosen wiretap sets form a wiretap pattern. A random key $K$ is\ngenerated at S and a coding scheme on $(M, K)$ is employed to protect $M$. We\ndefine two decoding classes at D: In Class-I, only $M$ is required to be\nrecovered and in Class-II, both $M$ and $K$ are required to be recovered. The\nobjective is to minimize $H(K)/H(M)$ {for a given wiretap pattern} under the\nperfect secrecy constraint. The first question we address is whether routing is\noptimal on this simple network. By enumerating all the wiretap patterns on the\nClass-I/II $(3,3)$ networks and harnessing the power of Shannon-type\ninequalities, we find that gaps exist between the bounds implied by routing and\nthe bounds implied by Shannon-type inequalities for a small fraction~($<2\\%$)\nof all the wiretap patterns.

We study some simple wiretap patterns and find that their Shannon\nbounds (i.e., the lower bound induced by Shannon-type inequalities) can be\nachieved by linear codes, which means routing is not sufficient even for the\n($3$, $3$) network.

Existing solutions for the problem mostly adopt a\nhierarchical decomposition approach, which recursively splits Omega into\nsub-domains and computes a noisy tuple count for each sub-domain, until all\nnoisy counts are below a certain threshold. This approach, however, requires\nthat we (i) impose a limit h on the recursion depth in the splitting of Omega\nand (ii) set the noise in each count to be proportional to h. This leads to\ninferior data utility due to the following dilemma: if we use a small h, then\nthe resulting histogram would be too coarse-grained to provide an accurate\napproximation of data distribution; meanwhile, a large h would yield a\nfine-grained histogram, but its quality would be severely degraded by the\nincreased amount of noise in the tuple counts.\n  To remedy the deficiency of existing solutions, we present PrivTree, a\nhistogram construction algorithm that also applies hierarchical decomposition\nbut features a crucial (and somewhat surprising) improvement: when deciding\nwhether or not to split a sub-domain, the amount of noise required in the\ncorresponding tuple count is independent of the recursive depth.

Realizing the benefits from this evolution is made more difficult\nbecause a typical industrial plant includes multiple vendors and legacy\ntechnology stacks. Aggregating all the raw data to a single data center before\nperforming analysis increases response times, raising performance concerns in\ntraditional markets and requiring a compromise between data duplication and\ndata access performance. Similar to the way microservices can integrate\ndisparate information technologies without imposing monolithic cross-cutting\narchitecture impacts, we propose microdatabases to manage the data\nheterogeneity of the Industrial Internet while allowing records to be captured\nand secured close to the industrial processes, but also be made available near\nthe applications that can benefit from the data. A microdatabase is an\nabstraction of a data store that standardizes and protects the interactions\nbetween distributed data sources, providers and consumers. It integrates an\ninformation model with discoverable object types that can be browsed\ninteractively and programmatically, and supports repository instances that\nevolve with their own lifecycles. The microdatabase abstraction is independent\nof technology choice and was designed based on solicitation and review of\nindustry stakeholder concerns.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, pending submission"]}]

Expert\ncrowdsourcing involves macrotasks, like document writing, product design, or\nweb development, which take more time than typical binary microtasks, require\nexpert skills, assume varying degrees of knowledge over a topic, and require\ncrowd workers to build on each other's contributions. Current works usually\nassume offline optimization models, which consider worker and task arrivals\nknown and do not take into account the element of time. Realistically however,\ntime is critical: tasks have deadlines, expert workers are available only at\nspecific time slots, and worker/task arrivals are not known a-priori. Our work\nis the first to address the problem of optimal task sequencing for online,\nheterogeneous, time-constrained macrotasks. We propose tas-online, an online\nalgorithm that aims to complete as many tasks as possible within budget,\nrequired quality and a given timeline, without future input information\nregarding job release dates or worker availabilities. Results, comparing\ntas-online to four typical benchmarks, show that it achieves more completed\njobs, lower flow times and higher job quality.

We find that surface aging in ambient\nconditions occurs in two major steps. Within two hours of exfoliation, a series\nof ~ 3.6 A high islands are observed by atomic force microscopy over\napproximate 10% of the surface. Subsequently, patch growth stops, and oxidation\nbegins after the two hours and continues until one quintuple layer has been\noxidized. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows no sign of oxidation before ~\n120 minutes of exposure to air, and the oxygen 1s peak is clearly present after\n~ 190 minutes of ambient exposure. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry\nalso indicates that the oxidation of a full quintuple layer occurs on the time\nscale of days. These results are in good agreement with the time dependent\nchanges previously observed in the surface crystal structure by second harmonic\ngeneration. In addition to providing the ability to non-destructively measure\noxide on the surface of Bi2Se3 crystals, ellipsometry can be used to identify\nthe thickness of Bi2Se3 flakes.
