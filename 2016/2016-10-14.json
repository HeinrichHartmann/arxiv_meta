Upon\noxidation of nearly all the SWCNT's vacancies, the central peak's intensity for\nthe metallic SWCNT sample is 60\\% greater than for the semiconducting SWCNT\nsample.

Since the stellar rate for this reaction cannot be determined\nby a measurement directly, the aim of the present work was to measure the cross\nsection of the inverse 124Xe(a,g)128Ba reaction and to compare the results with\nstatistical model predictions. Of great importance is the fact that data below\nthe (a,n) threshold was obtained. Studying simultaneously the 124Xe(a,n)127Ba\nreaction channel at higher energy allowed to further identify the source of a\ndiscrepancy between data and prediction. The 124Xe + alpha cross sections were\nmeasured with the activation method using a thin window 124Xe gas cell. The\nstudied energy range was between E = 11 and 15 MeV close above the\nastrophysically relevant energy range. The obtained cross sections are compared\nwith statistical model calculations. The experimental cross sections are\nsmaller than standard predictions previously used in astrophysical\ncalculations.

The experimental data suggest an alpha width lower by at\nleast a factor of 0.125 in the astrophysical energy range. An upper limit for\nthe 128Ba(g,a)124Xe stellar rate was inferred from our measurement. The impact\nof this rate was studied in two different models for core-collapse supernova\nexplosions of 25 solar mass stars. A significant contribution to the 124Xe\nabundance via this reaction path would only be possible when the rate was\nincreased above the previous standard value.

Despite the importance of observations of M104, a consensus\ndistance has not yet been established. Here, we use newly obtained Hubble Space\nTelescope optical imaging to measure the distance to M104 based on the tip of\nthe red giant branch method. Our measurement yields the distance to M104 to be\n9.55 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.31 Mpc equivalent to a distance modulus of 29.90 +/- 0.03\n+/- 0.07 mag. Our distance is an improvement over previous results as we use a\nwell-calibrated, stable distance indicator, precision photometry in a optimally\nselected field of view, and a Bayesian Maximum Likelihood technique that\nreduces measurement uncertainties. The most discrepant previous results are due\nto Tully-Fisher method distances, which are likely inappropriate for M104 given\nits peculiar morphology and structure. Our results are part of a larger program\nto measure accurate distances to a sample of well-known spiral galaxies\n(including M51, M74, and M63) using the tip of the red giant branch method.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

The cascade condition provides an easily computed\nmeasure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology.\nUsing the percolation theory for random networks we also derive an analytic\nformula for the frequency of global cascades.

Using this\ncondition, we first prove that every $K_4$-minor free graph of odd-girth $2k+1$\nadmits a homomorphism to the projective hypercube of dimension $2k$.

Recent studies show a scaling of the\ndivertor broadening with an inverse power law to the target temperature $T_t$,\npromising its reduction to be a way of distributing the power entering the\ndivertor volume onto a large surface area.\n  It is shown that for pure conductive transport in the divertor region the\nsuggested inverse power law scaling to $T_t$ is only valid for high target\nelectron temperatures. For decreasing target temperatures ($T_t < 20\\,$eV) the\nincrease of $S$ stagnates and the conductive model results in a finite value of\n$S$ even for zero target temperature.

This is shown in simulations\nsolving the 2D heat diffusion equation, which is used as reference for an\nanalytic 1D model describing the divertor broadening along a field line solely\nby the ratio of the perpendicular to the parallel diffusivity.\n  By assuming the temperature dependence of these two quantities an integral\nform of $S$ is derived, relying only on the temperature distribution along the\nseparatrix between X-point and target. Integration along the separatrix results\nin an approximation for $S$, being in agreement with the 2D simulations.

The susceptibility can be measured by\nevolving the slave equation in conjunction with the original Langevin process.\nThis procedure yields a direct estimate of the susceptibility and avoids the\nneed, when performing numerical simulations, to include applied external fields\nexplicitly. The success of the method however depends on the statistical\nproperties of the slave estimator. The joint probability density function for\nx_t and xi_t is analyzed. In the case where the potential of the system has a\nconcave component the probability density function of the slave acquires a\npower law tail characterized by a temperature dependent exponent. Thus we show\nthat while the average value of the slave, in the equilibrium state, is always\nfinite and given by the fluctuation dissipation relation, higher moments and\nindeed the variance may show divergences. The behavior of the power law\nexponent is analyzed in a general context and it is calculated explicitly in\nsome specific examples. Our results are confirmed by numerical simulations and\nwe discuss possible measurement discrepancies in the fluctuation dissipation\nrelation which could arise due to this behavior.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 2 .eps figures, Phys.
