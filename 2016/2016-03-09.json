A general concept of\nlogistics network is suggested and motivated for modeling a service of any kind\nsupplied through links between the nodes of the network. The efficiency of a\nsingle link is defined to be the ratio of the volume of useful service at the\noutput node to the volume of expended service at the input node of the link\n(for a specific period of time). Similarly, the efficiency of a chain is the\nratio of the volume of service at the output to the volume of service at the\ninput of the chain. The overall efficiency of the chain is calculated as the\nproduct of the efficiencies of its links; the more efficiency of the chain, the\nless are the losses in the chain. This paper introduces the notion of\ninadequacy of service in such a way that the overall inadequacy of a chain is\nequal to the sum of the inadequacies of its links. So the efficiencies are\nbeing multiplied, whereas the inadequacies are being added. Thus, the\nantagonistic pair (efficiency, inadequacy) appears to be analogous to the pair\n(reliability, entropy) in communication theory.

The resulting logic programming\nrepresentation is used to perform various computational tasks. The methodology\nbased on existing action languages works well for small and even medium size\nsystems, but is not meant to deal with larger systems that require structuring\nof knowledge. ALM is meant to remedy this problem. Structuring of knowledge in\nALM is supported by the concepts of module (a formal description of a specific\npiece of knowledge packaged as a unit), module hierarchy, and library, and by\nthe division of a system description of ALM into two parts: theory and\nstructure. A theory consists of one or more modules with a common theme,\npossibly organized into a module hierarchy based on a dependency relation. It\ncontains declarations of sorts, attributes, and properties of the domain\ntogether with axioms describing them. Structures are used to describe the\ndomain's objects. These features, together with the means for defining classes\nof a domain as special cases of previously defined ones, facilitate the\nstepwise development, testing, and readability of a knowledge base, as well as\nthe creation of knowledge representation libraries.

In contrast very few results for\nbipartite systems whose subsystems are of arbitrary dimensions, are known. This\nis because a rich variety of (algebraic or geometric) structure is exhibited by\ndifferent sets of orthogonal states owing to which it is difficult to associate\nsome common property underlying them all, i.e., a common property that would\nplay a crucial role in the local distinguishability of these states.

Steering is relevant for one-sided device-independent key\ndistribution, the realistic implementations of which necessitate the study of\nnoisy scenarios. So far mainly the case of imperfect detection efficiency has\nbeen considered; here we look at the effect of dynamical noise responsible for\ndecoherence and dissipation. In order to set up the optimisation, we map the\nsteering problem into the equivalent joint measurability problem, and employ\nquantum resource-theoretic robustness monotones from that context. The\nadvantage is that incompatibility (hence steerability) with arbitrary pairs of\nnoisy qubit measurements has been completely characterised through an\nanalytical expression, which can be turned into a computable cost function with\nexact gradient. Furthermore, dynamical loss of incompatibility has recently\nbeen illustrated using these monotones.

Most of the systems involved in chains\nof MMRs are periodic configurations. The period ratios of such system, though,\nare not necessarily close to exact commensurability. If a given system resides\nin a divergent migration zone in the disc, the period ratios increase and\nevolve along resonant divergent migration paths at ($P_2/P_1,\nP_3/P_2)$-diagram, where $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are the orbital periods of the first,\nsecond and third planet, respectively. The observed systems, though, do not lie\non those paths. We show that an agreement between the synthetic and the\nobserved systems distributions could be achieved if the orbital circularization\nwas slower than it results from models of the planet-disc interactions.\nTherefore, we conclude that most of those systems unlikely formed as a result\nof divergent migration out of nominal chains of MMRs.\n","Comment: accepted to MNRAS, 10 pages, 9 figures"]}]

For example, the addition of new links\nin a host-parasite system corresponds to the infection of hosts by parasites.\nIncreasing connectivity is beneficial to a parasite and detrimental to a host.\nTherefore, the overall network connectivity is subject to conflicting\npressures. Here, we propose a stochastic network growth model of conflicting\nattachment, inspired by a particular kind of parasite-host interactions: that\nof viruses interacting with microbial hosts. The mechanism of network growth\nincludes conflicting preferences to network density as well as costs involved\nin modifying the network connectivity according to these preferences. We find\nthat the resulting networks exhibit realistic patterns commonly observed in\nempirical data, including the emergence of nestedness, modularity, and\nnested-modular structures that exhibit both properties. We study the role of\nconflicting interests in shaping network structure and assess opportunities to\nincorporate greater realism in linking growth process to pattern in systems\ngoverned by antagonistic and mutualistic interactions.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Quasi-periodic variability has been observed in a number of X-ray\nbinaries harboring black hole candidates. In general relativity, black holes\nare uniquely described by the Kerr metric and, according to the cosmic\ncensorship conjecture, curvature singularities always have to be clothed by an\nevent horizon. Aims. In this paper, we study the effect of an external magnetic\nfield on the observed light curves of orbiting hot spots in thin accretion\ndiscs around Kerr black holes and naked singularities. Methods. We employ a\nray-tracing algorithm to calculate the light curves and power spectra of such\nhot spots as seen by a distant observer for uniform and dipolar magnetic field\nconfigurations assuming a weak coupling between the magnetic field and the disc\nmatter. Results. We show that the presence of an external dipolar magnetic\nfield leads to potentially observable modifications of these signals for both\nKerr black holes and naked singularities, while an external uniform magnetic\nfield has practically no effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the\nemission from a hot spot orbiting near the innermost stable circular orbit of a\nnaked singularity in a dipolar magnetic field can be significantly harder than\nthe emission of the same hot spot in the absence of such a magnetic field.\nConclusions. The comparison of our model with observational data may allow us\nstudy the geometry of magnetic fields around compact objects and to test the\ncosmic censorship conjecture in conjunction with other observables such as\nthermal continuum spectra and iron line profiles.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

We find the\neffects of relativistic broadening to be relatively weak in all cases. In the\ncoronal models, we find the inner radius to be large. In the lamppost model,\nthe inner radius is unconstrained, but when fixed to the innermost stable\norbit, the height of the source is large, which also implies a weak\nrelativistic broadening. In the former models, the inner radius correlates with\nthe X-ray hardness ratio, which is consistent with the presence of a truncated\ndisc turning into a complete disc in the soft state. We also find the degree of\nthe disc ionization to anti-correlate with the hardness, leading to strong\nspectral broadening due to scattering of reflected photons in the reflector in\nthe softest studied states.\n","Comment: MNRAS, in press"]}]

Very recently,\nhint of lepton flavor violation has been observed in the ratio of branching\nfractions of $B \\to K\\,e^+\\,e^-$ to $B \\to K\\,\\mu^+\\,\\mu^-$ decays as well. In\nthis context, we employ an effective Lagrangian approach to study the decay\nbranching fractions and the ratio of branching fractions of $\\Lambda_b \\to\n\\Lambda_c\\,l\\,\\nu$ and $\\Lambda_b \\to p\\,l\\,\\nu$ decays within the standard\nmodel and beyond. We constrain the new physics parameter space using the\nexisting experimental data on $R_D$, $R_{D^{\\ast}}$, and $R_{\\pi}^l$. We give\npredictions for various observables in the context of various new physics\nscenarios.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 4 figures"]}]

The band structures and the\nband state wave functions of these nanowires are calculated and the symmetry\nproperties of the bands and band states are analyzed based on the $C_{3v}$\ndouble point group. It is shown that all bands of these nanowires are doubly\ndegenerate at the $\\Gamma$-point and some of these bands will split into\nnon-degenerate bands when the wave vector $k$ moves away from the\n$\\Gamma$-point as a manifestation of spin-splitting due to spin-orbit\ninteraction. It is also shown that the lower conduction bands of these\nnanowires all show simple parabolic dispersion relations, while the top valence\nbands show complex dispersion relations and band crossings. The band state wave\nfunctions are presented by the spatial probability distributions and it is\nfound that all the band states show $2\\pi/3$-rotation symmetric probability\ndistributions. The effects of quantum confinement on the band structures of the\n[111]-oriented InAs and InP nanowires are also examined and an empirical\nformula for the description of quantization energies of the lowest conduction\nband and the highest valence band is presented. The formula can simply be used\nto estimate the enhancement of the band gaps of the nanowires at different\nsizes as a result of quantum confinement.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1502.07566"]}]

After taking into account larger possible velocities in\nmore massive galaxies, we find that there is no difference in the velocity\ndispersions or column densities for absorption hosted by red galaxies with\n$D/R_{\\rm vir}$. Thus, a lack of outflows in red galaxies causes the CGM to\nbecome more quiescent over time, with lower velocity dispersions and larger\ncolumn densities towards lower $z_{\\rm gal}$. The quenching of star formation\nappears to affect the CGM out to $D/R_{\\rm vir}=0.75$.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables.

One important ingredient for many applications of nuclear physics\nto astrophysics, nuclear energy, and stockpile stewardship are cross sections\nfor reactions of neutrons with rare isotopes. Since direct measurements are\noften not feasible, indirect methods, e.g. (d,p) reactions, should be used.\nThose (d,p) reactions may be viewed as three-body reactions and described with\nFaddeev techniques. Purpose. Faddeev equations in momentum space have a long\ntradition of utilizing separable interactions in order to arrive at sets of\ncoupled integral equations in one variable. Optical potentials representing the\neffective interactions in the neutron (proton) nucleus subsystem are usually\nnon-Hermitian as well as energy-dependent. Potential matrix elements as well as\ntransition matrix elements calculated with them must fulfill the reciprocity\ntheorem. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a separable,\nenergy-dependent representation of complex, energy-dependent optical potentials\nthat fulfill reciprocity exactly. Results. Starting from a separable,\nenergy-independent representation of global optical potentials based on a\ngeneralization of the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST) scheme, a further\ngeneralization is needed to take into account the energy dependence.\nApplications to n$+^{48}$Ca, n$+^{208}$Pb, and p$+^{208}$Pb are investigated\nfor energies from 0 to 50~MeV with special emphasis on fulfilling reciprocity.\nConclusions. We find that the energy-dependent separable representation of\ncomplex, energy-dependent phenomenological optical potentials fulfills\nreciprocity exactly.

On a standard dataset of images we show significant\nimprovements in reconstruction results (both in terms of PSNR and time\ncomplexity) over state-of-the-art iterative CS reconstruction algorithms at\nvarious measurement rates. Further, through qualitative experiments on real\ndata collected using our block single pixel camera (SPC), we show that our\nnetwork is highly robust to sensor noise and can recover visually better\nquality images than competitive algorithms at extremely low sensing rates of\n0.1 and 0.04.

This is in contrast to popular assumptions in the literature that the\npresence of a compact, unresolved, nuclear radio continuum source universally\nsignifies the presence of an AGN. Additionally, we examine the relationships\nbetween the 5 GHz luminosity and various galaxy properties including the\nmolecular gas mass and - for the first time - the global kinematic state. We\ndiscuss implications for the growth, triggering, and fueling of radio AGNs, as\nwell as AGN-driven feedback in the continued evolution of nearby ETGs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 53 pages, 16 figures"]}]

The second\nrequirement for this network morphism is its ability to deal with non-linearity\nin a network. We propose a family of parametric-activation functions to\nfacilitate the morphing of any continuous non-linear activation neurons.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets and typical neural networks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network morphism scheme.\n","Comment: Under review for ICML 2016"]}]

The important factor\nthat controls the efficiency of EGO is the GP covariance function (or kernel)\nwhich should be chosen according to the objective function. Traditionally, a\npa-rameterized family of covariance functions is considered whose parameters\nare learned through statistical procedures such as maximum likelihood or\ncross-validation.

A practical implementation of the method for whole-Sun prediction of\nGeostationary Observational Environment Satellite (GOES) events is described in\ndetail, and is demonstrated for 4 November 2003, the day of the largest\nrecorded GOES flare. A test of the method is described based on the historical\nrecord of GOES events (1975-2003), and a detailed comparison is made with US\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predictions for\n1987-2003. Although the NOAA forecasts incorporate a variety of other\ninformation, the present method out-performs the NOAA method in predicting mean\nnumbers of event days, for both M-X and X events. Skill scores and other\nmeasures show that the present method is slightly less accurate at predicting\nM-X events than the NOAA method, but substantially more accurate at predicting\nX events, which are important contributors to space weather.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables"]}]

We\nspecifically target systems of dependent random variables, since that is where\nthe power of Stein's method is fully realized. Because the theory is quite\nabstract, we have tried to put in as many examples as possible. Some of the\nhighlighted applications are as follows: (a) We shall find an easily verifiable\ncondition under which a popular heuristic technique originating from physics,\nknown as the \"mean field equations\" method, is valid. No such condition is\ncurrently known. (b) We shall present a way of using couplings to derive\nconcentration inequalities. Although couplings are routinely used for proving\ndecay of correlations, no method for using couplings to derive concentration\nbounds is available in the literature. This will be used to obtain (c)\nconcentration inequalities with explicit constants under Dobrushin's condition\nof weak dependence. (d) We shall give a method for obtaining concentration of\nHaar measures using convergence rates of related random walks on groups. Using\nthis technique and one of the numerous available results about rates of\nconvergence of random walks, we will then prove (e) a quantitative version of\nVoiculescu's celebrated connection between random matrix theory and free\nprobability.\n","Comment: Author's Ph.D. thesis (Stanford University, June 2005).
