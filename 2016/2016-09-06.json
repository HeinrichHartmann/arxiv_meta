While the detection of such anomalous\nsubgraphs has received a substantial amount of attention, no\napplication-agnostic framework exists for analysis of signal detectability in\ngraph-based data. In this paper, we describe a framework that enables such\nanalysis using the principal eigenspace of a graph's residuals matrix, commonly\ncalled the modularity matrix in community detection. Leveraging this analytical\ntool, we show that the framework has a natural power metric in the spectral\nnorm of the anomalous subgraph's adjacency matrix (signal power) and of the\nbackground graph's residuals matrix (noise power). We propose several\nalgorithms based on spectral properties of the residuals matrix, with more\ncomputationally expensive techniques providing greater detection power.\nDetection and identification performance are presented for a number of signal\nand noise models, including clusters and bipartite foregrounds embedded into\nsimple random backgrounds as well as graphs with community structure and\nrealistic degree distributions. The trends observed verify intuition gleaned\nfrom other signal processing areas, such as greater detection power when the\nsignal is embedded within a less active portion of the background.

The\nresults are consistent with the reported pharmacological data on synaptic\nplasticity, and with previous claims of a prominent role of low-conductance\nNMDA receptors in layer 4 spiny stellate neurons, including broad integration,\namplification and distribution of excitation within the barrel in response to\nwhisker stimulation, as well as modulation of excitability by ambient\nglutamate. However, layer 4 cells also expressed high-conductance NMDA\nreceptors. The presence of low-conductance NMDA receptors in layer 2/3\npyramidal neurons suggests that some of these functions may be shared with\nlayer 4 spiny stellate neurons.\n"]}]

This paradigm implicitly assumes that rough variation is due to\nnuisance noise. Nevertheless, relevant functional features such as\ntime-localised or short scale fluctuations may indeed be rough relative to the\nglobal scale, but still smooth at shorter scales. These may be confounded with\nthe global smooth components of variation by the smoothing and PCA, potentially\ndistorting the parsimony and interpretability of the analysis. The goal of this\npaper is to investigate how both smooth and rough variations can be recovered\non the basis of discretely observed functional data. Assuming that a functional\ndatum arises as the sum of two uncorrelated components, one smooth and one\nrough, we develop identifiability conditions for the recovery of the two\ncorresponding covariance operators. The key insight is that they should possess\ncomplementary forms of parsimony: one smooth and low rank (large scale), and\nthe other banded and potentially high rank (small scale). Our conditions\nelucidate the precise interplay between rank, bandwidth, and grid resolution.\nUnder these conditions, we show that the recovery problem is equivalent to a\nlow rank matrix completion, and exploit this to construct estimators of the two\ncovariances, without assuming knowledge of the true bandwidth or rank; we\nestablish their consistency and rates of convergence, and use them to recover\nthe smooth and rough components of each functional datum by best linear\nprediction.

For weak anchoring, we recover the typical\nbehaviour of a sheared isotropic droplet in a binary fluid, which rotates,\nstretches and can be broken by the applied flow. For intermediate anchoring,\nnew possibilities arise due to elastic effects in the nematic fluid.

Instead of explicitly evaluating\nthe likelihood function, ABC approximates the posterior distribution by first\njointly sampling the parameter and data, and then accepting the pair based on\nthe distance between the data and the observation. The efficiency of the\nsampling depends on the distance function which itself depends on the\ndimensionality of the data.

This paper proposes Local Gradient Kernel Dimension Reduction (LGKDR) to\nconstruct low dimensional summary statistics that aims at sufficiency regarding\nthe parameters to be estimated. The proposed method identifies a linear\nsufficient subspace of the original summary statistics and applies a weighting\nkernel to concentrate on the local properties near the observation point.

The electric and diamagnetic polarizabilities of\na proton are $\\bar{\\alpha}_p= 10\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$, $\\beta_p^{dia}=-8\\times\n10^{-4} fm^3$ and for a neutron we find $\\bar{\\alpha}_n=4.2\\times 10^{-4} fm^3\n$, $\\beta_n^{dia}= -5.4\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$. Using the $\\Delta$ contribution to\nthe paramagnetic polarizability of the nucleons, reasonable values of the\nmagnetic polarizabilities $\\bar{\\beta}_p=(5\\pm 3)\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$,\n$\\bar{\\beta}_n=(7.6\\pm 3)\\times 10^{-4} fm^3$ are estimated.\n","Comment: 54 pages, LaTeX.

The production\nrate for such black holes has been extensively studied for the case of a\nproton-proton collision at \\sqrt s = 14 TeV and for a lead-lead collision at\n\\sqrt s = 5.5 TeV at LHC. As the parton energy density is much higher at\nlead-lead collisions than in pp collisions at LHC, one natural question is\nwhether the produced black holes will be able to absorb the partons formed in\nthe lead-lead collisions and eventually `eat' the quark-gluon plasma formed at\nLHC. In this paper, we make a quantitative analysis of this possibility and\nfind that since the energy density of partons formed in lead-lead collisions at\nLHC is about 500 GeV/fm^3, the rate of absorption for one of these black holes\nis much smaller than the rate of evaporation. Hence, we argue that black holes\nformed in such collisions will decay very quickly, and will not absorb very\nmany nearby partons. More precisely, we show that for the black hole mass to\nincrease via parton absorption at the LHC the typical energy density of quarks\nand gluons should be of the order of 10^{10} GeV/fm^3. As LHC will not be able\nto produce such a high energy density partonic system, the black hole will not\nbe able to absorb a sufficient number of nearby partons before it decays.

Dense baryonic matter is described as the ground state of a\nskyrmion matter which appears in two differentiated phases as a function of\nmatter density: i) at high densities as a stable cubic-centered (CC)\nhalf-skyrmion crystal; ii) at low densities as an unstable face-centered cubic\n(FCC) skyrmion crystal.

Since\nthese observables are affected significantly by colour-allowed electroweak (EW)\npenguins, this ``B -> pi K puzzle'' could be a manifestation of new physics in\nthe EW penguin sector. Performing the analysis in the R_n-R_c plane, which is\nvery suitable for monitoring various effects, we demonstrate that we may, in\nfact, move straightforwardly to the experimental region in this plane through\nan enhancement of the relevant EW penguin parameter q. We derive analytical\nbounds for q in terms of a quantity L, that measures the violation of the\nLipkin sum rule, and point out that strong phases around 90 deg are favoured by\nthe data, in contrast to QCD factorisation. The B -> pi K modes imply a\ncorrelation between q and the angle gamma that in the limit of negligible\nrescattering effects and colour suppressed EW penguins depends only on the\nvalue of L. Concentrating on a minimal flavour-violating new-physics scenario\nwith enhanced Z^0 penguins, we find that the current experimental values on\n  B -> X_s mu^+ mu^- require roughly L <= 1.8. As the B -> pi K data give L =\n5.7 +- 2.4, L has either to move to smaller values once the B -> pi K data\nimprove or new sources of flavour and CP violation are needed. In turn, the\nenhanced values of L seen in the B -> pi K data could be accompanied by\nenhanced branching ratios for rare decays. Most interesting turns out to be the\ncorrelation between the B -> pi K modes and BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nu), with the\nlatter depending approximately on a single ``scaling'' variable \\bar L= L\n(|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|/0.086)^2.3.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 7 figures, a few typos corrected and two references added"]}]

We strongly\nbelieve that our quantization of the Gaudin model coincides with quantization\nobtained from the center of universal enveloping algebra on the critical level\nand that our scalar G-oper coincides with the G-oper obtained by the geometric\nLanglands correspondence, hence it provides very simple and explicit map\n(Langlands correspondence) from Hitchin D-modules to G-opers in the case of\nrational base curves. It seems to be easy to generalize the constructions to\nthe case of other semisimple Lie algebras and models like XYZ.\n","Comment: 15 pages, the status of some statements changed"]}]

By means of a chain rule expansion,\nthe left and right derivatives are identified with the charge $Q$ and covariant\nderivative $D$ encountered in ordinary/fractional supersymmetry and this leads\nto new results for these operators. A generalized Berezin integral and\nfractional superspace measure arise as a natural part of our formalism. When\n$q$ is a root of unity the algebra is found to have a non-trivial Hopf\nstructure, extending that associated with the anyonic line. One-dimensional\nordinary/fractional superspace is identified with the braided line when $q$ is\na root of unity, so that one-dimensional ordinary/fractional supersymmetry can\nbe viewed as invariance under translation along this line. In our construction\nof fractional supersymmetry the $q$-deformed bosons play a role exactly\nanalogous to that of the fermions in the familiar supersymmetric case.\n","Comment: 42 pages, LaTeX.

Explicit quantum computations are carried\nout in genus one (torus). In particular the two-point function and the chiral\ncondensate are carefully derived for this case. Finally the effective\ngravitational action, coming from integrating out the fermionic degrees of\nfreedoom, is presented. It is different from the standard Liouville one: a new\nnon-local functional of the conformal factor arises and the central charge is\nimproved, depending also on the Thirring coupling constant. This last feature\nopens the possibility of giving a new explicit representation of the minimal\nseries in terms of a fermionic interacting model.\n","Comment: Latex, 41 Pages"]}]

These measures can be regarded as generalizations\nof the classical Shannon-Wiener information of a probability distribution into\nthe quantum regime. In the present work we introduce a previously unknown\napproach to the Shannon-Wiener information which provides an intuitive\ninterpretation for its functional form as well as putting all entanglement\nmeasures with a similar structure into a new context: By formalizing the\nprocess of information gaining in a set-theoretical language we arrive at a\nmathematical structure which we call ''tree structures'' over a given set. On\neach tree structure, a tree function can be defined, reflecting the degree of\nsplitting and branching in the given tree. We show in detail that the\nminimization of the tree function on, possibly constrained, sets of tree\nstructures renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener information. This\nfinding demonstrates that entropy-like information measures may themselves be\nunderstood as the result of a minimization process on a more general underlying\nmathematical structure, thus providing an entirely new interpretational\nframework to entropy-like measures of information and entanglement. We suggest\nthree natural axioms for defining tree structures, which turn out to be related\nto the axioms describing neighbourhood topologies on a topological space. The\nsame minimization that renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener\ninformation from the tree function then assigns a preferred topology to the\nunderlying set, hinting at a deep relation between entropy-like measures and\nneighbourhood topologies.\n","Comment: Many typos corrected, points clarified, new sections and theorems\n  added.

Does\nthere exists a one--to--one correspondence between ``real properties'' and\n``complex properties'' defining an operator ideal? In other words, does there\nexist for every real operator ideal a uniquely determined corresponding complex\nideal and vice versa?\n  Unfortunately, we are not abel to give a final answer. Nevertheless, some\npreliminary results are obtained. In particular, we construct for every real\noperator ideal a corresponding complex operator ideal and for every complex\noperator ideal a corresponding real one. However, we conjecture that there\nexists a complex operator ideal which can not be obtained from a real one by\nthis construction.\n  The following approach is based on the observation that every complex Banach\nspace can be viewed as a real Banach space with an isometry acting on it like\nthe scalar multiplication by the imaginary unit $i$.\n"]}]

Thomassen characterized the noneven,\n2-connected symmetric digraphs (i.e., digraphs for which the existence of arc\n$(u,v)$ implies the existence of arc $(v ,u))$. In the first part of our paper,\nwe recall this characterization and use it to determine which strong symmetric\ndigraphs allow symplectic pairs. A digraph $D$ is called {\\bf semi-complete}\nif, for each pair of distinct vertices $(u,v)$, at least one of the arcs\ndigraph. In the second part of our paper, we fill a gap in these two\ncharacterizations and present and prove correct versions of the main theorems\ninvolved. We then pr oceed to determine which digraphs from these classes allow\nsymplectic pairs. $(u,v)$ and $(v,u)$ exists in $D$. Thomassen presented a\ncharacterization of two classes of strong, noneven digraphs: the semi-complete\nclass and the class of digraphs for which each vertex has total degree which\nexceeds or equals the size of the digraph. In the second part of our paper, we\nfill a gap in these two characterizations and present and prove correct\nversions of the main theorems involved. We then p oceed to determine which\ndigraphs from these classes allow symplectic pairs.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]
