While self-testing results are known for\nseveral classes of states, in many cases they are only applicable if the\nobserved statistics are almost perfect, which makes them unsuitable for\npractical applications. Practically relevant self-testing bounds are much less\ncommon and moreover they all result from a single numerical method (with one\nexception which we discuss in detail). In this work we present a new technique\nfor proving analytic self-testing bounds of practically relevant robustness. We\nobtain improved bounds for the case of self-testing the singlet using the CHSH\ninequality (in particular we show that non-trivial fidelity with the singlet\ncan be achieved as long as the violation exceeds $\\beta^{*} = (16 + 14\n\\sqrt{2})/17 \\approx 2.11$). In case of self-testing the tripartite GHZ state\nusing the Mermin inequality we derive a bound which not only improves on\npreviously known results but turns out to be tight. We discuss other scenarios\nto which our technique can be immediately applied.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures. v2: fixed an inconsistency in specifying the\n  extraction channel, improved presentation; v3: published version"]}]

Two continuum velocity field quantities are introduced to facilitate\nthe discrete-to-continuum transition. The first one is the local migration\nvelocity of dislocation ensembles which is found fully independent of the\nshort-range dislocation correlations.

Recently the idea of planet(esimal)\ncollisions releasing splashes of lava droplets, long considered out of favor,\nhas been reconsidered as a possible origin of chondrules by several papers. One\nof the main problems with this idea is the lack of quantitative and simple\nmodels that can be used to test this scenario by directly comparing to the many\nknown observables of chondrules. In Paper I of this series we presented a\nsimple thermal evolution model of a spherically symmetric expanding cloud of\nmolten lava droplets that is assumed to emerge from a collision between two\nplanetesimals. In the present paper, number II of this series, we use this\nmodel to calculate whether or not volatile elements such as Na and K will\nremain abundant in these droplets or whether they will get depleted due to\nevaporation. The high density of the droplet cloud (e.g. small distance between\nadjacent droplets) causes the vapor to quickly reach saturation pressure and\nthus shutting down further evaporation. We show to which extent, and under\nwhich conditions, this keeps the abundances of these elements high, as is seen\nin chondrules. We find that for most parameters of our model (cloud mass,\nexpansion velocity, initial temperature) the volatile elements Mg, Si and Fe\nremain entirely in the chondrules. The Na and K abundances inside the droplets\nwill initially stay mostly at their initial values due to the saturation of the\nvapor pressure, but at some point start to drop due to the cloud expansion.\nHowever, as soon as the temperature starts to decrease, most or all of the\nvapor recondenses again. At the end the Na and K elements retain most of their\ninitial abundances, albeit occasionally somewhat reduced, depending on the\nparameters of the expanding cloud model.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

For the $d$-dimensional Euclidean\nspace and $n$-point datasets, we develop a data structure with space $n^{1 +\n\\rho_u + o(1)} + O(dn)$ and query time $n^{\\rho_q + o(1)} + d n^{o(1)}$ for\nevery $\\rho_u, \\rho_q \\geq 0$ such that: \\begin{equation} c^2 \\sqrt{\\rho_q} +\n(c^2 - 1) \\sqrt{\\rho_u} = \\sqrt{2c^2 - 1}. \\end{equation}\n  This is the first data structure that achieves sublinear query time and\nnear-linear space for every approximation factor $c > 1$, improving upon\n[Kapralov, PODS 2015]. The data structure is a culmination of a long line of\nwork on the problem for all space regimes; it builds on Spherical\nLocality-Sensitive Filtering [Becker, Ducas, Gama, Laarhoven, SODA 2016] and\ndata-dependent hashing [Andoni, Indyk, Nguyen, Razenshteyn, SODA 2014] [Andoni,\nRazenshteyn, STOC 2015].\n  Our matching lower bounds are of two types: conditional and unconditional.\nFirst, we prove tightness of the whole above trade-off in a restricted model of\ncomputation, which captures all known hashing-based approaches. We then show\nunconditional cell-probe lower bounds for one and two probes that match the\nabove trade-off for $\\rho_q = 0$, improving upon the best known lower bounds\nfrom [Panigrahy, Talwar, Wieder, FOCS 2010]. In particular, this is the first\nspace lower bound (for any static data structure) for two probes which is not\npolynomially smaller than the one-probe bound. To show the result for two\nprobes, we establish and exploit a connection to locally-decodable codes.\n","Comment: 60 pages, 5 figures; a merger of arXiv:1511.07527 [cs.DS] and\n  arXiv:1605.02701 [cs.DS], which subsumes both of the preprints"]}]
