The efficacy of delay-coordinate mapping has long been\nsupported by Takens' embedding theorem, which guarantees that delay-coordinate\nmaps use the time-series output to provide a reconstruction of the hidden state\nspace that is a one-to-one embedding of the system's attractor.

They are particularly suitable in\nnon-parametric settings, where the approximation error can be controlled, and\nprovide tighter bounds than the common technique of upper-bounding the 0-1 loss\nby the surrogate loss.\n  The abstract nature of the more sophisticated existing calibration function\nresults requires calibration functions to be explicitly derived on a\ncase-by-case basis, requiring repeated efforts whenever bounds for a new\nsurrogate loss are required. We devise a streamlined analysis that simplifies\nthe process of deriving calibration functions for a large number of surrogate\nlosses that have been proposed in the literature. The effort of deriving\ncalibration functions is then surmised in verifying, for a chosen surrogate\nloss, a small number of conditions that we introduce.\n  As case studies, we recover existing calibration functions for the well-known\nloss of Lee et al. (2004), and also provide novel calibration functions for\nwell-known losses, including the one-versus-all loss and the logistic\nregression loss, plus a number of other losses that have been shown to be\nclassification-calibrated in the past, but for which no calibration function\nhad been derived.\n","Comment: 44 pages"]}]

Even\nthough the formal framework of data exchange for relational database systems is\nwell-established, it does not immediately carry over to the setting of temporal\ndata, which necessitates reasoning over unbounded periods of time. In this\nwork, we study data exchange for temporal data. We first motivate the need for\ntwo views of temporal data: the concrete view, which depicts how temporal data\nis compactly represented and on which implementations are based, and the\nabstract view, which defines the semantics of temporal data. We show how the\nframework of data exchange can be systematically extended to temporal data.

The recognition is based on the\n(self)adjustable identification of kinetically hot residues, i.e., residues\nwith highest contributions to the weighted sum of fastest modes per chain\nextracted via GNM, and their connection to possible binding scaffolds. The\nalgorithm adjusts the number of modes used in the GNM's weighted sum\ncalculation using the ratio of predicted and expected numbers of target\nresidues (contact and first layer residues). This approach produces very good\nresults when applied to chains forming heterodimers, especially with dimers\nwith high chain length ratios.

The\nreason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an\nalmost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep\nradiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are\nquantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in flat\nspace-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling\nconstants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum effects\nmight dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at\nleast up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial\nconditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always\npossible to find a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy\nsolution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of\ninitial conditions that best fit current data, and assuming that the galileon\neffective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found\nthat the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than $10^8 \\\n{\\rm GeV}$.

Among many surprising properties of QCs is their high catalytic\nactivity. We propose a mechanism explaining this peculiarity based on unusual\ndynamics of atoms at special sites in QCs, namely, localized anharmonic\nvibrations (LAVs) and phasons. In the former case, one deals with a large\namplitude (~ fractions of an angstrom) time-periodic oscillations of a small\ngroup of atoms around their stable positions in the lattice, known also as\ndiscrete breathers, which can be excited in regular crystals as well as in QCs.\nOn the other hand, phasons are a specific property of QCs, which are\nrepresented by very large amplitude (~angstrom) oscillations of atoms be-tween\ntwo quasi-stable positions determined by the geometry of a QC. Large amplitude\natomic motion in LAVs and phasons results in time-periodic driving of adjacent\npotential wells occupied by hydrogen ions (protons or deuterons) in case of\nhydrogenated QCs. This driving may result in the increase of amplitude and\nenergy of zero-point vibrations (ZPV). Based on that, we demonstrate a drastic\nincrease of the D-D or D-H fusion rate with increasing number of modulation\nperiods evaluated in the framework of Schwinger model, which takes into account\nsuppression of the Coulomb barrier due to lattice vibrations. In this context,\nwe present numerical solution of Schrodinger equation for a particle in a\nnon-stationary double well potential, which is driven time-periodically\nimitating the action of a LAV or phason. We show that the rate of tunneling of\nthe particle through the potential barrier separating the wells is enhanced\ndrastically by the driving, and it increases strongly with increasing amplitude\nof the driving. These results support the concept of nuclear catalysis in QCs\nthat can take place at special sites provided by their inherent topology.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures, Int.

Our approach is premised on a simple observation: applications view\nstorage systems as black-boxes that transition through a series of states, a\nsubset of which are observed by applications. For maximum clarity, isolation\nand consistency guarantees should be expressed as constraints on those states.\nInstead, these properties are currently expressed as constraints on operation\nhistories that are not visible to the application. We show that adopting a\nstate-based approach to expressing these guarantees brings forth several\nbenefits. First, it makes it easier to focus on the anomalies that a given\nisolation or consistency level allows (and that applications must deal with),\nrather than those that it proscribes. Second, it unifies the often disparate\ntheories of isolation and consistency and provides a structure for composing\nthese guarantees. We leverage this modularity to apply to transactions\n(independently of the isolation level under which they execute) the equivalence\nbetween causal consistency and session guarantees that Chockler et al. had\nproved for single operations. Third, it brings clarity to the increasingly\ncrowded field of proposed consistency and isolation properties by winnowing\nspurious distinctions: we find that the recently proposed parallel snapshot\nisolation introduced by Sovran et al. is in fact a specific implementation of\nan older guarantee, lazy consistency (or PL-2+), introduced by Adya et al.\n","Comment: 11 pages with 29 pages appendix"]}]

The second gives moment control on the H\\\"older\nconstant of the local times, uniformly across a compact spatial interval and in\ncertain random time intervals. For the latter, we introduce the notion of a\nL\\'evy process restricted to a compact interval, which is a variation of\nLambert's L\\'evy process confined in a finite interval and of Pistorius' doubly\nreflected process. We use the results of this paper to exhibit a class of\npath-continuous branching processes of Crump-Mode-Jagers type with continuum\ngenealogical structure. A further motivation for this study lies in the\nconstruction of diffusion processes in spaces of interval partitions and\nR-trees, which we explore in forthcoming articles.\n","Comment: 27 pages"]}]
