We do this\nexplicitly for the often-studied example Abelian category of finitely presented\nmodules over a so-called computable ring $R$, i.e., a ring with an explicit\nalgorithm to solve one-sided (in)homogeneous linear systems over $R$. For a\nfinitely generated maximal ideal $\\mathfrak{m}$ in a commutative ring $R$ we\nshow how solving (in)homogeneous linear systems over $R_{\\mathfrak{m}}$ can be\nreduced to solving associated systems over $R$. Hence, the computability of $R$\nimplies that of $R_{\\mathfrak{m}}$. As a corollary we obtain the computability\nof the category of finitely presented $R_{\\mathfrak{m}}$-modules as an Abelian\ncategory, without the need of a Mora-like algorithm.

The analysis of\nDWS data requires knowledge of the path length distribution of photons\ntraveling through the sample. While for flat sample cells this path length\ndistribution can be readily expressed in analytical form, no such expression is\navailable for cylindrical sample cells. DWS measurements have therefore\ntypically relied on dedicated setups that use flat sample cells. Here we show\nhow DWS measurements, in particular DWS-based microrheology measurements, can\nbe performed in standard dynamic light scattering setups that use cylindrical\nsample cells.

Using a single\nsample cell, this gives access to a wider range of length and time scales than\nobtained in a conventional DWS setup. Such angle-dependent measurements also\noffer an important consistency check, as for all detection angles the DWS\nanalysis should yield the same tracer dynamics, even though the respective path\nlength distributions are very different.

Our definition of the graph shift operator negates\nthe shift operators defined in the literature, such as the graph adjacency\nmatrix and Laplacian matrix based shift operators, which modify the energy of a\ngraph signal. We decouple the graph structure represented by eigengraphs and\nthe eigenvalues of the adjacent matrix or the Laplacian matrix. We show that\nthe adjacency matrix of a graph is indeed a linear shift invariant (LSI) graph\nfilter with respect to the defined shift operator. We introduce graph finite\nimpulse response (GFIR) and graph infinite impulse response (GIIR) filters and\nobtain explicit forms for such filters. We further define autocorrelation and\ncross-correlation functions of signals on the graph, which enable us obtain the\nsolution to optimal filtering on graphs, i.e., the corresponding Wiener\nfiltering on graphs and the efficient spectra analysis and frequency domain\nfiltering in parallel with those in classical signal processing. This new shift\noperator based GSP framework enables the signal analysis along a correlation\nstructure defined by a graph shift manifold as opposed to classical signal\nprocessing operating on the assumption of the correlation structure with a\nlinear time shift manifold. We further provides the solution to the optimal\nlinear predictor problem over general graphs.

While bluff provides clear, but risky\nadvantage, overconfidence, as a form of self-deception, could be harmful to its\nuser. Still, it is a long-standing puzzle why these potentially damaging biases\nare maintained and evolving to a high level in the human society.

Moreover, topological feature of the social network\nplays an intricate role in the spreading of overconfidence and bluffing. While\nthe heterogeneity of interactions facilitates bluffing, it also increases\nefficiency of adequate punishment against overconfident behavior.

Pressure\nand velocity are expressed in the form of piecewise polynomials along different\nmeshes. While the pressure is defined on the control volumes of the main grid,\nthe velocity components are defined on a spatially staggered mesh. In the first\nfamily, h.o. of accuracy is achieved only in space, while a simple\nsemi-implicit time discretization is derived for the pressure gradient in the\nmomentum equation. The resulting linear system for the pressure is symmetric\nand positive definite and either block 5-diagonal (2D) or block 7-diagonal (3D)\nand can be solved very efficiently by means of a classical matrix-free\nconjugate gradient method. The use of a preconditioner was not necessary. This\nis a rather unique feature among existing implicit DG schemes for the NS\nequations.

The second family of staggered DG\nschemes achieves h.o. of accuracy also in time by expressing the numerical\nsolution in terms of piecewise space-time polynomials. In order to circumvent\nthe low order of accuracy of the adopted fractional stepping, a simple\niterative Picard procedure is introduced.

The matrix\noperations, associated with both training and testing of deep networks, are\nvery expensive from a computational and energy standpoint. We present a novel\nhashing based technique to drastically reduce the amount of computation needed\nto train and test deep networks. Our approach combines recent ideas from\nadaptive dropouts and randomized hashing for maximum inner product search to\nselect the nodes with the highest activation efficiently. Our new algorithm for\ndeep learning reduces the overall computational cost of forward and\nback-propagation by operating on significantly fewer (sparse) nodes. As a\nconsequence, our algorithm uses only 5% of the total multiplications, while\nkeeping on average within 1% of the accuracy of the original model. A unique\nproperty of the proposed hashing based back-propagation is that the updates are\nalways sparse. Due to the sparse gradient updates, our algorithm is ideally\nsuited for asynchronous and parallel training leading to near linear speedup\nwith increasing number of cores. We demonstrate the scalability and\nsustainability (energy efficiency) of our proposed algorithm via rigorous\nexperimental evaluations on several real datasets.\n"]}]

A simple microstructural model is used to predict\nmacroscopic fracture initiation. The simplicity of the model ensures highly\nefficient computations, enabling an comprehensive study: a large range of hard\nphase volume fractions and yield stress ratios, for wide range of applied\nstress states. Each combination of these parameters is analyzed using a large\nset of (random) microstructures. It is observed that only one of the phases\ndominates macroscopic fracture initiation: at low stress triaxiality the soft\nphase is dominant, but above a critical triaxiality the hard phase takes over\nresulting in a strong decrease in ductility. This transition is strongly\ndependent on microstructural parameters. If the hard phase volume fraction is\nsmall, the fracture initiation is dominated by the soft phase even at high\nphase contrast. At higher hard phase volume fraction, the hard phase dominates\nalready at low phase contrast. This simple model thereby reconciles\nexperimental observations from the literature for a specific combination of\nparameters, which may have triggered contradictory statements in the past. A\nmicroscopic analysis reveals that the average phase distribution around\nfracture initiation sites is nearly the same for the two failure mechanisms.\nAlong the tensile direction, regions of the hard phase are found directly next\nto the fracture initiation site.

Instead, one\nhas access to multiple corrupted versions of the signal. The available\ncorrupted signals are correlated because they carry information about the\ncommon remote signal. The goal is to reconstruct the original signal from the\ndata collected from its corrupted versions. The information theoretic\nformulation of the remote reconstruction problem assumes that the corrupted\nsignals are uniformly sampled and the focus is on optimal compression of the\nsamples. In this paper we revisit this problem from a sampling perspective. We\nlook at the problem of finding the best sampling locations for each signal to\nminimize the total reconstruction distortion of the remote signal. In finding\nthe sampling locations, one can take advantage of the correlation among the\ncorrupted signals. Our main contribution is a fundamental lower bound on the\nreconstruction distortion for any arbitrary nonuniform sampling strategy. This\nlower bound is valid for any sampling rate. Furthermore, it is tight and\nmatches the optimal reconstruction distortion in low and high sampling rates.\nMoreover, it is shown that in the low sampling rate region, it is optimal to\nuse a certain nonuniform sampling scheme on all the signals. On the other hand,\nin the high sampling rate region, it is optimal to uniformly sample all the\nsignals. We also consider the problem of finding the optimal sampling locations\nto recover the set of corrupted signals, rather than the remote signal. Unlike\nthe information theoretic formulation of the problem in which these two\nproblems were equivalent, we show that they are not equivalent in our setting.\n","Comment: Under review"]}]

Previous studies of this type\ntreated the NS core as a normal fluid and thus did not account for its expected\nsuperfluidity. The source of buoyancy that supports the g modes is\nfundamentally different in the two cases: in a normal fluid core the buoyancy\nis due to gradients in the proton-to-neutron fraction whereas in a superfluid\ncore it is due to gradients in the muon-to-electron fraction. The latter yields\na stronger stratification and a superfluid NS therefore has a denser spectrum\nof g modes with frequencies above 10 Hz. As a result, many more g modes undergo\nresonant tidal excitation as the binary sweeps through the bandwidth of GW\ndetectors such as LIGO. We find that roughly 10 times more orbital energy is\ntransferred into g mode oscillations if the NS has a superfluid core rather\nthan a normal fluid core. However, because this energy is transferred later in\nthe inspiral when the orbital decay is faster, the accumulated phase error in\nthe gravitational waveform is comparable for a superfluid and a normal fluid NS\n(about 0.001-0.01 rad).

In this paper the author models the approach to\nequilibrium function by a method that allows the physical quantities to be\ndefined beforehand, allows their influence to be studied, and can be used to\npredict how each physical quantity affects approach to equilibrium. Methods: An\nordinary differential equation (ODE) is used to model the approach to\nequilibrium function for the case where collimation is changed at fixed\ndetector size. A parallel model is used to study the approach to equilibrium as\na function of detector size for fixed collimation. Both models are validated by\nexperimental measurements in a 60cm body phantom. Influence of detector size is\nsimulated by using leaded sleeves of varying sizes wrapped around a 100mm\npencil chamber. This creates sleeve gaps of 10 - 60mm around the chamber. A\n100mm detector size is the pencil chamber without a leaded sleeve. Results:\nModel accurately describes the experimental data for the cases studied.

Although a conventional perspective\nsuggests that delocalized states act as a thermalizing bath for the localized\nstates in the presence of of interactions, there is evidence that such systems\ncan display non-ergodicity. This is in part due to the fact that the\ndelocalized states do not have any kind of protection due to symmetry or\ntopology and are thus susceptible to localization. A study of non-interacting\nincommensurate models shows that they admit extended, partially extended, and\nfully localized many-body states. These models cannot thermalize dynamically\nand remain localized upon the introduction of interactions. In particular, for\na certain range of energy, the system can host a non-ergodic extended (i.e.\nmetallic) phase in which the energy eigenstates violate the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH) but the entanglement entropy obeys volume-law\nscaling. The level statistics and entanglement growth also indicate the lack of\nergodicity in these models. The phenomenon of localization and non-ergodicity\nin a system with interactions despite the presence of single-particle\ndelocalized states is closely related to the so-called \"many-body proximity\neffect\" and can also be observed in models with disorder coupled to systems\nwith delocalized degrees of freedom.

We therefore discuss a set of new control procedures that are\nbetter suited and integrated them in our system called Aware. By means of\nextensive experiments using both real-world and synthetic data sets we\ndemonstrate how Aware can help experts and novice users alike to efficiently\ncontrol false discoveries.\n"]}]

The two players are required to output two\nelements, without any interaction, sampled according to their respective\ndistributions, while trying to minimize the probability that their outputs\ndisagree. A well-known protocol due to Holenstein, with close variants (for\nsimilar problems) due to Broder, and to Kleinberg and Tardos, solves this task\nwith disagreement probability at most $2 \\delta/(1+\\delta)$, where $\\delta$ is\nthe total variation distance between $P$ and $Q$. This protocol has been used\nin several different contexts including sketching algorithms, approximation\nalgorithms based on rounding linear programming relaxations, the study of\nparallel repetition and cryptography.\n  In this note, we give a surprisingly simple proof that this protocol is in\nfact tight.

On the other hand, if the characteristic size of a fluidic system\nis reduced to a range comparable to the microscopic regularization length\nscale, the assumption that viscous effects are localized near the contact line\nis no longer justified. In the present work, such microscopic length is the\nslip length. We investigate the dewetting of a droplet using the boundary\nelement method.

Around $\\tilde{b}_m$, the early time evolution of\nthe profiles at the rim can be described by similarity solutions. The results\nare explained in terms of the structure of the flow field governed by different\ndissipation channels: viscous elongational flows for large slip lengths,\nfriction at the substrate for intermediate slip lengths, and viscous shear\nflows for small slip lengths.

Radiation therapy employs several beams of ionizing radiation to\nkill cancer tumors, but such irradiation also causes damage to normal tissues.\nTherefore, a treatment plan should satisfy dose-volume constraints (DVCs).\nIntensity-modulated radiotherapy treatment (IMRT) enables to control the beam\nintensities and gives more flexibility for the treatment plan to satisfy the\nDVCs. Romeijn et al. (2003) replaced the DVCs in an IMRT optimization with\nC-VaR (Conditional Value-at-Risk) type constraints, and proposed a numerical\nmethod based on linear programming (LP).

The majority of countries in Africa and nearly one third of all\ncountries require mortality models to infer complete age schedules of\nmortality, required for population estimates, projections/forecasts and many\nother tasks in demography and epidemiology. Models that relate child mortality\nto mortality at other ages are important because all countries have measures of\nchild mortality.\n  OBJECTIVE. 1) Design a general model for age-specific mortality that provides\na standard way to relate covariates to age-specific mortality. 2) Calibrate\nthat model using the relationship between child or child/adult mortality and\nmortality at other ages. 3) Validate the calibrated model and compare its\nperformance to existing models.\n  METHODS. A general, parametrizable component model of mortality is designed\nusing the singular value decomposition (SVD-Comp) and calibrated to the\nrelationship between child or child/adult mortality and mortality at other ages\nin the observed mortality schedules of the Human Mortality Database. Cross\nvalidation is used to validate the model, and the predictive performance of the\nmodel is compared to that of the Log-Quad model, designed to do the same thing.\n  RESULTS. Prediction and cross validation tests indicate that the child\nmortality-calibrated SVD-Comp is able to accurately represent the observed\nmortality schedules in the Human Mortality Database, is robust to the selection\nof mortality schedules used to calibrate it, and performs better than the\nLog-Quad Model.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The child mortality-calibrated SVD-Comp is a useful tool that\ncan be used where child mortality is available but mortality at other ages is\nunknown. Together with earlier work on an HIV prevalence-calibrated version of\nSVD-Comp, this work suggests that this approach is truly general and could be\nused to develop a wide range of additional useful models.\n"]}]

The objective is to\nminimize the total power consumption of the network while satisfying the\nquality of service (QoS) requirements of each connected user. We consider the\ncase of co-existing macrocell BS, small cell BSs, and private femtocell access\npoints (FAPs).

A unified framework is proposed to\nsimultaneously allocate spectrum resources to users in an energy efficient\nmanner and switch off redundant small cell BSs. The high complexity dual\ndecomposition technique is employed to achieve optimal solutions for the\nproblem. A low complexity iterative algorithm is also proposed and its\nperformances are compared to those of the optimal technique. The particularly\ninteresting case of semi-closed FAPs, in which the FAPs accept to serve\nexternal users, achieves the highest energy efficiency due to increased degrees\nof freedom.

The former bases its decisions\nsolely on the past channel state information and the latter follows a\nmax-weight queue-based policy. The performance of the algorithms are analyzed\nusing the frameworks of rate-stability in networks of queues, max-flow min-cut\nduality in networks, and finite-horizon Lyapunov drift analysis. When the state\nis hidden, the capacity region does not have a single-letter characterization\nand is, in this sense, uncomputable. Approximations of the capacity region are\nprovided and two optimal coding algorithms are outlined. The first algorithm is\na probabilistic coding scheme that bases its decisions on the past L feedback\nsequences and its achievable rate-region approaches the capacity region\nexponentially fast in L. The second algorithm is a backpressure-like algorithm\nthat performs optimally in the long run.\n"]}]

An unprecedented separation power between photon and hadron\nprimaries is achieved by combining measurements of the longitudinal air-shower\ndevelopment with the particle content at ground measured by the fluorescence\nand surface detectors, respectively. Only three photon candidates at energies 1\n- 2 EeV are found, which is compatible with the expected hadron-induced\nbackground. Upper limits on the integral flux of ultra-high energy photons of\n0.027, 0.009, 0.008, 0.008 and 0.007 km$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ are derived\nat 95% C.L. for energy thresholds of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 EeV. These limits bound\nthe fractions of photons in the all-particle integral flux below 0.1%, 0.15%,\n0.33%, 0.85% and 2.7%. For the first time the photon fraction at EeV energies\nis constrained at the sub-percent level. The improved limits are below the flux\nof diffuse photons predicted by some astrophysical scenarios for cosmogenic\nphoton production. The new results rule-out the early top-down models $-$ in\nwhich ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced by, e.g., the decay of\nsuper-massive particles $-$ and challenge the most recent super-heavy dark\nmatter models.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 6 figures, to be submitted to JCAP"]}]

Their\ninfluence spans from DNA and molecular chemistry to vortices in superfluid\nhelium, defects in liquid crystals and cosmic strings in the early universe.\nHere, we find that knotted structures also exist in a peculiar class of\nthree-dimensional topological insulators---the Hopf insulators. In particular,\nwe demonstrate that the momentum-space spin textures of Hopf insulators are\ntwisted in a nontrivial way, which implies the presence of various knot and\nlink structures. We further illustrate that the knots and nontrivial spin\ntextures can be probed via standard time-of-flight images in cold atoms as\npreimage contours of spin orientations in stereographic coordinates. The\nextracted Hopf invariants, knots, and links are validated to be robust to\ntypical experimental imperfections.
