If quantum bits (qubits) are sufficiently\nreliable, errors are sparse and quantum error correction (QEC) is capable of\nidentifying and correcting them. Adding more qubits improves the preservation\nby guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters of errors will not cause logical\nfailure - a key requirement for large-scale systems. Using QEC to extend the\nqubit lifetime remains one of the outstanding experimental challenges in\nquantum computing. Here, we report the protection of classical states from\nenvironmental bit-flip errors and demonstrate the suppression of these errors\nwith increasing system size. We use a linear array of nine qubits, which is a\nnatural precursor of the two-dimensional surface code QEC scheme, and track\nerrors as they occur by repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition\n(QND) parity measurements. Relative to a single physical qubit, we reduce the\nfailure rate in retrieving an input state by a factor of 2.7 for five qubits\nand a factor of 8.5 for nine qubits after eight cycles. Additionally, we\ntomographically verify preservation of the non-classical\nGreenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state.

It has been found that the critical temperature\n($T_{C}$) decreases from $7$ K to $3.9$ K. The ratio of the energy gap to the\ncritical temperature: $R_{\\Delta}=2\\Delta\\left(0\\right)/k_{B}T_{C}$, differs\nsignificantly from the BCS value: $R_{\\Delta}\\in\\left<4.4,3.95\\right>$.\nSimilarly behaves the ratio of the specific heat jump to the specific heat of\nthe normal state: $R_{C}=\\Delta C\\left(T_{C}\\right)/C^{N}\\left(T_{C}\\right)$,\nand the parameter:\n$R_{H}=T_{C}C^{N}\\left(T_{C}\\right)/H^{2}_{C}\\left(0\\right)$, where\n$H_{C}\\left(0\\right)$ is the thermodynamic critical field. In particular,\n$R_{C}\\in\\left<2.2,1.75\\right>$ and $R_{H}\\in\\left<0.141,0.154\\right>$.\n"]}]
