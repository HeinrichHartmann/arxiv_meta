Our\nresults have been compared with direct measurements, and indirect estimates\nbased on spectrophotometric methods, and general agreement is found within the\ncombined uncertainties. The stars in our list cover the range K=-2.9 to +3.0\nmag in brightness, and 1.3 to 20.5 milliarcseconds in uniform-disk diameter.\nThe relative accuracy of the angular diameter values is on average 0.4% and 2%\nfor the primary and secondary calibrators respectively. Our calibrators are\nwell suited for interferometric observations in the near-infrared on baselines\nbetween ~20m and ~200m, and their accuracy is superior, at least for the\nprimary calibrators, to other similar catalogues. Therefore, the present list\nof calibrators has the potential to lead to significantly improved\ninterferometric scientific results.\n"]}]

For a class containing potentials with\nweak-$L^3$ attractive and locally weak-$L^3$ repulsive parts, if there is any\nsingle-particle potential in that class having a given density as\nground-density, then it is unique up to a constant over the region where the\ndensity does not vanish. For a class of potentials including Kato class, the\npotential is unique up to a constant, if the density is everywhere nonzero.\nAlong the way, an elementary and self-contained proof is given for molecular\npotentials of the classic (strong) HK property, uniqueness of the external\npotential up to a global constant.\n","Comment: v3: major improvements of the results in this version"]}]

One of the main difficulties is to\ncapture a suitable notion of work that models realistically the purpose of\nquantum machines, in an analogous way to the role played, for macroscopic\nmachines, by the energy stored in the idealisation of a lifted weight. Despite\nof several attempts to resolve this issue by putting forward specific models,\nthese are far from capturing realistically the transitions that a quantum\nmachine is expected to perform.

Each mobile device is primarily\nused by a single user, so it's possible to have a personalized recognizer well\nmatching to the characteristics of individual user. Although acoustic model\npersonalization has been investigated for decades, much less work have been\nreported on personalizing language model, probably because of the difficulties\nin collecting enough personalized corpora. Previous work used the corpora\ncollected from social networks to solve the problem, but constructing a\npersonalized model for each user is troublesome. In this paper, we propose a\nuniversal recurrent neural network language model with user characteristic\nfeatures, so all users share the same model, except each with different user\ncharacteristic features. These user characteristic features can be obtained by\ncrowdsouring over social networks, which include huge quantity of texts posted\nby users with known friend relationships, who may share some subject topics and\nwording patterns. The preliminary experiments on Facebook corpus showed that\nthis proposed approach not only drastically reduced the model perplexity, but\noffered very good improvement in recognition accuracy in n-best rescoring\ntests.

However, they require manual alignment of such\nimage pairs. Fully unsupervised adaptation methods rely on minimizing the\ndiscrepancy between the feature distributions across domains. We propose a\nnovel, more powerful combination of both distribution and pairwise image\nalignment, and remove the requirement for expensive annotation by using weakly\naligned pairs of images in the source and target domains. Focusing on adapting\nfrom simulation to real world data using a PR2 robot, we evaluate our approach\non a manipulation task and show that by using weakly paired images, our method\ncompensates for domain shift more effectively than previous techniques,\nenabling better robot performance in the real world.\n"]}]

However we find that in case of DUNE\nbaseline, the antineutrino runs help even in parameter space where the\nantineutrino probabilities suffer from degeneracies.

This paper addresses the design concept for a novel\noptomechanical device capable of ultrahigh quality factors in the audio\nfrequency band with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a\nminimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror\nSloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a\nMembrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the\nhigh-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms\nwhich lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation\npressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using\nthe Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical\ntrapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most\nimportant being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that\npractical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0.1 Hz,\ncould achieve a maximum quality factor of $10^{14}$ with optical spring\nstiffened frequency 1-10 kHz.

Horizontal moisture advection\nmodulates the extreme events mainly by setting the environmental humidity,\nwhich modulates the amplitude of the convection's response to the dynamic\nforcings.

No new transients are found, allowing us to set\nstringent upper limits on transients at milliJansky levels and at low\nfrequencies where comparatively few such surveys have been carried out to date.\nAn all-sky isotropic rate of bursting radio transients with similar rates,\nduration, and intensity as the unusual transient GCRT J1745$-$3009, discovered\nin wide-field monitoring toward the Galactic center, is ruled out with high\nconfidence. The resulting non-detections allows us to argue that this is a\ncoherent source, whose properties most resemble the growing class of nulling\npulsars. We end with a discussion of the future prospects for the detection of\ntransients by VLITE and other experiments.\n","Comment: submitted to ApJ"]}]

Based on\ntwo-dimensional horizontal particle image velocimetry (PIV) data, and infrared\ncamera visualizations, we describe the appearance and the characteristics of\nthe baroclinic instability in this original configuration. First, we show that\nwhen the salinity profile is linear and confined between two non stratified\nlayers at top and bottom, only two separate shallow fluid layers can be\ndestabilized.

This laboratory\narrangement is thus particularly interesting to model geophysical or\nastrophysical situations where stratified regions are often juxtaposed to\nconvective ones. Then, for more general but stable initial density profiles,\nstatistical measures are introduced to quantify the extent of the baroclinic\ninstability at given depths and to analyze the connections between this\ndepth-dependence and the vertical salinity profiles. We find that, although the\npresence of stable stratification generally hinders full-depth overturning,\ndouble-diffusive convection can yield development of multicellular sideways\nconvection in shallow layers and subsequently to a multilayered baroclinic\ninstability. Therefore we conclude that by decreasing the characteristic\nvertical scale of the flow, stratification may even enhance the formation of\ncyclonic and anticyclonic eddies (and thus, mixing) in a local sense.\n"]}]

The observed spreading phenomenon can be\nroughly explained as a heterogeneous diffusion-reaction process by redefining\nmobility distance according to the human mobility volume between nodes, which\nis beyond the geometrical viewpoint. However, the heterogeneity of human\ndynamics still poses challenges to precise prediction.\n"]}]

By modifying the parallel gradient operator to\ninclude perpendicular perturbations from poloidal field coils, numerical\nsingularities associated with field aligned coordinates are avoided. A\ncomparison with a previously developed analytical model is performed and an\nagreement is found with minimal modification. Experimental comparison\ndetermines that the null region can cause an acceleration of filaments due to\nincreasing connection length, but this acceleration is small relative to other\neffects, which we quantify.

Given a family of\nfilters, defined as a distribution over pairs of subsets of space with certain\nlocality-sensitivity properties, we can solve the approximate near neighbor\nproblem in $d$-dimensional space for an $n$-point data set with query time\n$dn^{\\rho_q+o(1)}$, update time $dn^{\\rho_u+o(1)}$, and space usage $dn + n^{1\n+ \\rho_u + o(1)}$. The space-time tradeoff is tied to the tradeoff between\nquery time and update time, controlled by the exponents $\\rho_q, \\rho_u$ that\nare determined by the filter family. Locality-sensitive filtering was\nintroduced by Becker et al.

All massive\nhigher-spin fields are described gauge invariantly in terms of St\\\"ueckelberg\nfields. The spectrum depends on the boundary conditions imposed at both ends of\nthe wedges. We obseved that higher-derivative boundary condition is inevitable\nfor spin greater than three. For some higher-derivative boundary conditions,\nequivalently, spectrum-dependent boundary conditions, we get a non-unitary\nrepresentation of partially-massless higher-spin fields of varying depth. We\npresent intuitive picture which higher-derivative boundary conditions yield\nnon-unitary system in terms of boundary action. We argue that isotropic\nLifshitz interfaces in $O(N)$ Heisenberg magnet or $O(N)$ Gross-Neveu model\nprovides the holographic dual conformal field theory and propose experimental\ntest of (inverse) Higgs mechanism for massive and partially massless\nhigher-spin fields.\n","Comment: v1. 62 pages, 7 figures, v2. 68 pages, 8 figures, published version"]}]

During metaphase in the early C. elegans embryo, the spindle\nis aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior axis by a\nmicrotubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the spindle\nis displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability of\ncentering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle\nduring the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We\nfound that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the\ntransverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured\nby the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the\ncell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the\nfluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of\nthe short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by fluctuations\nin the number of independent motor elements such as microtubules or dyneins\nunderlying the centering machinery, we infer that the number is on the order of\none thousand, consistent with the several thousand of astral microtubules in\nthese cells. Astral microtubules grow out from the two spindle poles, make\ncontact with the cell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high\nstability of centering can be accounted for quantitatively if, while making\ncontact with the cortex, the astral microtubules buckle as they exert\ncompressive, pushing forces.

The\nlatter theory also has a dual version as a fermion interacting with some gauge\nfields. Assuming some of these dualities, other dualities can be derived. Our\nanalysis resolves a number of confusing issues in the literature including how\ntime reversal is realized in these theories. It also has many applications in\ncondensed matter physics like the theory of topological insulators (and their\ngapped boundary states) and the problem of electrons in the lowest Landau level\nat half filling. (Our techniques also clarify some points in the fractional\nHall effect and its description using flux attachment.) In addition to\npresenting several consistency checks, we also present plausible (but not\nrigorous) derivations of the dualities and relate them to $3+1$-dimensional\n$S$-duality.\n","Comment: 65 pages, 2 figures, minor changes, added references"]}]

The function is generalized for\nrandom and regular packing of multi-layered spheres, where the range of\npossible values of Ra is studied, along with the optimal values to create\nmaximum base roughness.

Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation we\nderive an effective Kondo model with couplings between the bulk and impurity\nelectrons expressed in terms of spin, orbital, and orbital quadrupole\noperators. The bare spin-spin Kondo interaction is much smaller than the\norbit-orbit and spin-orbital couplings or is even ferromagnetic. Furthermore,\nthe perturbative scaling equations indicate faster renormalization of the\ncouplings related to orbital degrees of freedom compared to spin degrees of\nfreedom. Both mechanisms lead to a slow screening of the local spin moment. The\nmodel thus behaves similarly to the related quantum impurity problem with a\nlarger SU(3) orbital symmetry (Dworin-Narath interaction) where this was first\nobserved. We find that the two problems actually describe the same low-energy\nphysics since the SU(3) symmetry is dynamically established through the\nrenormalization of the splittings of coupling constants to zero.

The numerical results,\nwith more than $10$-digit accuracy, show quantitatively that the modal\nconfinement loss of the rectangular waveguide increases exponentially fast as\nthe cladding thickness decreases.\n"]}]

Consequently, the electron transport is enhanced due to\nactivation of photon replica states.

This is a secondary hair, meaning that it does\nnot endow the black hole with new quantum numbers. It rather consists of a\nnon-trivial scalar field profile of fixed intensity which turns out to be\nregular everywhere outside and on the horizon and, provided the cosmological\nconstant is negative, behaves at large distance in a way compatible with the\nAnti-de Sitter (AdS) asymptotic.

The conformal coupling to matter in dimension $D>4$ in principle\nincludes higher-curvature terms. These couplings are obtained from the Lovelock\naction through the Stueckelberg strategy. As a consequence, the resulting\nscalar-tensor theory exhibits a self-duality under field redefinition that\nresembles T-duality.

Microlensing variability is caused by\nthe motions of the observer, the lens galaxy (including the motion of the stars\nwithin the galaxy), and the source; hence, its frequency is directly related to\nthe galaxy's transverse peculiar velocity. The idea is to count time-event\nrates (e.g., peak or caustic crossing rates) in the observed microlensing light\ncurves of lensed quasars that can be compared with model predictions for\ndifferent values of the transverse peculiar velocity. To compensate for the\nlarge time-scale of microlensing variability we propose to count and model the\nnumber of events in an ensemble of gravitational lenses.

Purpose: A new direct study of low energy\n$^{22}$Ne(p,$\\gamma$)$^{23}$Na resonances has been performed at the Laboratory\nfor Underground Nuclear Astrophysics (LUNA), in the Gran Sasso National\nLaboratory, Italy.

Including effects of broken\nlocal spatial inversion symmetry by a trap potential within the framework of\nthe real-space Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory at $T=0$, we point out that an\nodd-parity $p$-wave Cooper-pair amplitude is expected to have already been\nrealized in previous experiments on an (even-parity) $s$-wave superfluid Fermi\ngas with spin imbalance. This indicates that, when one suddenly changes the\n$s$-wave pairing interaction to an appropriate $p$-wave one by using a Feshbach\ntechnique in this case, a non-vanishing $p$-wave superfluid order parameter is\nimmediately obtained, which is given by the product of the $p$-wave interaction\nand the $p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been induced in the\nspin-imbalanced $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas. Thus, by definition, the system\nis in the $p$-wave superfluid state, at least just after this manipulation.\nSince the achievement of a $p$-wave superfluid state is one of the most\nexciting challenges in cold Fermi gas physics, our results may provide an\nalternative approach to this unconventional pairing state.

Pioneer radial velocity follow-up observations with the UVES\nspectrograph at the ESO - VLT of this system clearly ruled out the large radial\nvelocity variation, leaving a discrepancy between the observation and the\nprediction. In this paper, we further characterise the microlensing system by\nanalysing its spectral energy distribution (SED) derived using the UVES\nspectrum and new observations with the ARCoIRIS (CTIO) near-infrared\nspectrograph and the Keck adaptive optics instrument NIRC2 in the J, H, and Ks\nbands.

Learning representations of words is a pioneering study\nin this school of research. However, paragraph (or sentence and document)\nembedding learning is more suitable/reasonable for some tasks, such as\nsentiment classification and document summarization. Nevertheless, as far as we\nare aware, there is relatively less work focusing on the development of\nunsupervised paragraph embedding methods. Classic paragraph embedding methods\ninfer the representation of a given paragraph by considering all of the words\noccurring in the paragraph. Consequently, those stop or function words that\noccur frequently may mislead the embedding learning process to produce a misty\nparagraph representation. Motivated by these observations, our major\ncontributions in this paper are twofold. First, we propose a novel unsupervised\nparagraph embedding method, named the essence vector (EV) model, which aims at\nnot only distilling the most representative information from a paragraph but\nalso excluding the general background information to produce a more informative\nlow-dimensional vector representation for the paragraph. Second, in view of the\nincreasing importance of spoken content processing, an extension of the EV\nmodel, named the denoising essence vector (D-EV) model, is proposed.

Solving such a\nminimization is a hard combinatorial problem that requires pre-computation and\nstoring of all pairwise geodesic distances for the matched surfaces. A popular\nway for compact representation of functions on surfaces is by projecting them\ninto the leading eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO).

From observational data alone, a Bayesian network can\nonly be identified up to Markov equivalence and interventional experiments are\nrequired to distinguish between Markov equivalent Bayesian networks. It is\ntherefore important to describe and understand the set of Markov equivalence\nclasses (MECs) and their sizes. In this paper, we initiate the combinatorial\nenumeration of MECs on a fixed undirected graph, and thereby recast this\nimportant statistical problem into the language of combinatorial optimization.\nCombinatorially, two Bayesian networks are Markov equivalent if their\nunderlying undirected graphs and their set of immoralities are the same. We\nshow that the NP-complete Minimum Vertex Cover problem reduces to the\ncomputation of a Bayesian network with the maximum number of immoralities. The\nNP-hardness of this problem shows the complexity of enumerating MECs from the\nperspective of combinatorial optimization. We then solve this enumeration\nproblem for classically studied families of graphs including paths, cycles, and\nsome types of complete bipartite graphs, trees, and circulants. We also provide\ntight bounds on the number and size of MECs on a given tree. These bounds\nexactly parallel the well-known bounds for the independent set problem.\nFinally, a computer program was written to analyze the enumeration problem on\nall graphs with at most 10 nodes and all triangle-free graphs with at most $12$\nnodes. The results show a trade-off between degree and clustering coefficient\nwith respect to the number of MECs and their sizes. In addition, this program\nestablished that the frequency vector consisting of the number of MECs of each\nsize uniquely determines the undirected graph.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 28 Figures"]}]
