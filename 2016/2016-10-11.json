Methods: Recently, a fast and accurate Graphics\nProcessor Unit (GPU)-based MC simulation of proton transport was developed and\nused as the dose calculation engine in a GPU-accelerated IMPT optimizer.\nBesides dose, the dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETd) can be\nsimultaneously scored, which makes biological dose (BD) optimization possible.\nTo convert from LETd to BD, a linear relation was assumed. Using this novel\noptimizer, inverse biological planning was applied to 4 patients: 2 small and 1\nlarge thyroid tumor targets, and 1 glioma case. To create these plans,\nconstraints were placed to maintain the physical dose (PD) within 1.25 times\nthe prescription while maximizing target BD. For comparison, conventional IMRT\nand IMPT plans were created for each case in Eclipse (Varian, Inc). The same\ncritical structure PD constraints were used for the IMRT, IMPT and\nbio-optimized plans. The BD for the IMPT plans were obtained through MC\nre-calculations. Results: Compared to standard IMPT, the bio-optimal plans for\npatients with small tumor targets displayed a BD escalation that was around\ntwice the PD increase. Dose sparing to critical structures was improved\ncompared to both IMRT and IMPT. No significant BD increase could be achieved\nfor the large thyroid case, and when the presence of critical structures\nmitigated the contribution of additional fields. The calculation of the\nbio-optimized plans can be completed in a clinically viable time (<30 minutes)\non a 24-GPU system. Conclusion: By exploiting GPU acceleration, MC-based,\nbiologically optimized plans were created for small-target tumor patients.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues\nhave hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both\naccuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's\nNeural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these\nissues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and\nuses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that\nis most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14\nEnglish-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive\nresults to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of\nisolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60%\ncompared to Google's phrase-based production system.\n"]}]

Using a combination of\nN-body simulations and a semi-analytical model, we investigate the variance in\nsubhalo mass fractions and subhalo occupation numbers, with an emphasis on how\nthese statistics scale with halo formation time. We demonstrate that the\nsubhalo mass fraction, f_sub, is mainly a function of halo formation time, with\nearlier forming haloes having less substructure. At fixed formation redshift,\nthe average f_sub is virtually independent of halo mass, and the mass\ndependence of f_sub is therefore mainly a manifestation of more massive haloes\nassembling later. We compare observational constraints on f_sub from\ngravitational lensing to our model predictions and simulation results. Although\nthe inferred f_sub are substantially higher than the median LCDM predictions,\nthey fall within the 95th percentile due to halo-to-halo variance. We show that\nwhile the halo occupation distribution of subhaloes, P(N|M), is\nsuper-Poissonian for large <N>, a well established result, it becomes\nsub-Poissonian for <N> < 2. Ignoring the non-Poissonity results in systematic\nerrors of the clustering of galaxies of a few percent, and with a complicated\nscale- and luminosity-dependence. Earlier-formed haloes have P(N|M) closer to a\nPoisson distribution, suggesting that the dynamical evolution of subhaloes\ndrives the statistics towards Poissonian. Contrary to a recent claim, the\nnon-Poissonity of subhalo occupation statistics does not vanish by selecting\nhaloes with fixed mass and fixed formation redshift. Finally, we use subhalo\noccupation statistics to put loose constraints on the mass and formation\nredshift of the Milky Way halo.

Given observations showing that individual\nnovae produce both carbonaceous and silicate grains, we concur with previous\nworks attributing this bimodality to chemical heterogeneity of the ejecta. Nova\noutflows are diverse and inhomogeneous, and the observed variety of dust\nformation events can be reconciled by different abundances, the range of shock\nproperties, and the observer viewing angle. The latter may govern the magnitude\nof extinction, with the deepest extinction events occurring for observers\nwithin the binary equatorial plane.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, 1 table; Submitted to MNRAS"]}]

The Core allows users to define how nodes\nare connected, and rules that determine when and how nodes respond to their\ninputs. The Mapping Layer allows users to map node output values to MIDI data\nthat is routed to software instruments in a digital audio workstation. By\nshifting between bottom-up and top-down NW shifts between analytic and\nassociative processing modes.\n","Comment: 8 pages, In Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Musical\n  Meta-creation.

According to honing theory, minds, like other selforganizing\nsystems, modify their contents and adapt to their environments to minimize\nentropy. Creativity begins with detection of high psychological entropy\nmaterial, which provokes uncertainty and is arousalinducing. The creative\nprocess involves recursively considering this material from new contexts until\nit is sufficiently restructured that arousal dissipates. Restructuring involves\nneural synchrony and dynamic binding, and may be facilitated by temporarily\nshifting to a more associative mode of thought. A creative work may similarly\ninduce restructuring in others, and thereby contribute to the cultural\nevolution of more nuanced worldviews.

Honing theory addresses challenges not\naddressed by other theories of creativity, such as the factors that guide\nrestructuring, and in what sense creative works evolve.

In\nthis paper, we propose a new representation of a gene's transcription activity\nthat explicitly captures the pattern of spatial co-expression across different\nanatomical brain regions. For each gene, we define a Spatial Expression Network\n(SEN), a network quantifying co-expression patterns amongst several anatomical\nlocations. Network similarity measures are then employed to quantify the\ntopological resemblance between pairs of SENs and identify naturally occurring\nclusters. Using network-theoretical measures, three large clusters have been\ndetected featuring distinct topological properties. We then evaluate whether\ntopological diversity of the SENs reflects significant differences in\nbiological function through a gene ontology analysis. We report on evidence\nsuggesting that one of the three SEN clusters consists of genes specifically\ninvolved in the nervous system, including genes related to brain disorders,\nwhile the remaining two clusters are representative of immunity, transcription\nand translation.

In this work,\ninspired by the success of convex programming in provably and stably solving\nvarious quadratic constrained problems, we develop a semidefinite\nprogramming-based algorithm and provide theoretical guarantees. In particular,\nwe show that almost all signals can be uniquely recovered by this algorithm (up\nto a global phase).

The oscillation is characterized by\nalternate oscillations of a forebody leeward vortex pair up and down and\nin-phase swings from side to side.

Another\nheuristic, based on log entropy, yields a more moderate speedup, but enables\nthe discovery of higher quality LPMs. The third heuristic, based on the\nrelative information gain, shows unstable performance: for some data sets the\nspeedup and LPM quality are higher than with the log entropy based method,\nwhile for other data sets there is no speedup at all.\n","Comment: paper accepted and to appear in the proceedings of the IEEE Symposium\n  on Computational Intelligence and Data Mining (CIDM), special session on\n  Process Mining, part of the Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence\n  (SSCI)"]}]

We found that severe air pollution crises occurred when the 850 and 500\nhpa geopotential heights and their relative temperatures present maximum values\nabove the city. The most relevant synoptic parameter was the 850 hPa\ngeopotential height, which is located about 1500 m of altitude. We compared\nlocal meteorological conditions (specifically wind stress, rain amount and\nthermal inversion) against the urban air pollution levels from 2009 to 2013. We\nfound several empirical criteria for forecasting high daily PM10 air pollution\nlevels in Naples. Pollution crises occurred when (a) the wind stress was\nbetween 1 and 2 m/s, (b) the thermal inversion between two strategic locations\nwas at least 3{\\deg}C/200m and (c) it did not significantly rain for at least 7\ndays. Beside these meteorological conditions, severe pollution crises occurred\nalso during festivals when fireworks and bonfires are lighted, and during\nanomalous breeze conditions and severe fire accidents. Finally, we propose a\nbasic model to predict PM10 concentration levels from local meteorological\nconditions that can be easily forecast a few days in advance. The synthetic\nPM10 record predicted by the model was found to correlate with the PM10\nobservations with a correlation coefficient close to 0.80 with a confidence\ngreater than 99%.
