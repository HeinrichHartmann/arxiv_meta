The basic\nconcepts of the corresponding theory were introduced by Markov in 1907 on\ncoding literary texts. Since then, the Markov Chain theory was developerd by a\nnumber of leading mathematicians, such as Kolmogorov, Feller etc. However, only\nfrom the 1960's the importance of this theory to the Natural, Social and most\nof the other Applied Sciences has been recognized. In this review paper we\npresent applications of finite Markov Chains to management problems, which can\nbe solved, as most of the problems concerning applications of Markov chains in\ngeneral do, by distinguishing between two types of Chains, the Ergodic and the\nAbsorbing ones.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure, 18 references"]}]
