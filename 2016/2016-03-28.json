In particular, we\nexamine the participant eccentricity, which quantifies the eccentricity of the\ninitial source shape by the major axes of the ellipse formed by the interaction\npoints of the participating nucleons. We show that reasonable variation of the\ndensity parameters in the Glauber calculation, as well as variations in how\nmatter production is modeled, do not significantly modify the already\nestablished behavior of the participant eccentricity as a function of collision\ncentrality. Focusing on event-by-event fluctuations and correlations of the\ndistributions of participating nucleons we demonstrate that, depending on the\nachieved event-plane resolution, fluctuations in the elliptic flow magnitude\n$v_2$ lead to most measurements being sensitive to the root-mean-square, rather\nthan the mean of the $v_2$ distribution. Neglecting correlations among\nparticipants, we derive analytical expressions for the participant eccentricity\ncumulants as a function of the number of participating nucleons,\n$\\Npart$,keeping non-negligible contributions up to $\\ordof{1/\\Npart^3}$. We\nfind that the derived expressions yield the same results as obtained from\nmixed-event MCG calculations which remove the correlations stemming from the\nnuclear collision process. Most importantly, we conclude from the comparison\nwith MCG calculations that the fourth order participant eccentricity cumulant\ndoes not approach the spatial anisotropy obtained assuming a smooth nuclear\nmatter distribution. In particular, for the Cu+Cu system, these quantities\ndeviate from each other by almost a factor of two over a wide range in\ncentrality.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 10 figures, submitted to PRC"]}]

Related conjectures suggest a promising\nfuture for using Kazhdan-Lusztig theory to relate quantum and algebraic group\ncohomology and Ext groups in these same small prime and possibly singular\nweight settings. A part of one of these conjectures is proved in Part II of\nthis paper.

The proposed framework\nattempts to significantly expedite the process by using a series of manually\nlabeled microscopic images for training followed by automated high-throughput\negg detection. The problem is particularly difficult due to the presence of a\nlarge population of non-egg particles (disturbances) in the image frames that\nare very similar to SCN eggs in shape, pose and illumination. Therefore, the\nselective autoencoder is trained to learn unique features related to the\ninvariant shapes and sizes of the SCN eggs without handcrafting.

In this\npaper, we gain novel insights into the application of quantum annealing (QA) to\nmachine learning (ML) through experiments in natural language processing (NLP),\nseizure prediction, and linear separability testing. These experiments are\nperformed on QA simulators and early-stage commercial QA hardware and compared\nto an unprecedented number of traditional ML techniques. We extend QBoost, an\nearly implementation of a binary classifier that utilizes a quantum annealer,\nvia resampling and ensembling of predicted probabilities to produce a more\nrobust class estimator. To determine the strengths and weaknesses of this\napproach, resampled QBoost (RQBoost) is tested across several datasets and\ncompared to QBoost and traditional ML. We show and explain how QBoost in\ncombination with a commercial QA device are unable to perfectly separate binary\nclass data which is linearly separable via logistic regression with shrinkage.\nWe further explore the performance of RQBoost in the space of NLP and seizure\nprediction and find QA-enabled ML using QBoost and RQBoost is outperformed by\ntraditional techniques. Additionally, we provide a detailed discussion of\nalgorithmic constraints and trade-offs imposed by the use of this QA hardware.\nThrough these experiments, we provide unique insights into the state of quantum\nML via boosting and the use of quantum annealing hardware that are valuable to\ninstitutions interested in applying QA to problems in ML and beyond.\n"]}]
