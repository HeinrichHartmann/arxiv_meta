However, to\nthe authors' best knowledge this is the first theorem showing a collapse of the\nparity index that exploits the fact that a given automaton is unambiguous.\n"]}]

A relatively high percentage of nodes, in neuronal networks,\nform a higher core in their structure.

We\nintroduce the method of a linear search grid to analyse GRB events with large\nsky localisation uncertainties such as the localisations provided by the Fermi\nGamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs)\ncan be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not\nwell-localised, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival\ntime between detectors. Using a linear search grid we are able to reduce the\ncomputational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky\nlocalisation of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is\nobserved in coincidence. We use the linear search grid method in a search for\nGWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments\nbetween 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analysed\nfor GW counterparts. A fraction of our GRB events are analysed using data from\nGEO600 while the detector was using squeezed-light states to improve its\nsensitivity; this is the first search for GWs using data from a squeezed-light\ninterferometric observatory. We find no evidence for GW signals, either with\nany individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each\nGRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, assuming a fixed\nGW emission energy of $10^{-2} M_{\\odot}c^{2}$, with a median exclusion\ndistance of 0.8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0.3 Mpc at 1 kHz.

The\nanticipated advantages of such a device are around 25% less drag, for a\ncapability which ranges between equivalent and greater than twofold that of a\nconventional tail. The tail of a popular, radio-controlled, model aircraft is\nreplaced with a rotatable stabiliser and its rotation is effected by way of a\ncontinuously-rotating servo, modified with a potentiometer. Two hollow,\ncarbon-fibre shafts (one sleeved within the other so as to allow free rotation)\nserve as the mechanical link between the servo and the tail. Inserting wiring\nalong the full length of the innermost shaft and incorporating three slip rings\ninto its collar, at the forward, servo end, facilitated an electrical supply to\nthe tail. A mapping betweeen the position of the controls and states of the\nstabiliser is formulated. Small and continuous adjustments cause the stabiliser\nto rotate in the opposite direction to the controls (when viewed from aft) and\nthe deflection of the hinged control surface is proportional to the radial\ndisplacement of the controls from their centred position. For what would amount\nto large and contradictory rotations of the device in terms of this protocol\n(rotations greater than 90$^\\circ$), the desired configuration can be more\nefficiently achieved by regarding the device's original orientation to differ\nby 180$^\\circ$ from what it actually is and by reversing the sign of the\ndeflection.

We find that the rotational\ndamping by infrared emission can significantly decrease the degree of alignment\nof small particles from the saturation level, whereas the excitation by ion\ncollisions can enhance the alignment of ultrasmall particles. Using the\ncomputed degrees of alignment, we predict the polarization level of MDE from\nfree-flying magnetic nanoparticles to be rather low. Such a polarization level\nis within the upper limits measured for anomalous microwave emission (AME),\nwhich indicates that MDE from free-flying iron particles may not be ruled out\nas a source of AME. We also quantify spinning dust emission from free-flying\niron nanoparticles with permanent magnetic moments and find that its emissivity\nis one order of magnitude lower than that from spinning polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs). Finally, we compute the polarization spectra of spinning\ndust emission from PAHs for the different interstellar magnetic fields.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

One possible reason is that there\nmight be more uncited articles than would be predicted by any model if some\narticles are inherently uncitable. Using data from 23 different Scopus\ncategories, this article tests the assumption that removing a proportion of\nuncited articles from a citation dataset allows statistical distributions to\nhave much closer fits.

Apparently uncitable articles seem to occur due to the presence of\nacademic-related magazines in Scopus categories.

We\ninvestigate existence of optimum strategies for coupling expression to the cell\ncycle that minimize the stochastic component. Intriguingly, results show that a\nzero production rate throughout the cell cycle, with expression only occurring\njust before cell division minimizes noise from bursty expression for a fixed\nmean protein level. In contrast, the optimal strategy in the case of\npartitioning errors is to make the protein just after cell division.

Furthermore, by using the Corbino geometry we ensure\nthat we measure the properties of the bulk rather than spurious edge effects.\nWe ob- serve activated behaviour of the specific heat, and infer quasiparticle\neffective masses of 1.3m_e and 2.2m_e for {\\nu} = 5/2 and 7/3, respectively. We\nalso see evidence for a peak in the specific heat at around 100 mK. Finally,\nextending the technique to lower temperatures could lead to detection of the\nnon-Abelian entropy predicted to occur in the bulk quasiparticles at 5/2\nhalf-filling.\n"]}]

Model A can be informally described\nas follows: 1) The information is stored in an $ n $-cell register, where each\ncell can either be left empty, or can contain a particle of one of $ P $\npossible types, and 2) due to the imperfections of the device every particle is\nshifted $ k $ cells away from its original position over time, where $ k $ is\ndrawn from a certain range of integers, without the possibility of reordering\nparticles.

Several\nvariations of the above models are also discussed, e.g., with multiple\nparticles per cell, with additional types of noise, and the continuous-time\ncase.

In addition the spline basis\nfunctions arise from solving functional optimization problems involving\nderivative based penalties, so moving to discrete penalties for smoothing may\nnot always be desirable. The purpose of this note is to point out that the\nthree properties of basis-penalty sparsity, mix-and-match penalization and ease\nof setup are readily obtainable with B-splines subject to derivative based\npenalization. The penalty setup typically requires a few lines of code, rather\nthan the two lines typically required for P-splines, but this one off\ndisadvantage seems to be the only one associated with using derivative based\npenalties. As an example application, it is shown how basis-penalty sparsity\nenables efficient computation with tensor product smoothers of scattered data.\n"]}]

We\nexamine the effects of surface heterogeneity in a few scenarios in a model\nsystem, 3D lattice Ising model. Utilizing umbrella sampling computer\nsimulations we find the nucleation barrier can be significantly lowered in\npresence of surface heterogeneity, even if the average surface energy is kept\nconstant.\n"]}]
