It is supposed to complement all studies performed on classical\npoint-particle equivalents of SME fermions. The classical analogue of a photon\nis not a massive particle being described by a usual equation of motion, but a\ngeometric ray underlying the eikonal equation. The first part of the paper will\nset up the necessary tools to understand this correspondence for interesting\ncases of the minimal SME photon sector. In conventional optics the eikonal\nequation follows from an action principle, which is demonstrated to work in\nmost (but not all) Lorentz-violating cases as well. The integrands of the\naction functional correspond to Finsler structures, which establishes the\nconnection to Finsler geometry. The second part of the article treats\nLorentz-violating light rays in a weak gravitational background by implementing\nthe principle of minimal coupling. Thereby it is shown how Lorentz violation in\nthe photon sector can be constrained by measurements of light bending at\nmassive bodies such as the Sun. The phenomenological studies are based on the\ncurrently running ESA mission GAIA and the planned NASA/ESA mission LATOR.

Our method is to compare the 14-C variation around AD\n775 with other periods of strong variability. Our results are: (a) We see three\nperiods, where 14-C varied over 200 yr in a special way showing a certain\npattern of strong secular variation: after a Grand Minimum with strongly\nincreasing 14-C, there is a series of strong short-term drop(s), rise(s), and\nagain drop(s) within 60 yr, ending up to 200 yr after the start of the Grand\nMinimum. These three periods include the strong rises around BC 671, AD 775,\nand AD 1795. (b) We show with several solar activity proxies (radioisotopes,\nsunspots, and aurorae) for the AD 770s and 1790s that such intense rapid 14-C\nincreases can be explained by strong rapid decreases in solar activity and,\nhence, wind, so that the decrease in solar modulation potential leads to an\nincrease in radioisotope production. (c) The strong rises around AD 775 and\n1795 are due to three effects, (i) very strong activity in the previous cycles\n(i.e. very low 14-C level), (ii) the declining phase of a very strong Schwabe\ncycle, and (iii) a phase of very weak activity after the strong 14-C rise --\nvery short and/or weak cycle(s) like the suddenly starting Dalton minimum.

The point defects are placed randomly and uniformly on\nthe substrate before deposition of the rods. The general case of unequal\nprobabilities for orientation of depositing of rods along different directions\nof the lattice is analyzed. Two different models of deposition are used. In the\nrelaxation random sequential adsorption model (RRSA), the deposition of rods is\ndistributed over different sites on the substrate. In the single cluster\nrelaxation model (RSC), the single cluster grows by the random accumulation of\nrods on the boundary of the cluster. For both models, a suppression of growth\nof the infinite cluster at some critical concentration of defects $d_c$ is\nobserved. In the zero defect lattices, the jamming concentration $p_j$ (RRSA)\nand the density of single clusters $p_s$ (RSC) decrease with increasing length\nrods and with a decrease in the order parameter. For the RRSA model, the value\nof $d_c$ decreases for short rods as the value of $s$ increases. For longer\nrods, the value of $d_c$ is almost independent of $s$. Moreover, for short\nrods, the percolation threshold is almost insensitive to the defect\nconcentration for all values of $s$. For the RSC model, the growth of clusters\nwith ellipse-like shapes is observed for non-zero values of $s$. The density of\nthe clusters $p_s$ at the critical concentration of defects $d_c$ depends in a\ncomplex manner on the values of $s$ and $k$. For disordered systems, the value\nof $p_s$ tends towards zero in the limits of the very long rods and very small\ncritical concentrations $d_c \\to 0$. In this case, the introduction of defects\nresults in a suppression of rods stacking and in the formation of `empty' or\nloose clusters with very low density. On the other hand, denser clusters are\nformed for ordered systems.\n","Comment: 14 figures, 1 table, 28 refs"]}]

Such an expression is valid only if a smooth and\nperiodic gauge has been chosen in the entire Brillouin zone, and even then,\nconvergence with respect to the $\\mathbf{k}$-space mesh density can be\ndifficult to obtain. In order to solve this problem, we propose to relax the\nperiodicity condition in one direction (say, the $k_z$ direction) so that a\ngauge discontinuity is introduced on a 2D $\\mathbf{k}$ plane normal to $k_z$.\nThe total $\\theta$ response then has contributions from both the integral of\nthe Chern-Simons 3-form over the 3D bulk BZ and the gauge discontinuity\nexpressed as a 2D integral over the $\\mathbf{k}$ plane.

The total $\\theta$ thus consists of three\nterms which can be expressed as integrals over 3D, 2D and 1D manifolds. When\ntime-reversal symmetry is present and the gauge in the bulk BZ is chosen to\nrespect this symmetry, both the 3D and 2D integrals vanish; the entire\ncontribution then comes from the vortex-loop integral, which is either 0 or\n$\\pi$ corresponding to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of 3D time-reversal\ninvariant insulators.

For our IDL software package tellrem we used a recent\napproach to model telluric absorption features with the line-by-line radiative\ntransfer model (LBLRTM). The broad wavelength coverage of the X-Shooter at VLT\nallows us to expand their technique by determining the abundances of the most\nimportant telluric molecules H2O, O2, CO2, and CH4 from sufficiently isolated\nline groups. For individual observations we construct a telluric absorption\nmodel for most of the spectral range that is used to remove the telluric\nabsorption from the object spectrum. We remove telluric absorption from both\ncontinuum regions and emission lines without systematic residuals for most of\nthe processable spectral range; however, our method increases the statistical\nerrors. The errors of the corrected spectrum typically increase by 10% for\nS/N~10 and by a factor of two for high-quality data (S/N~100), i.e. the method\nis accurate on the percent level. Modelling telluric absorption can be an\nalternative to the observation of standard stars for removing telluric\ncontamination.\n","Comment: accepted by A&A, 10 pages, 6 figures, added note in proof and\n  corrected typo in title"]}]

Most of this inability to\nachieve high throughput is explained by the fundamental constraints involved in\nguaranteeing ACID --- the addition of cores results in more concurrent\ntransactions accessing the same contended data for which access must be\nserialized in order to guarantee isolation. Thus, linear scalability for\ncontended workloads is impossible. However, there exist flaws in many modern\narchitectures that exacerbate their poor scalability, and result in throughput\nthat is much worse than fundamentally required by the workload.\n  In this paper we identify two prevalent design principles that limit the\nmulti-core scalability of many (but not all) transactional database systems on\ncontended workloads: the multi-purpose nature of execution threads in these\nsystems, and the lack of advanced planning of data access. We demonstrate the\ndeleterious results of these design principles by implementing a prototype\nsystem, ORTHRUS, that is motivated by the principles of separation of database\ncomponent functionality and advanced planning of transactions.

Recent optimization models of SFCs assume that the\nfunctionality of a middlebox is provided by a single software appliance,\ncommonly known as Virtual Network Function (VNF). This assumption limits SFCs\nto the throughput of an individual VNF and resources of a physical machine\nhosting the VNF instance.

In contrast with many existing works on energy-efficient power control,\nwhich ignore the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter, we consider a\nnew generalized cross-layer EE metric. This approach is relevant when the\ntransmitters have a non-zero energy cost even when the radiated power is zero\nand takes into account the presence of a finite packet buffer and packet\narrival at the transmitter. As the Nash equilibrium (NE) is an\nenergy-inefficient solution, the present work aims at overcoming this deficit\nby improving the global energy-efficiency. Indeed, as the considered system has\nmultiple agencies each with their own interest, the performance metric\nreflecting the individual interest of each decision maker is the global\nenergy-efficiency defined then as the sum over individual energy-efficiencies.\nRepeated games (RG) are investigated through the study of two dynamic games\n(finite RG and discounted RG), whose equilibrium is defined when introducing a\nnew operating point (OP), Pareto-dominating the NE and relying only on\nindividual channel state information (CSI). Accordingly, closed-form\nexpressions of the minimum number of stages of the game for finite RG (FRG) and\nthe maximum discount factor of the discounted RG (DRG) were established. The\ncross-layer model in the RG formulation leads to achieving a shorter minimum\nnumber of stages in the FRG even for higher number of users.

The\ninexorably growing dependency on computational information processing for\nweapons, intelligence, communication, and logistics systems continues to\nincrease the vulnerability of missions to various cyber threats. Attacks on\nCISs or other cyber incidents degrade or disrupt the usage of CISs, and the\nresulting mission capability, performance, and completion. These incidents are\nexpected to increase in frequency and sophistication. The workshop participants\nconcluded that the key to solving the mission impact assessment problem was in\nadopting and developing a new model-driven paradigm that creates and validates\nmechanisms of modeling the mission organization, the mission(s), and the\ncyber-vulnerable systems that support the mission(s). Such models then simulate\nor portray the impacts of the cyber-attacks. In addition, such model-based\nanalysis could explore multiple alternative mitigation and work-around\nstrategies - an essential part of coping with mission impact - and select the\noptimal course of mitigating actions. Only such a paradigm can be expected to\nprovide meaningful, actionable information about mission impacts that have not\nbeen seen before or do not match prior experiences and patterns.

By explicitly accounting for\nfeature-sharing across trees together with accuracy/cost trade-off, our method\nis able to significantly reduce feature cost by pruning subtrees that introduce\nmore loss in terms of feature cost than benefit in terms of prediction accuracy\ngain. Theoretically, we prove that a linear programming relaxation produces the\nexact solution of the original integer program. This allows us to use efficient\nconvex optimization tools to obtain an optimally pruned ensemble for any given\nbudget. Empirically, we see that our pruning algorithm significantly improves\nthe performance of the state of the art ensemble method BudgetRF.\n"]}]

Methods: We have developed HopkinsPD, a novel smartphone-based\nmonitoring platform, which measures symptoms actively (i.e. data are collected\nwhen a suite of tests is initiated by the individual at specific times during\nthe day), and passively (i.e. data are collected continuously in the\nbackground). After data collection, we extract features to assess measures of\nfive key behaviors related to PD symptoms -- voice, balance, gait, dexterity,\nand reaction time. A random forest classifier is used to discriminate\nmeasurements taken after a dose of medication (treatment) versus before the\nmedication dose (baseline). Results: A worldwide study for remote PD monitoring\nwas established using HopkinsPD in July, 2014. This study used entirely remote,\nonline recruitment and installation, demonstrating highly cost-effective\nscalability. In six months, 226 individuals (121 PD and 105 controls)\ncontributed over 46,000 hours of passive monitoring data and approximately\n8,000 instances of structured tests of voice, balance, gait, reaction, and\ndexterity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have\ncollected data at such a scale for remote PD monitoring. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the initial ability to discriminate treatment from baseline with\n71.0(+-0.4)% accuracy, which suggests medication response can be monitored\nremotely via smartphone-based measures.\n"]}]
