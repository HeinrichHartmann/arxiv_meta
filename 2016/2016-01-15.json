Double-mask\netching techniques pose a clear limitation in the maximum size of GEM foils. In\ncontrast, single-mask techniques developed at CERN would allow one to overcome\nthose limitations. However with interest in GEM foils increasing and CERN being\nthe only main distributor, keeping up with the demand for GEM foils will be\ndifficult. Thus the commercialization of GEMs has been established by Tech-Etch\nof Plymouth, MA, USA using single-mask techniques.\n  We report on the electrical and geometrical properties, along with the inner\nand outer hole diameter size uniformity of 10 $\\times$ 10 cm$^2$ and\n40$\\times$40 cm$^2$ GEM foils. The Tech-Etch foils were found to have excellent\nelectrical properties. The measured mean optical properties were found to\nreflect the desired parameters and are consistent with those measured in\ndouble-mask GEM foils, and show good hole diameter uniformity over the active\narea. These foils are well suited for future applications in nuclear and\nparticle physics where tracking devices are needed.\n","Comment: Submitted to NIM A"]}]

The\nMHDP enables a robot to form object categories using multimodal information,\ne.g., visual, auditory, and haptic information, which can be observed by\nperforming actions on an object. However, performing many actions on a target\nobject requires a long time. In a real-time scenario, i.e., when the time is\nlimited, the robot has to determine the set of actions that is most effective\nfor recognizing a target object. We propose an MHDP-based active perception\nmethod that uses the information gain (IG) maximization criterion and lazy\ngreedy algorithm. We show that the IG maximization criterion is optimal in the\nsense that the criterion is equivalent to a minimization of the expected\nKullback--Leibler divergence between a final recognition state and the\nrecognition state after the next set of actions. However, a straightforward\ncalculation of IG is practically impossible. Therefore, we derive an efficient\nMonte Carlo approximation method for IG by making use of a property of the\nMHDP. We also show that the IG has submodular and non-decreasing properties as\na set function because of the structure of the graphical model of the MHDP.\nTherefore, the IG maximization problem is reduced to a submodular maximization\nproblem. This means that greedy and lazy greedy algorithms are effective and\nhave a theoretical justification for their performance.

In non-Hermitian lattices with a complex (i.e. not real) energy band,\nextension of the semiclassical model is not intuitive. Here we show that the\nacceleration theorem holds for non-Hermitian lattices with a complex energy\nband only {\\it on average}, and that the periodic wave packet motion of the\nparticle in the real space is described by a trajectory in {\\it complex} plane,\ni.e. it generally corresponds to reshaping and breathing of the wave packet in\naddition to a transverse oscillatory motion. The concept of BOs involving\ncomplex trajectories is exemplified by considering two examples of\nnon-Hermitian lattices with a complex band dispersion relation, including the\nHatano-Nelson tight-binding Hamiltonian describing the hopping motion of a\nquantum particle on a linear lattice with an imaginary vector potential and a\ntight-binding lattice with imaginary hopping rates.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Phys.

The phenomenon occurs due to coupling between\nnormal and rotational degrees-of-freedom such that the effective normal force\nbecomes attractive rather than repulsive. Despite a rich literature, the\nforward evolution problem remains unsolved other than in certain restricted\ncases in 2D with single contact points. Various practical consequences of the\ntheory are revisited, including models for robotic manipulators, and the\nstrange behaviour of chalk when pushed rather than dragged across a blackboard.\n  Reviewing recent theory, a general formulation is proposed, including a\nPoisson or energetic impact law. The general problem in 2D with a single point\nof contact is discussed and cases or inconsistency or indeterminacy enumerated.\nStrategies to resolve the paradox via contact regularisation are discussed from\na dynamical systems point of view. By passing to the infinite stiffness limit\nand allowing impact without collision, inconsistent and indeterminate cases are\nshown to be resolvable for all open sets of conditions. However, two\nunavoidable ambiguities that can be reached in finite time are discussed in\ndetail, so called dynamic jam and reverse chatter.

A side benefit is that we do\nnot use Skolem function (which do not matter for proving compactness of logics\nbut still are of interest). Let lambda be 2^mu if regular and its successor\notherwise. Model theoretically we investigate notions of bigness of types,\nusually those are ideals of the set of formulas in a model, definable in\nappropriate sense. We build a model of cardinality lambda^plus by a sequence of\nmodels M_alpha of cardinality lambda for alpha less than lambda^plus, each\nM_alpha equips with a sequence (M_alpha, i, a_alpha, i, Omega_alpha, i) : i in\nS_I subseteq lambda, with M_alpha, i is of cardinality less than lambda,\nprecedes-increasing continuous with i, Omega_alpha, i a bigness notion defined\nusing parameters from M_alpha, i and a_alpha, i realized in M_alpha, i plus 1\nover M_alpha,i a Omega_alpha, i-big type. As alpha increase, not only M_alpha\nincrease, but this extra structure increasing modulo a club of lambda, this is\nwhy we have insisted on lambda being regular. This can be considered as a way\nto omit types of cardinality lambda, which in general is hard. The fact that\nlambda is not too much larger than mu helps us to guarantee that any possible\nautomorphism of structures be defined in M equals union bracket M_alpha: alpha\nless than lambda^plus bracket by approximations of cardinal mu and so we can\nenumerate them all.\n"]}]

We show that in comparison to Pt coated tips, diamond coated tips exhibit\nimproved signal stability, lower background signal and less imaging artifacts\nrelated to PFM which is reflected in the spread of measurements. This is\nattributed to the improved mechanical stability of the conductive layer. The\naverage deviation of the mean PFM signal is 38.3%, for a diamond coated tip.\nAlthough this deviation is relatively high, it is far better than values from\nliterature which showed a deviation of approx. 73.1%. Additionally, we find\nthat the average deviation of the background signal from 0 is 11.6% of the PPLN\ndomain contrast. Thus, the background signal needs to be taken into account\nwhen quantifying PFM signals and should be subtracted from PFM signals.
