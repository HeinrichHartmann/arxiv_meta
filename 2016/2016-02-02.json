In spite of their existence, little is known on how to\nconstruct such encoders in practice. This paper is devoted to their\nconstruction. In particular, two families of linear encoders are presented and\nproved to have good joint spectra. The first family is derived from Gabidulin\ncodes, a class of maximum-rank-distance codes. The second family is constructed\nusing a serial concatenation of an encoder of a low-density parity-check code\n(as outer encoder) with a low-density generator matrix encoder (as inner\nencoder). In addition, criteria for good linear encoders are defined for three\ncoding applications: lossless source coding, channel coding, and lossless JSCC.\nIn the framework of the code-spectrum approach, these three scenarios\ncorrespond to the problems of constructing linear encoders with good kernel\nspectra, good image spectra, and good joint spectra, respectively. Good joint\nspectra imply both good kernel spectra and good image spectra, and for every\nlinear encoder having a good kernel (resp., image) spectrum, it is proved that\nthere exists a linear encoder not only with the same kernel (resp., image) but\nalso with a good joint spectrum.

The ion-sphere models of\nSalpeter and others evolved into useful average-atom models for finite-$T$\nCoulomb systems, as in Lieberman's Inferno code. We replaced these by\ncorrelation-sphere models that exploit the description of matter via density\nfunctionals linked to pair-distributions. These methods provided practical\ncomputational means for studying strongly interacting electron-ion Coulomb\nsystems like warm-dense matter (WDM). The staples of SCCS are wide-ranged,\nviz., equation of state, plasma spectroscopy, opacity (absorption, emission),\nscattering, level shifts, transport properties, e.g., electrical and heat\nconductivity, laser- and shock- created plasmas, their energy relaxation and\ntransient properties etc. These calculations need pseudopotentials and\nexchange-correlation functionals applicable to finite-$T$ Coulomb systems that\nmay be used in ab initio codes, molecular dynamics, etc. The search for simpler\ncomputational schemes has proceeded via proposals for orbital-free DFT,\nstatistical potentials, classical maps of quantum systems using classical\nschemes like HNC to include strong coupling effects (CHNC).

For the\nall-path query semantics, we show that the result of a query can be represented\nby a finite context-free grammar annotated with node-information relevant for\nderiving each path in the query result. For the single-path query semantics, we\npropose to search for a path of minimum length. We reduce the problem of\nfinding such a path of minimum length to finding a string of minimum length in\na context-free language, and for deriving such a string we propose a novel\nalgorithm.\n  Our initial results show that the path-based query semantics have added\npractical value and that query evaluation for both path-based query semantics\nis feasible, even when query results grow very large. For the single-path query\nsemantics, determining strict worst-case upper bounds on the size of the query\nresult remains the focus of future work.\n"]}]

This measure, which we call Tolerant Edit Distance (TED),\nis motivated by two observations: (1) Some errors, like small boundary shifts,\nare tolerable in practice. Which errors are tolerable is application dependent\nand should be a parameter of the measure. (2) Non-tolerable errors have to be\ncorrected manually. The time needed to do so should be reflected by the error\nmeasure. Using integer linear programming, the TED finds the minimal weighted\nsum of split and merge errors exceeding a given tolerance criterion, and thus\nprovides a time-to-fix estimate. In contrast to commonly used measures like\nRand index or variation of information, the TED (1) does not count small, but\ntolerable, differences, (2) provides intuitive numbers, (3) gives a time-to-fix\nestimate, and (4) can localize and classify the type of errors. By supporting\nboth isotropic and anisotropic volumes and having a flexible tolerance\ncriterion, the TED can be adapted to different requirements.

By detecting reactor antineutrinos from two power plants\nat 53-km distance, JUNO will determine the neutrino mass hierarchy at a 3-4\nsigma significance with six years of running. The measurement of antineutrino\nspectrum will also lead to the precise determination of three out of the six\noscillation parameters to an accuracy of better than 1\\%. Neutrino burst from a\ntypical core-collapse supernova at 10 kpc would lead to ~5000\ninverse-beta-decay events and ~2000 all-flavor neutrino-proton elastic\nscattering events in JUNO. Detection of DSNB would provide valuable information\non the cosmic star-formation rate and the average core-collapsed neutrino\nenergy spectrum. Geo-neutrinos can be detected in JUNO with a rate of ~400\nevents per year, significantly improving the statistics of existing geoneutrino\nsamples. The JUNO detector is sensitive to several exotic searches, e.g. proton\ndecay via the $p\\to K^++\\bar\\nu$ decay channel. The JUNO detector will provide\na unique facility to address many outstanding crucial questions in particle and\nastrophysics.

The nuclear norm in LRR does not sufficiently use the prior knowledge\nof the rank which is known in many practical problems. The LRR is designed for\nvectorial data from linear spaces, thus not suitable for high dimensional data\nwith intrinsic non-linear manifold structure.

The\nnew model not only enforces the global structure of data in low rank, but also\nretains important information by minimizing only smaller singular values. To\nfurther maintain the local structures among Grassmann points, we also integrate\nthe Laplacian penalty with GPSSVR.

Existing VM management algorithms fall into two\ncategories based on whether the VMs' resource demands are assumed to be static\nor dynamic. The former category fails to maximize the resource utilization as\nthey cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of VMs' resource demands. Most\napproaches in the latter category are heuristical and lack theoretical\nperformance guarantees. In this work, we formulate dynamic VM management as a\nlarge-scale Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and derive an optimal\nsolution.

Extensive\nsimulations based on two real-world workload traces show that MadVM achieves\nsignificant performance gains over two existing baseline approaches in power\nconsumption, resource shortage and the number of VM migrations.

Contrarily to previous approaches, PPA reduces to performing\nsimple univariate regressions, which makes it computationally feasible and\nrobust. Moreover, PPA shows a number of interesting analytical properties.\nFirst, PPA is a volume-preserving map, which in turn guarantees the existence\nof the inverse. Second, such an inverse can be obtained in closed form.\nInvertibility is an important advantage over other learning methods, because it\npermits to understand the identified features in the input domain where the\ndata has physical meaning. Moreover, it allows to evaluate the performance of\ndimensionality reduction in sensible (input-domain) units. Volume preservation\nalso allows an easy computation of information theoretic quantities, such as\nthe reduction in multi-information after the transform. Third, the analytical\nnature of PPA leads to a clear geometrical interpretation of the manifold: it\nallows the computation of Frenet-Serret frames (local features) and of\ngeneralized curvatures at any point of the space.

The concept of a buried gate containing\nlocalized deep level centers for holes (Deep Trapping Gate or DTG) renders\npossible the operation of this field effect pixel detector. One alternative to\nDeep Level introduction is the use of a quantum box, which is a hole\nquantum-well and an electron barrier. In all of these cases the buried gate\nmodulates the drain-source current. This principle was formerly evaluated with\nrealistic simulations parameters and this shows that a measurable signal is\nobtained for an energy deposition of a minimum-ionizing particle within a\nlimited silicon thickness. In this work a quantitative study of the response of\nsuch a pixel to Minimum Ionizing Particles. The influence of some parameters\nsuch as the thickness of the pixel and its lateral dimensions, on the operation\nof the pixel is studied here using current available simulation tools, in\nquantum mode when a narrow Ge layer is used as a buried gate. A bias sequence\nis introduced here to separate the operation of the pixel in detection and\nreadout mode. The first frabrication technique introduced is deep impurity\nimplantation, followed by annealing. Recent work on quantum boxes and dots\nopens the possibility to the use Ge boxes as a DTG.Ion implantation and\nalternative methods such an epitaxial growth DTG can be reasonably considered.\nIf the related bottlenecks are overcome the pixel should be a good candidate\nfor high luminosity particle collider inner detectors, provides that its\npotential radiation hardness is proven sufficient for these applications.\n","Comment: IWORID conference 2015 paper submitted.
