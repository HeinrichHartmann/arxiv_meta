Recently, Majorana's\nspirit returns in modern condensed matter physics -- in the context of\ntopological Majorana zero modes in certain classes of topological\nsuperconductors(TSCs). In this paper, we attempt to investigate the topological\nnature of the neutrino by assuming that a relativistic Majorana fermion can be\ndivided into four topological Majorana zero modes at cutoff energy scale, e.g.\nplanck scale. We begin with an exactly solvable $1$D lattice model which\nrealizes a $T^2=-1$ time reversal symmetry protected TSC, and show that a pair\nof topological Majorana zero modes can realize a $T^4=-1$ time reversal\nsymmetry.Moreover, we find that a pair of topological Majorana zero modes can\nalso realize a $P^4=-1$ parity symmetry and even a nontrivial $\\overline\nC^4=-1$ charge conjugation symmetry. Next, we argue that the origin of three\ngenerations of neutrinos(charged leptons and quarks) can be naturally explained\nas three distinguishable ways of forming a pair of complex fermions(with\nopposite spin polarizations) out of four topological Majorana zero modes,\ncharacterized by the $T^4=-1$, $(TP)^4=-1$ and $(T \\overline C)^4=-1$\nfractionalized symmetries that each complex fermion carries at cutoff energy\nscale.

In 1909, Jacobsthal considered a third, intermediate way of\nmultiplying ordinals (denoted $\\times$), defined by transfinite iteration of\nnatural addition, as well as the notion of exponentiation defined by\ntransfinite iteration of his multiplication, which we denote\n$\\alpha^{\\times\\beta}$. (Jacobsthal's multiplication was later rediscovered by\nConway.) Jacobsthal showed these operations too obeyed algebraic laws. In this\npaper, we pick up where Jacobsthal left off by considering the notion of\nexponentiation obtained by transfinitely iterating natural multiplication\ninstead; we will denote this $\\alpha^{\\otimes\\beta}$. We show that\n$\\alpha^{\\otimes(\\beta\\oplus\\gamma)} = (\\alpha^{\\otimes\\beta})\n\\otimes(\\alpha^{\\otimes\\gamma})$ and that\n$\\alpha^{\\otimes(\\beta\\times\\gamma)}=(\\alpha^{\\otimes\\beta})^{\\otimes\\gamma}$;\nnote the use of Jacobsthal's multiplication in the latter.

Variable selection for\nkernel regression models is a challenge partly because, unlike the linear\nregression setting, there is no clear concept of an effect size for regression\ncoefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that provides an\nanalog of the effect size of each explanatory variable for Bayesian kernel\nregression models when the kernel is shift-invariant---for example the Gaussian\nkernel. We use function analytic properties of shift-invariant reproducing\nkernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) to define a linear vector space that (1) captures\nnonlinear structure and (2) can be projected onto the original explanatory\nvariables. The projection onto the original explanatory variables serves as the\nanalog of effect sizes.

Previous $Spitzer$ IRAC studies identifying this \"canyon\" have been\nlimited by small number statistics. We utilize whole-sky WISE data to study 163\ncompact groups, thereby tripling our previous sample and including more\ngalaxies with intermediate mid-IR colors indicative of moderate specific star\nformation rates (SSFRs).

A complementary method relies on the\nabsorption imprint from neutral gas in galaxies, the so-called damped Ly-alpha\nabsorbers (DLAs) seen towards distant bright objects. This thesis seeks to\nunderstand how the absorption selected galaxies relate to the emission selected\ngalaxies by identifying the faint glow from the absorbing galaxies at redshift\nz~2.\n  In the last Chapter, a study of the more evolved, massive galaxies is\npresented. These galaxies are observed to be a factor of 2 to 6 times smaller\nthan local galaxies of similar masses.
