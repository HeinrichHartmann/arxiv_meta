We calculate these\nradiatively generated masses and find that they are many orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the observed neutrino masses and splittings. Thus, some lepton\nnumber violating New Physics (which may at tree-level not be related to\nneutrino masses) may induce Black Box operators which can explain an observed\nrate of neutrinoless double beta decay. Although these operators guarantee\nfinite Majorana neutrino masses, the smallness of the Black Box contributions\nimplies that other neutrino mass terms (Dirac or Majorana) must exist. If\nneutrino masses have a significant Majorana contribution then this will become\nthe dominant part of the Black Box operator. However, neutrinos might also be\npredominantly Dirac particles, while other lepton number violating New Physics\ndominates neutrinoless double beta decay. Translating an observed rate of\nneutrinoless double beta decay into neutrino masses would then be completely\nmisleading. Although the principal statement of the Schechter-Valle theorem\nremains valid, we conclude that the Black Box diagram itself generates\nradiatively only mass terms which are many orders of magnitude too small to\nexplain neutrino masses.

We revisit the\nbehavior of in-plane $H_{c2}$ in $d$-wave superconductors by considering both\nthe orbital effect and Pauli paramagnetic effect. After carrying out systematic\nanalysis, we show that the maxima of $H_{c2}$ could be along either nodal or\nantinodal directions of a $d$-wave superconducting gap, depending on the\nspecific values of a number of tuning parameters. This behavior is in contrast\nto the common belief that the maxima of in-plane $H_{c2}$ are along the\ndirection where the superconducting gap takes its maximal value. Therefore,\nidentifying the precise $d$-wave gap symmetry through fitting experiments\nresults of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ with model calculations at a fixed\ntemperature, as widely used in previous studies, is difficult and practically\nunreliable. However, our extensive analysis of angle-resolved $H_{c2}$ show\nthat there is a critical temperature $T^{*}$: in-plane $H_{c2}$ exhibits its\nmaxima along nodal directions at $T < T^{*}$ and along antinodal directions at\n$T^{*} < T < T_c$. The concrete value of $T^{*}$ may change as other parameters\nvary, but the existence of $\\pi/4$ shift of $H_{c2}$ at $T^{\\ast}$ appears to\nbe a general feature.

We further show that Landau level mixing does not change this general\nfeature.

In this paper, we study the response of real-world spatio-temporal\nnetworks to random error and systematic attack, taking a unified view of their\nspatial and temporal performance. We propose a model of spatio-temporal paths\nin time-varying spatially embedded networks which captures the property that,\nas in many real-world systems, interaction between nodes is non-instantaneous\nand governed by the space in which they are embedded. Through numerical\nexperiments on three real-world urban transport systems, we study the effect of\nnode failure on a network's topological, temporal and spatial structure. We\nalso demonstrate the broader applicability of this framework to three other\nclasses of network. To identify weaknesses specific to the behaviour of a\nspatio-temporal system, we introduce centrality measures that evaluate the\nimportance of a node as a structural bridge and its role in supporting\nspatio-temporally efficient flows through the network. This exposes the complex\nnature of fragility in a spatio-temporal system, showing that there is a\nvariety of failure modes when a network is subject to systematic attacks.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables"]}]

Previous studies using simulated\nphotometry of Earth show that continuous observations over most of a planet's\norbit can be inverted to infer obliquity. However, few studies of more general\nplanets with arbitrary albedo markings have been made and, in particular, a\nsimple theoretical understanding of why it is possible to extract obliquity\nfrom light curves is missing. Reflected light seen by a distant observer is the\nproduct of a planet's albedo map, its host star's illumination, and the\nvisibility of different regions. It is useful to treat the product of\nillumination and visibility as the kernel of a convolution. Time-resolved\nphotometry constrains both the albedo map and the kernel, the latter of which\nsweeps over the planet due to rotational and orbital motion. The kernel's\nmovement distinguishes prograde from retrograde rotation for planets with\nnon-zero obliquity on inclined orbits. We demonstrate that the kernel's\nlongitudinal width and mean latitude are distinct functions of obliquity and\naxial orientation. Notably, we find that a planet's spin axis affects the\nkernel -- and hence time-resolved photometry -- even if this planet is\nEast-West uniform or spinning rapidly, or if it is North-South uniform. We find\nthat perfect knowledge of the kernel at 2-4 orbital phases is usually\nsufficient to uniquely determine a planet's spin axis.

However, it is also common that users search for non-popular\nevents, which may not exhibit temporal variations in query streams, e.g., past\nevents recently occurred, historical events triggered by anniversaries or\nsimilar events, and future events anticipated to happen. To address the\nchallenge of detecting dynamic classes of events, we propose a novel deep\nlearning model to classify a given query into a predetermined set of multiple\nevent types. Our proposed model, a Stacked Multilayer Perceptron (S-MLP)\nnetwork, consists of multilayer perceptron used as a basic learning unit. We\nassemble stacked units to further learn complex relationships between neutrons\nin successive layers. To evaluate our proposed model, we conduct experiments\nusing real-world queries and a set of manually created ground truth.\nPreliminary results have shown that our proposed deep learning model\noutperforms the state-of-the-art classification models significantly.\n","Comment: Neu-IR '16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval, 6 pages, 4\n  figures"]}]

In this paper, the problem of AoA estimation in\nRician flat fading channel under jamming condition is investigated. We consider\nthe scenario in which a receiver with multiple antenna is trying to estimate\nthe AoA of the specular line of sight (LOS) component of signal received from a\ngiven single antenna transmitter using a predefined training sequence.

In\nall scenarios, we derive the optimal jammer signal design as well as its\noptimal power allocation policy. The results show the optimality of the\ntraining based Maximum Likelihood (ML) AoA estimator in case of randomly\ngenerated jamming signal. We also show that, the optimal jammer strategy is to\nemit a signal identical to the predefined training sequence turning the\nestimation process into a highest power competition scenario in which the\ndetected AoA is the one for the transmitting entity of higher power.

To this end, it uses belief propagation, thanks to which\nhigh-dimensional distributions can be sampled efficiently, thus making a\nBayesian approach to inference tractable. The resulting algorithms undergo\nphase transitions just as physical systems do. These phase transitions can be\nanalyzed using the replica method, initially developed in statistical physics\nof disordered systems. The analysis reveals phases in which inference is easy,\nhard or impossible. These phases correspond to different energy landscapes of\nthe problem. The main contributions of this thesis can be divided into three\ncategories. First, the application of known algorithms to concrete problems:\ncommunity detection, superposition codes and an innovative imaging system.\nSecond, a new, efficient message-passing algorithm for a class of problems\ncalled blind sensor calibration. Third, a theoretical analysis of matrix\ncompressed sensing and of instabilities in Bayesian bilinear inference\nalgorithms.\n","Comment: Phd thesis"]}]

Specifically, we analyze the distributional\napproximation of linear contrasts $c^{\\top} (\\hat{\\beta}_{\\rho}-\\beta)$, where\n$\\hat{\\beta}_{\\rho}$ is a ridge-regression estimator. When regression\ncoefficients are estimated via least squares, classical results show that RB\nconsistently approximates the laws of contrasts, provided that $p\\ll n$, where\nthe design matrix is of size $n\\times p$. Up to now, relatively little work has\nconsidered how additional structure in the linear model may extend the validity\nof RB to the setting where $p/n\\asymp 1$. In this setting, we propose a version\nof RB that resamples residuals obtained from ridge regression. Our main\nstructural assumption on the design matrix is that it is nearly low rank --- in\nthe sense that its singular values decay according to a power-law profile.\nUnder a few extra technical assumptions, we derive a simple criterion for\nensuring that RB consistently approximates the law of a given contrast.

To tackle these limitations,\nin this paper, we propose a dynamic, transparent and privacy-driven access\ncontrol mechanism for textual messages published in OSNs. The notion of\nprivacy-driven is achieved by analyzing the semantics of the messages to be\npublished and, according to that, assessing the degree of sensitiveness of\ntheir contents. For this purpose, the proposed system relies on an automatic\nsemantic annotation mechanism that, by using knowledge bases and linguistic\ntools, is able to associate a meaning to the information to be published.

Finally, our\naccess control mechanism automatically creates sanitized versions of the users'\npublications according to the type of reader that accesses them. As a result,\nour proposal, which can be integrated in already existing social networks,\nprovides an automatic, seamless and content-driven protection of user\npublications, which are coherent with her privacy requirements and the type of\nreaders that access them.

Notably, we focus on the invasive dynamics of external agents,\nlike bacteria, within a host organism. The former are mapped to a population of\ndefectors, that aim to spread in the extracellular medium of the latter. In\nturn, the host organism is composed of cells mapped to a population of\ncooperators, that aim to remove pathogens. The cooperative behavior of cells\nallows to support the living functions of the whole organism, since each one\nprovides an unitary amount of energy. When one or more bacteria are spatially\nclose to a cell, the latter may use a fraction of its energy to remove them. On\nthe other hand, when a bacterium survives an attack, it absorbs the received\nenergy, becoming stronger and more resistant to further attacks. In addition,\nsince bacteria play as defectors, they aim only to increase their wealth,\nwithout supporting their own kind. As in many living organisms, the host\ntemperature plays a relevant role in host-pathogen equilibria. In particular,\ncooperators succeed when bacteria are completely removed, while the opposite\noutcome entails the host undergoes a deep invasive process, like a blood\npoisoning. Results of numerical simulations show that the dynamics of the\nproposed model allow to reach a variety of equilibria. Here it is worth noting\nthat, on a quality level, the achieved outcomes describe some real scenarios,\nthat can be observed in living systems. To conclude, we deem that our model\nmight open the way to further developments, based on evolutionary game theory,\nfor studying several complex biological phenomena.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Penrose has suggested a mechanism for objective reduction of\nquantum states with postulated collapse time T = h/E, where E is an\nill-definedness in the gravitational self-energy stemming from the profound\nconflict between the principles of superposition and general covariance. Here\nit is argued that, even if Penrose's overall conceptual scheme for the\nbreakdown of quantum mechanics is unreservedly accepted, his formula for the\ncollapse time of superpositions reduces to T --> oo (E --> 0) in the strictly\nNewtonian regime, which is the domain of his proposed experiment to corroborate\nthe effect. A suggestion is made to rectify this situation. In particular,\nrecognising the cogency of Penrose's reasoning in the domain of full `quantum\ngravity', it is demonstrated that an appropriate experiment which could in\nprinciple corroborate his argued `macroscopic' breakdown of superpositions is\nnot the one involving non-rotating mass distributions as he has suggested, but\na Leggett-type SQUID or BEC experiment involving superposed mass distributions\nin relative rotation. The demonstration thereby brings out one of the\ndistinctive characteristics of Penrose's scheme, rendering it empirically\ndistinguishable from other state reduction theories involving gravity. As an\naside, a new geometrical measure of gravity-induced deviation from quantum\nmechanics in the manner of Penrose is proposed, but now for the canonical\ncommutation relations [Q, P] = ih.\n","Comment: 33 pages (TeX, uses mtexsis) plus 3 figures (epsf).
