They are first\nintroduced in the field of universal algebra to deal with algebras equipped\nwith metric structures such as normed vector spaces. Recently a similar notion\nof quantitative algebra is used in computer science to formulate computational\neffects of probabilistic programs. In this paper we show that varieties of\nmetric algebras (classes defined by a set of metric equations) are exactly\nclasses closed under (metric versions of) subalgebras, products and quotients.\nThis result implies the class of normed vector spaces cannot be defined by\nmetric equations, differently from the classical case where the class of vector\nspaces is equational. This phenomenon suggests that metric equations are not a\nvery natural class of formulas since they cannot express such a typical class\nof metric algebras. Therefore we need a broader class of formulas to acquire an\nappropriate metric counterpart of the classical variety theory.\n"]}]

To solve the\nadvection-diffusion differential equation, it is first proposed two efficient\nnumerical schemes and their efficiencies are investigated for both linear and\nnonlinear cases. The first scheme, Scharfetter-Gummel (SG), presents a\nCourant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition but is more accurate and faster than\nthe second scheme, the well-known Crank-Nicolson approach. Furthermore, the SG\nscheme has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically preserved.\nThen, to conclude, results of the convective moisture transfer problem obtained\nwith the SG numerical scheme are compared to experimental data from the\nliterature.

However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the\ndesired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image\ndistributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U)\nlearning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a\nsimulator's output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation\ninformation from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses\nan adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but\nwith synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key\nmodifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid\nartifacts and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a\nlocal adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of\nrefined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic\nimages, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We\nquantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze\nestimation and hand pose estimation.

Although reprogramming has been demonstrated\nexperimentally, much of the underlying processes governing cell fate decisions\nremain unknown. This work aims to bridge this gap by modelling cell types as a\nset of hierarchically related dynamical attractors representing cell cycles.\nStages of the cell cycle are characterised by the configuration of gene\nexpression levels, and reprogramming corresponds to triggering transitions\nbetween such configurations. Two mechanisms were found for reprogramming in a\ntwo level hierarchy: cycle specific perturbations and a noise-induced\nswitching. The former corresponds to a \\emph{directed} perturbation that\ninduces a transition into a cycle state of a different cell type in the potency\nhierarchy (mainly a stem cell) whilst the latter is a priori undirected and\ncould be induced, e.g., by a (stochastic) change in the cellular environment.\nThese reprogramming protocols were found to be effective in large regimes of\nthe parameter space and make specific predictions concerning reprogramming\ndynamics which are broadly in line with experimental findings.\n"]}]
