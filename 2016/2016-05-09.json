Recently researchers developed the\nquasi-potential theory to represent the Waddington's landscape. The\nQuasi-potential U(x), derived from interactions in the gene regulatory network\n(GRN) of a cell, quantifies the relative stability of network states, which\ndetermine the effort required for state transitions in a multi-stable dynamical\nsystem. However, quasi-potential landscapes, originally developed for\ncontinuous systems, are not suitable for discrete-valued networks which are\nimportant tools to study complex systems. In this paper, we provide a framework\nto quantify the landscape for discrete Boolean networks (BNs). We apply our\nframework to study pancreas cell differentiation where an ensemble of BN models\nis considered based on the structure of a minimal GRN for pancreas development.\nWe impose biologically motivated structural constraints (corresponding to\nspecific type of Boolean functions) and dynamical constraints (corresponding to\nstable attractor states) to limit the space of BN models for pancreas\ndevelopment. In addition, we enforce a novel functional constraint\ncorresponding to the relative ordering of attractor states in BN models to\nrestrict the space of BN models to the biological relevant class. We find that\nBNs with canalyzing/sign-compatible Boolean functions best capture the dynamics\nof pancreas cell differentiation. This framework can also determine the genes'\ninfluence on cell state transitions, and thus can facilitate the rational\ndesign of cell reprogramming protocols.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

In many regions the coastally-affected rainfall\nconsitutes more than half of the overall rainfall received. Weather and climate\nmodels with parametrized convection produce large errors in rainfall in\ntropical coastal regions, most commonly underestimating rainfall over land and\noverestimating it over the ocean. Building on an algorithm to objectively\nidentify rainfall that is associated with land-sea interaction we investigate\nwhether the relationship between rainfall in coastal regions and the\nlarge-scale atmosphere differs from that over the open ocean or over inland\nareas. We combine 3-hourly satellite estimates of rainfall with estimates of\nthe large-scale atmospheric state from reanalyses. We find that when grouped by\nrainfall intensity, medium-intensity coastal rainfall in the tropics occurs in\nmore stable conditions and drier atmospheres and is associated with less\nlarge-scale convergence than its open-ocean and inland counterparts. Overall,\nthe dependence of the amount of rainfall on the large-scale state is\nsignificantly weaker when the rainfall is coastally influenced. Our findings\nindicate that the representation of convection in weather and climate models\nmust cater for the special character of the large-to-small scale relationship\nnear coasts rather than rely on a common set of rules across the globe.\n","Comment: Paper has been withdrawn due to faulty data used in this study"]}]

The BAT has been\nknown to induce naturally occurring failures of human-machine coupling in high\nperformance aircraft that can potentially lead to a crash; these failures are\ntermed pilot induced oscillations (PIOs). Approach. We recorded EEG and\npupillometry data from human subjects engaged in a flight BAT simulated within\na virtual 3D environment. Main results. We find that workload buildup in a BAT\ncan be successfully decoded from oscillatory features in the\nelectroencephalogram (EEG). Information in delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma\nspectral bands of the EEG all contribute to successful decoding, however gamma\nband activity with a lateralized somatosensory topography has the highest\ncontribution, while theta band activity with a frontocentral topography has the\nmost robust contribution in terms of real world usability. We show that the\noutput of the spectral decoder can be used to predict PIO susceptibility. We\nalso find that workload buildup in the task induces pupil dilation, the\nmagnitude of which is significantly correlated with the magnitude of the\ndecoded EEG signals. These results suggest that PIOs may result from the\ndysregulation of cortical networks such as the locus coeruleus (LC) anterior\ncingulate cortex (ACC) circuit. Significance. Our findings may generalize to\nsimilar control failures in other cases of tight man machine coupling where\ngains and latencies in the control system must be inferred and compensated for\nby the human operators. A closed-loop intervention using neurophysiological\ndecoding of workload buildup that targets the LC ACC circuit may positively\nimpact operator performance in such situations.\n","Comment: Manuscript as initially submitted to Journal of Neural Engineering in\n  March, 2016"]}]

Motility of M. xanthus depends on two\nmotility machineries: the S-engine and A-engine. Moving M. xanthus cells can\norganize into spreading colonies or spore-filled fruiting bodies depending on\ntheir nutritional status. To understand these two pattern formation processes\nand the contributions by the two motility machineries, as well as cell\nreversal, we analyze spatial self-organization in 3 strains: i) a mutant that\nmoves unidirectionally without reversing by the A-motility system only, ii) a\nunidirectional mutant that is also equipped with the S-motility system, and\niii) the wild-type that, in addition to the two motility systems, reverses its\ndirection of movement. The mutant moving by the A-engine illustrates that\ncollective motion in the form of large moving clusters can arise in gliding\nbacteria due to steric interactions of the rod-shaped cells, without the need\nof invoking any biochemical signal regulation. The two-engine strain mutant\nreveals that the same phenomenon emerges when both motility systems are\npresent, and as long as cells exhibit unidirectional motion only. From the\nstudy of these two strains, we conclude that unidirectional cell motion induces\nthe formation of large moving clusters at low and intermediate densities, while\nit results into vortex formation at very high densities. These findings are\nconsistent with what is known from self-propelled rods which strongly suggests\nthat the combined effect of self-propulsion and volume exclusion interactions\nis the pattern formation mechanism leading to the observed phenomena.

We compute several basic network statistics and check,\nwith the Louvain community detection algorithm, for emerging communities of\nbanks. Remarkably enough sensible regional aggregations show up with the\nJapanese and the US clusters dominating the community structure, although the\npresence of a geographically mixed community points to a gradual convergence of\nbanks into similar supranational practices.
