Following the\nwork of Schoenberg [Duke Math. J. 9], Rudin [Duke Math. J. 26], and others, it\nis well-known that functions preserving positivity for matrices of all\ndimensions are absolutely monotonic (i.e., analytic with nonnegative Taylor\ncoefficients). In this paper, we study functions preserving positivity when\napplied entrywise to sparse matrices, with zeros encoded by a graph $G$ or a\nfamily of graphs $G_n$. Our results generalize Schoenberg and Rudin's results\nto a modern setting, where functions are often applied entrywise to sparse\nmatrices in order to improve their properties (e.g. better conditioning). The\nonly such result known in the literature is for the complete graph $K_2$. We\nprovide the first such characterization result for a large family of\nnon-complete graphs. Specifically, we characterize functions preserving Loewner\npositivity on matrices with zeros according to a tree. These functions are\nmultiplicatively midpoint-convex and super-additive. Leveraging the underlying\nsparsity in matrices thus admits the use of functions which are not necessarily\nanalytic nor absolutely monotonic. We further show that analytic functions\npreserving positivity on matrices with zeros according to trees can contain\narbitrarily long sequences of negative coefficients, thus obviating the need\nfor absolute monotonicity in a very strong sense. This result leads to the\nquestion of exactly when absolute monotonicity is necessary when preserving\npositivity for an arbitrary class of graphs. We then provide a stronger\ncondition in terms of the numerical range of all symmetric matrices, such that\nfunctions satisfying this condition on matrices with zeros according to any\nfamily of graphs with unbounded degrees are necessarily absolutely monotonic.\n","Comment: Final version (updated references + minor edits); 21 pages, to appear\n  in Transactions of the AMS"]}]

A peak\nperformance of 2.2M database inserts per second was achieved on a single node\nof this system. We also show that SciDB and the D4M toolbox provide more\nefficient ways to access random sub-volumes of massive datasets compared to the\ntraditional approaches of reading volumetric data from individual files. This\nwork describes the D4M and SciDB tools we developed and presents the initial\nperformance results.

We\nreport here on a simulation of radiation from positrons passing through the\ncalorimeter system. We carry out the simulation using Geant4 toolkit, which\nprovides a complete set of tools for all areas of detector simulation:\ngeometry, tracking, detector response, run, event and track management, and\nvisualization. We consider Cherenkov photons expansion when a positron moves\ndown through the calorimeter at the arbitrary angle of incidence. Both spectral\nand angular distributions of Cherenkov optical photons in different parts of\nthe calorimeter system have been evaluated as well as the transition radiation\nand pre-shower distributions from the panel and from the Al vacuum chamber of\nthe storage ring.

In phase 1, a diffuse foreground cleaned map is\nobtained by performing a usual ILC operation in the harmonic space in a single\niteration over the desired portion of the sky. In phase 2, we obtain the final\nforeground cleaned map using an iterative ILC approach also in the harmonic\nspace, however, now, during each iteration of foreground minimization, some of\nthe regions of the sky that are not being cleaned in the current iteration, are\nreplaced by the corresponding cleaned portions of the phase 1 cleaned map. The\nnew ILC method nullifies a foreground leakage signal that is otherwise\ninevitably present in the old and usual harmonic space iterative ILC method.\nThe new method is flexible to handle input frequency maps, irrespective of\nwhether or not they initially have the same instrumental and pixel resolution,\nby bringing them to a common and maximum possible beam and pixel resolution at\nthe beginning of the analysis. This dramatically reduces data redundancy and\nhence memory usage and computational cost.

Because of this splitting and\nthe spin-polarized character of the valence bands, the lowest-lying excitonic\nstates in WX2 (X=S, Se) are expected to be spin-forbidden and optically dark.\nTo date, however, there has been no direct experimental probe of these dark\nband-edge excitons, which strongly influence the light emission properties of\nthe material.

Greatly increased emission and valley lifetimes were\nobserved for the brightened dark states as a result of their spin\nconfiguration.

The gravitational\ncollapse of a large sample of model cores in the mass range 0.1-2.0 Msun is\ninvestigated. Numerical simulations were started at the pre-stellar phase and\nterminated at the end of the embedded phase when 90% of the initial core mass\nhad been accreted onto the forming protostar plus disk system. The disk\nformation and evolution was studied using numerical hydrodynamics simulations,\nwhile the formation and evolution of the central star was calculated using a\nstellar evolution code. Three scenarios for mass accretion from the disk onto\nthe star were considered: hybrid accretion in which a fraction of accreted\nenergy absorbed by the protostar depends on the accretion rate, hot accretion\nwherein a fraction of accreted energy is constant, and cold accretion wherein\nall accretion energy is radiated away. Our conclusions on the nature of VeLLOs\ndepend crucially on the character of protostellar accretion. In the hybrid\naccretion scenario, most VeLLOs (90.6%) are expected to be the first\nhydrostatic cores (FHSCs) and only a small fraction (9.4%) are true protostars.\nIn the hot accretion scenario, all VeLLOs are FHSCs due to overly high\nphotospheric luminosity of protostars. In the cold accretion scenario, on the\ncontrary, the majority of VeLLOs belong to the Class I phase of stellar\nevolution. The reason is that the stellar photospheric luminosity, which sets\nthe floor for the total internal luminosity of a young star, is lower in cold\naccretion, thus enabling more VeLLOs in the protostellar stage. VeLLOs are\nrelatively rare objects occupying 7%-11% of the total duration of the embedded\nphase and their masses do not exceed 0.3 Msun.

The disorder induced\nlocalized states form isolated local channels that make the output laser beam\nhighly directional and stabilize its spectrum. The strong transverse disorder\nand longitudinal invariance result in isolated lasing modes with negligible\ninteraction with their surroundings, traveling back and forth in a Fabry-Perot\ncavity formed by the air-fiber interfaces. It is shown that if a localized\ninput pump is scanned across the disordered fiber input facet, the output laser\nsignal follows the transverse position of the pump. Moreover, a uniformly\ndistributed pump across the input facet of the disordered fiber generates a\nlaser signal with very low spatial coherence that can be of practical\nimportance in many optical platforms including image transport with fiber\nbundles.\n"]}]

We take advantage of Wikipedia's category\nstructure, and rank an entity's categories by their trivia-quality.\n  Our algorithm is capable of finding interesting facts, such as Obama's Grammy\nor Elvis' stint as a tank gunner. In user studies, our algorithm captures the\nintuitive notion of \"good trivia\" 45\\% higher than prior work. Search-page\ntests show a 22\\% decrease in bounce rates and a 12\\% increase in dwell time,\nproving our facts hold users' attention.\n","Comment: To appear in Proceedings of tenth ACM International Conference on Web\n  Search and Data Mining, WSDM 2017"]}]

We find that when delensing CMB acoustic peaks with a lensing\npotential map derived from the same CMB sky, a large bias arises in the\ndelensed power spectrum. The cause of this bias is that the noise in the\nreconstructed potential map is derived from, and hence correlated with, the CMB\nmap when delensing. This bias is more significant relative to the signal than\nan analogous bias found when delensing CMB B modes. We calculate the leading\nterm of this bias, which is present even in the absence of lensing. We also\ndemonstrate one method to remove this bias, using reconstructions from CMB\nangular scales within given ranges to delens CMB scales outside of those\nranges. Some details relevant for a realistic analysis are also discussed, such\nas the importance of removing mask-induced effects for successful delensing,\nand a useful null test, obtained from randomizing the phases of the\nreconstructed potential. Our findings should help current and next-generation\nCMB experiments obtain tighter parameter constraints via the internal removal\nof lensing-induced smoothing from temperature and E-mode acoustic peaks.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Most traditional hashing\nmethods first represent images as off-the-shelf visual features and then\nproduce hashing codes in a separate stage. However, off-the-shelf visual\nfeatures may not be optimally compatible with the hash code learning procedure,\nwhich may result in sub-optimal hash codes. Recently, deep hashing methods have\nbeen proposed to simultaneously learn image features and hash codes using deep\nneural networks and have shown superior performance over traditional hashing\nmethods. Most deep hashing methods are given supervised information in the form\nof pairwise labels or triplet labels. The current state-of-the-art deep hashing\nmethod DPSH~\\cite{li2015feature}, which is based on pairwise labels, performs\nimage feature learning and hash code learning simultaneously by maximizing the\nlikelihood of pairwise similarities. Inspired by DPSH~\\cite{li2015feature}, we\npropose a triplet label based deep hashing method which aims to maximize the\nlikelihood of the given triplet labels. Experimental results show that our\nmethod outperforms all the baselines on CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets,\nincluding the state-of-the-art method DPSH~\\cite{li2015feature} and all the\nprevious triplet label based deep hashing methods.\n","Comment: Appear in ACCV 2016"]}]

We use controlled N-body simulations of galaxies to study the\ngravitational effect of baryons in a scenario with collisionless cold dark\nmatter (CDM) versus one with a self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) component.\nIn particular, we examine the inner profiles of the rotation curves in the\nvelocity range Vmax = 30-250 km/s, whose diversity has been found to be greater\nthan predicted by the Lambda-CDM scenario. We find that the scatter in the\nobserved rotation curves exceeds that predicted by dark matter only\nmass-concentration relations in either the CDM nor SIDM models. Allowing for\nrealistic baryonic content and spatial distributions, however, helps create a\nlarge variety of rotation curve shapes; which is in better agreement with\nobservations in the case of self-interactions due to the characteristic cored\nprofiles being more accommodating to the slowly rising rotation curves than\nCDM. We find individual fits to model two of the most remarkable outliers of\nsimilar Vmax, UGC 5721 and IC 2574, the former a cusp-like rotation curve and\nthe latter a seemingly 8 kpc cored profile. This diversity in SIDM arises as\npermutations of overly concentrated halos with compact baryonic distributions\nversus underdense halos with extended baryonic disks. The SIDM solution is\npromising and its feasibility ultimately depends on the sampling of the halo\nmass-concentration relation and its interplay with the baryonic profiles,\nemphasising the need for a better understanding of the frequency of extreme\noutliers present in current observational samples.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]
