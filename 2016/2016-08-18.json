The\nself-gravity of the disc resists distortion in the inner parts. Applying this\napproach to a galactic disc with an exponential vertical profile, Saha & Jog\nshowed that warps develop beyond 4-6 disc scalelengths, which could hence be\nonly seen in HI. The real galactic discs, however, have less steep vertical\ndensity distributions that lie between a sech and an exponential profile. Here\nwe calculate the disc response for such a general sech^(2/n) density\ndistribution, and show that the warps develop from a smaller radius of 2-4 disc\nscalelengths. This naturally explains why most galaxies show stellar warps that\nstart within the optical radius. Thus a qualitatively different picture of\nubiquitous optical warps emerges for the observed less-steep density profiles.\nThe surprisingly strong dependence on the density profile is due to the fact\nthat the disc self-gravity depends crucially on its mass distribution close to\nthe mid-plane. General results for the radius of onset of warps, obtained as a\nfunction of the disc scalelength and the vertical scaleheight, are presented as\ncontour plots which can be applied to any galaxy.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures.

Characterizing the large scale universe is essential\nto our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. The density\nrange of clusters, walls and voids are relatively well separated, when compared\nto filaments, which span a relatively larger range. The large scale filamentary\nnetwork thus forms an intricate part of the cosmic web.\n  In this paper, we describe Felix, a topology based framework for visual\nexploration of filaments in the cosmic web. The filamentary structure is\nrepresented by the ascending manifold geometry of the 2-saddles in the\nMorse-Smale complex of the density field. We generate a hierarchy of\nMorse-Smale complexes and query for filaments based on the density ranges at\nthe end points of the filaments.

This\nrequires adding a SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R x Z(3)_A nonet of scalar fields, with both\nparities, and coupling these to quarks through a Yukawa coupling, y. Treating\nthe scalar fields in mean field approximation, the effective Lagrangian is\ncomputed by integrating out quarks to one loop order. In addition to the usual\nsymmetry breaking term, linear in the current quark mass m_qk, at a nonzero\ntemperature T it is necessary to add a new term, ~ m_qk T^2. The parameters of\nthe gluon part of the matrix model are identical to that for the pure glue\ntheory without quarks. The parameters in the chiral matrix model are fixed by\nthe values, at zero temperature, of the pion decay constant and the masses of\nthe pions, kaons, eta, and eta'. The temperature for the chiral crossover at\nT_chi = 155 MeV is determined by adjusting the Yukawa coupling y. We find\nreasonable agreement with the results of numerical simulations on the lattice\nfor the pressure and related quantities. In the chiral limit, besides the\ndivergence in the chiral susceptibility there is also a milder divergence in\nthe susceptibility between the Polyakov loop and the chiral order parameter,\nwith critical exponent beta - 1. We compute derivatives with respect to a quark\nchemical potential to determine the susceptibilities for baryon number, the\nchi_2n. Especially sensitive tests are provided by chi_4 - chi_2 and by chi_6,\nwhich changes in sign about T_chi. The behavior of the susceptibilities in the\nchiral matrix model strongly suggests that as the temperature increases from\nT_chi, that the transition to deconfinement is significantly quicker than\nindicated by the measurements of the (renormalized) Polyakov loop on the\nlattice.\n","Comment: 69 pages, 22 figures; version published in PRD"]}]

That is, primordial tensor perturbations\non superhorizon scales can be constrained from the absence of PBHs. In our\nrecent paper we have only shown simple estimations of these new constraints,\nand hence in this paper, we present detailed derivations, solving the Einstein\nequations for scalar perturbations induced at second order in tensor\nperturbations. We also derive an approximate formula for the probability\ndensity function of induced density perturbations, necessary to relate the\nabundance of PBHs to the primordial tensor power spectrum, assuming primordial\ntensor perturbations follow Gaussian distributions. Our new upper bounds from\nPBHs are compared with other existing bounds obtained from big bang\nnucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, LIGO/Virgo and pulsar timing\narrays.\n","Comment: 31 pages, accepted in PRD, this paper presents detailed derivations\n  of the results shown in our recent work 1506.05228"]}]

By measuring stabilizer operators, Arthur also\nchecks the correctness of the graph state.

Our main findings show that the\nclosed-form expression of the distribution of the SIR can be obtained whenever\nthe receive signal power has an Erlang distribution, and an almost closed-form\nexpression can be found if the power-law pathloss model has a pathloss exponent\nof four. In the second part of this paper, we aim to apply the derived\ndistribution of the SIR in finding the two important performance metrics: the\nsuccess probability and ergodic link capacity. For each type of the RXs, the\nsuccess probability with (without) interference cancellation and that with\n(without) the proposed stochastic power control are found in a compact form.\nWith the aid of the derived Shannon transform identity, the ergodic link\ncapacities of K-type RXs are derived with low complexity, and they can be\napplied to many transmitting scenarios, such as multi-antenna communication and\nstochastic power control. Finally, we analyze the spatial throughput capacity\nof the heterogeneous network defined based on the derived K success\nprobabilities and ergodic link capacities and show the existence of its\nmaximum.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 9 figures, journal"]}]

Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), as an\nagent-environment interaction problem, has brought further attention to\nplanning methods. Generally in RL, one can assume a generative model, e.g.\ngraphical models, for the environment, and then the task for the RL agent is to\nlearn the model parameters and find the optimal strategy based on these learnt\nparameters. Based on environment behavior, the agent can assume various types\nof generative models, e.g. Multi Armed Bandit for a static environment, or\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) for a dynamic environment. The advantage of these\npopular models is their simplicity, which results in tractable methods of\nlearning the parameters and finding the optimal policy. The drawback of these\nmodels is again their simplicity: these models usually underfit and\nunderestimate the actual environment behavior. For example, in robotics, the\nagent usually has noisy observations of the environment inner state and MDP is\nnot a suitable model.\n  More complex models like Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP)\ncan compensate for this drawback. Fitting this model to the environment, where\nthe partial observation is given to the agent, generally gives dramatic\nperformance improvement, sometimes unbounded improvement, compared to MDP. In\ngeneral, finding the optimal policy for the POMDP model is computationally\nintractable and fully non convex, even for the class of memoryless policies.\nThe open problem is to come up with a method to find an exact or an approximate\noptimal stochastic memoryless policy for POMDP models.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1602.07764"]}]

We find that while the two-state\nsystem undergoes a single transition in the static case, its Floquet\ncounterpart, with a periodic loss, undergoes PT-symmetry breaking and restoring\ntransitions at vanishingly small dissipation strength. Our results demonstrate\nthat Floquet dissipation offers a versatile tool for navigating phases where\nthe PT-symmetry is either broken or conserved. The dissipative ultracold Fermi\ngas provides a starting point for exploring the interplay among dissipation,\ndecoherence, and interactions in open quantum systems.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, 32 references"]}]

These\ninclude power grid, natural gas transmission network, water pipelines etc. In\nsuch networks, the flow on each edge is characterized by a function of the\nnodal potentials on either side of the edge. Further the net flow in and out of\neach node is conserved. Learning the structure and state of physical networks\nis necessary for optimal control as well as to quantify its privacy needs. We\nconsider radial flow networks and study the problem of learning the operational\nnetwork from a loopy graph of candidate edges using statistics of nodal\npotentials. Based on the monotonic properties of the flow functions, the key\nresult in this paper shows that if variance of the difference of nodal\npotentials is used to weight candidate edges, the operational edges form the\nminimum spanning tree in the loopy graph. Under realistic conditions on the\nstatistics of nodal injection (consumption or production), we provide a greedy\nstructure learning algorithm with quasilinear computational complexity in the\nnumber of candidate edges in the network. Our learning framework is very\ngeneral due to two significant attributes. First it is independent of the\nspecific marginal distributions of nodal potentials and only uses order\nproperties in their second moments. Second, the learning algorithm is agnostic\nto exact flow functions that relate edge flows to corresponding potential\ndifferences and is applicable for a broad class of networks with monotonic flow\nfunctions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our work through realistic\nsimulations on diverse physical flow networks and discuss possible extensions\nof our work to other regimes.\n","Comment: A version of this paper will appear in IEEE CDC 2016 (8 pages, 5\n  figures)"]}]
