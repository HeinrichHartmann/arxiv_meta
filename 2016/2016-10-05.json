The\nstandard dynamic programming solution for this problem computes the\nedit-distance between a pair of strings of total length O(N) in O(N^2) time. To\nthis date, this quadratic upper-bound has never been substantially improved for\ngeneral strings. However, there are known techniques for breaking this bound in\ncase the strings are known to compress well under a particular compression\nscheme. The basic idea is to first compress the strings, and then to compute\nthe edit distance between the compressed strings. As it turns out, practically\nall known o(N^2) edit-distance algorithms work, in some sense, under the same\nparadigm described above. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a\nsingle edit-distance algorithm that works for strings which are compressed\nunder any compression scheme. A rephrasing of this question is to ask whether a\nsingle algorithm can exploit the compressibility properties of strings under\nany compression method, even if each string is compressed using a different\ncompression. In this paper we set out to answer this question by using straight\nline programs. These provide a generic platform for representing many popular\ncompression schemes including the LZ-family, Run-Length Encoding, Byte-Pair\nEncoding, and dictionary methods. For two strings of total length N having\nstraight-line program representations of total size n, we present an algorithm\nrunning in O(nN log(N/n)) time for computing the edit-distance of these two\nstrings under any rational scoring function, and an O(n^{2/3}N^{4/3}) time\nalgorithm for arbitrary scoring functions.

It is shown that\nthe max-norm constrained method is minimax rate-optimal and it yields a unified\nand robust approximate recovery guarantee, with respect to the sampling\ndistributions.

We develop in this\npaper a statistical framework for a general two-colored urn model. The\nprobability to draw a ball at each step depends on the number of balls of each\ncolor and on a multidimensional parameter $\\theta$ through a function $f$,\ncalled a choice function. We introduce two estimators of $\\theta$: the maximum\nlikelihood estimator and a weighted least squares estimator which is less\nefficient, but is closer to the calibration techniques used in the applied\nliterature. In general, the model is an inhomogeneous Markov chain and this\nproperty makes the estimation of the parameter impossible on a single path,\neven if it were infinite. Therefore we assume that we observe i.i.d.\nexperiments, each of a predetermined finite length. This is coherent with the\nusual experimental set-ups. We apply the statistical framework to a real life\nexperiment: the selection of a path among pre-existing channels by an ant\ncolony. We performed experiments, which consisted of letting ants pass through\nthe branches of a fork. We consider the particular urn model proposed by J.-L.\nDeneubourg in 1990 to describe this phenomenon. We simulate this model for\nseveral parameter values in order to assess the accuracy of the MLE and the\nWLSE. Then we estimate the parameter from the experimental data and evaluate\nconfident regions with Bootstrap algorithms. The findings of this paper do not\ncontradict the biological literature, but give statistical significance to the\nvalues of the parameter found therein.\n"]}]

On radial orbits the amount of prolate rotation in\nthe merger remnants correlates strongly with the inclination of the disks and\nis well understood as due to the conservation of the angular momentum component\nof the disks along the merger axis. For non-radial orbits prolate rotation may\nstill be produced if the orbital angular momentum is initially not much larger\nthan the intrinsic angular momentum of the disks. The orbital structure of the\nremnants with significant rotation is dominated by box orbits in the center and\nlong-axis tubes in the outer parts. The frequency analysis of stellar orbits in\nthe plane perpendicular to the major axis reveals the presence of two families\nroughly corresponding to inner and outer long-axis tubes.

Surprisingly, the\nnumber of events in high activity periods are found to conform to a power-law\ndistribution at the population level, but follow an exponential distribution at\nthe individual level, which is a hallmark of absence of memory in individual\ncall activities. Such exponential distribution is also observed for the number\nof events in low activity periods. Together with the exponential distributions\nof inter-call durations within bursts and of the intervals between consecutive\nbursts, we demonstrate that the individual call activities are driven by two\nindependent Poisson processes, which can be combined within a minimal model in\nterms of a two-state first-order Markov chain giving very good agreement with\nthe empirical distributions using the parameters estimated from real data for\nabout half of the individuals in our sample. By measuring directly the\ndistributions of call rates across the population, which exhibit power-law\ntails, we explain the difference with previous population level studies,\npurporting the existence of power-law distributions, via the \"Superposition of\nDistributions\" mechanism: The superposition of many exponential distributions\nof activities with a power-law distribution of their characteristic scales\nleads to a power-law distribution of the activities at the population level.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Here we resolve this\napparent contradiction by introducing a model where a current flows in response\nto a magnetic field even without Weyl nodes. We point out that the previous\nderivation of a vanishing CME in the limit of vanishing real frequency is a\nconsequence of the assumption of periodic boundary conditions of the system. A\nmore realistic system with open boundary conditions is not subject to these\nconstraints and can have a non-vanishing CME. Consistent with recent work, we\nfound the finite frequency CME to be non-vanishing in general when there was a\nnon-vanishing Berry curvature on the Fermi surface. This does not necessitate\nhaving a topological Berry flux as in the case of a Weyl node. Finally, we\nstudy how the perturbation theory in magnetic field might be more stable in the\npresence of disorder. Using the standard diagrammatic treatment of disorder\nwithin the Born approximation, we have found that in a realistic disordered\nsystem, the chiral magnetic response is really a dynamical phenomena and\nvanishes in the DC limit.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures, 2 pages of appendix; Revised and expanded, title\n  updated"]}]

In striking contrast to their Ga-polar counterparts, the N-polar\nQWs prepared on freestanding GaN do not exhibit any detectable\nphotoluminescence. Theoretical simulations of the band profiles combined with\nresonant excitation of the QWs allow us to rule out carrier escape and\nsubsequent surface recombination as the reason for the absence of luminescence.\nTo explore the hypothesis of a high concentration of nonradiative defects at\nthe interfaces between wells and barriers, we analyze Ga- and N-polar QWs\nprepared on 6H-SiC as a function of the well width. Intense luminescence is\nobserved for both Ga- and N polar samples. As expected, the luminescence of the\nGa-polar QWs quenches and red-shifts with increasing well width due to the\nquantum confined Stark effect. In contrast, both the intensity and the energy\nof the luminescence from the N-polar samples are essentially independent of\nwell width. Transmission electron microscopy reveals that the N-polar QWs\nexhibit abrupt interfaces and homogeneous composition, excluding emission from\nIn-rich clusters as the reason for this anomalous behavior. The microscopic\norigin of the luminescence in the N-polar QWs is elucidated using spatially\nresolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy. Regardless of well width, the\nluminescence is found to not originate from the N-polar QWs, but from the\nsemipolar facets of v-pit defects. These results cast serious doubts on the\npotential of N-polar QWs grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy for\nthe development of long-wavelength light emitting diodes. What remains to be\nseen is whether unconventional growth conditions may enable a significant\nreduction in the concentration of nonradiative defects.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures"]}]

In 3D, helicity, the integral of the\nscalar product of velocity and vorticity, is also an inviscid flow invariant\nalong with kinetic energy. Unlike enstrophy, however, helicity does not block\nthe cascade of energy to small scales. Energy and helicity are not only\nglobally conserved but also conserved within each non-linear triadic\ninteraction between three plane waves in the spectral form of the\nNavier--Stokes equation (NSE). By decomposing each plane wave into two helical\nmodes of opposite helicities each triadic interaction is split into a set of\neight triadic interactions between helical modes (Waleffe 1992).

The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate\nground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the\ninteraction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary\nnumber of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are\nlocal and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite\nnumber of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with\nrespect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by\na factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the\nnorm of local interactions in the environment.

In the\ncontext of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside\nthe code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian.

Of these Fermi pockets, two\nare pairs of topologically non-trivial electron pockets around the Weyl points\nand one is a trivial hole pocket. Unlike the other members of the\nnon-centrosymmetric monopnictides, TaAs is the first Weyl semimetal candidate\nwith the Fermi energy suffciently close to both types of Weyl points to\ngenerate chiral quasiparticles at the Fermi surface.\n"]}]

Cooler (K, M) stars\ntypically yield ages that are systematically younger than warmer (A, F, G)\nstars by a factor of two. I explore the possibility that these age\ndiscrepancies are the result of magnetic inhibition of convection in cool young\nstars by using magnetic stellar evolution isochrones to determine the age of\nthe Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. A median\nage of 10 Myr consistent across spectral types A through M is found, except for\na subset of F-type stars that appear significantly older. Agreement is shown\nfor ages derived from the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and from the empirical\nmass-radius relationship defined by eclipsing multiple-star systems.

A region in the\nHR diagram is identified that plausibly connects stars whose structures are\nweakly influenced by the presence of magnetic fields with those whose\nstructures are strongly influenced by magnetic fields. The models suggest this\nregion is characterized by stars with rapidly thinning outer convective\nenvelopes where the radiative core mass is greater than 75% of the total\nstellar mass. Furthermore, depletion of lithium predicted from magnetic models\nappears in better agreement with observed lithium equivalent widths than\npredictions from non-magnetic models.

We also introduce a new invariant $K_{top}^3$ which\nis a modification of the topological orbit dimension $K_{top}^2$ when$\nK_{top}^2$ is defined. As the applications of $K_{top}^3$, We prove that$\nK_{top}^3(A)=0$ if A has property $ c^*-{\\Gamma}$ and has no finite-dimensional\nrepresentations. We also give the definition of property MF-c^*-{\\Gamma}.

We find that there is net heating within two `jet\ncones' (within ~30 degrees from the axis of jet precession) where the ICM gains\nentropy by shock heating and mixing with the hot thermal gas within bubbles.\nOutside the jet cones, the ambient gas is heated by weak shocks, but not enough\nto overcome radiative cooling, therefore forming a `reduced' cooling flow.\nConsequently, the cluster core is in a process of `gentle circulation' over\nbillions of years. Within the jet cones, there is significant adiabatic cooling\nas the gas is uplifted by buoyantly rising bubbles; outside the cones, energy\nis supplied by inflow of already-heated gas from the jet cones as well as\nadiabatic compression as the gas moves toward the center. In other words, the\nfluid dynamics self-adjusts such that it compensates and transports the heat\nprovided by the AGN, and hence no fine-tuning of the heating profile of any\nprocess is necessary.

Hydrodynamics\nsimulations suggest the presence of convective boundary mixing (CBM) at the\nbottom of the thermal pulse-driven convective zone. Similarly,\nconvection-induced mixing processes are proposed for the mixing below the\nconvective envelope during third dredge-up where the 13C pocket for the s\nprocess in AGB stars forms. In this work we apply a CBM model motivated by\nsimulations and theory to models with initial mass $M = 2$ and $M = 3M_\\odot$,\nand with initial metal content Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02. As reported previously,\nthe He-intershell abundance of 12C and 16O are increased by CBM at the bottom\nof pulse-driven convection zone.

Aims: We aim to trace the chemical evolution of the\nGalactic disk through the inspection of the [X/Fe]-age relations of 24 species\nfrom C to Eu. Methods: Using high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise UVES\nspectra of nine solar twins, we obtained precise estimates of stellar ages and\nchemical abundances. These determinations have been integrated with additional\naccurate age and abundance determinations from recent spectroscopic studies of\nsolar twins existing in the literature, comprising superb abundances with\n0.01~dex precision. Based on this data set, we outlined the [X/Fe]-age\nrelations over a time interval of 10~Gyr. Results: We present the [X/Fe] - age\nrelations for 24 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,\nCo, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu). Each different class of elements\nshowed distinct evolution with time that relies on the different\ncharacteristics, rates and timescales of the nucleosynthesis' sites from which\nthey are produced. The $\\alpha$-elements are characterised by a [X/Fe]\ndecrement as time goes on. Strikingly, an opposite behaviour is observed for\nCa. The iron-peak elements show an early [X/Fe] increase followed by a decrease\ntowards the youngest stars. The [X/Fe] for the n-capture elements decrease with\nage. We also found that both [Mg/Y] and [Al/Y] are precise stellar clocks, with\n[Al/Y] showing the steepest dependence with age. Conslusions: Knowledge of the\n[X/Fe]-age relations is a gold mine from which we can achieve a great\nunderstanding about the processes that governed the formation and evolution of\nthe Milky Way. Through the reverse engineering of these relations we will be\nable to put strong constraints on the nature of the stellar formation history,\nthe SNe rates, the stellar yields, and the variety of the SNe progenitors.\n","Comment: The paper has been accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

Fast rotating red giants in the upper part of the red giant branch\nhave surface velocities that cannot be explained by single star evolution.\n  Aims. We check whether tides between a star and a planet followed by planet\nengulfment can indeed accelerate the surface rotation of red giants for a\nsufficient long time in order to produce these fast rotating red giants.\n  Methods. Using rotating stellar models, accounting for the redistribution of\nthe angular momentum inside the star by different transport mechanisms, for the\nexchanges of angular momentum between the planet orbit and the star before the\nengulfment and for the deposition of angular momentum inside the star at the\nengulfment, we study how the surface rotation velocity at the stellar surface\nevolves.\n  Results. We show that the surface velocities reached at the end of the\norbital decay due to tidal forces and planet engulfment can be similar to\nvalues observed for fast rotating red giants. This surface velocity then\ndecreases when the star evolves along the red giant branch but at a\nsufficiently slow pace for allowing stars to be detected with such a high\nvelocity.

In both\nregimes, inelastic scattering induced by the ac drive can excite quasi-bound\nstates in the channel that leads to resonance promotion of higher order\nsidebands. Already for weak to intermediate ac drive strength, this leads to a\nsubstantial change in the direct current between source and drain. For strong\nac drive with frequency $\\Omega$, we compute the higher harmonics of\nfrequencies $n\\Omega$ ($n$ integer) in the source-drain conductance. In regime\n(ii), we show that particular harmonics (for instance $n=6$) can be selectively\nenhanced by tuning the doping level in the channel or by tuning the drive\nstrength. We propose that the device operated in the weak-drive regime can be\nused to detect THz radiation, while in the strong-drive regime it can be used\nas a frequency multiplier.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 13 figures"]}]

Gamma Doradus stars (hereafter gamma Dor stars) are known to exhibit\ngravity- and/or gravito-intertial modes that probe the inner stellar region\nnear the convective core boundary. The non-equidistant spacing of the pulsation\nperiods is an observational signature of the stars' evolution and current\ninternal structure and is heavily influenced by rotation.\n  AIMS. We aim to constrain the near-core rotation rates for a sample of gamma\nDor stars, for which we have detected period spacing patterns.\n  METHODS. We combined the asymptotic period spacing with the traditional\napproximation of stellar pulsation to fit the observed period spacing patterns\nusing chi-squared optimisation. The method was applied to the observed period\nspacing patterns of a sample of stars and used for ensemble modelling.\n  RESULTS. For the majority of stars with an observed period spacing pattern we\nsuccessfully determined the rotation rates and the asymptotic period spacing\nvalues, though the uncertainty margins on the latter were typically large. This\nalso resulted directly in the identification of the modes corresponding with\nthe detected pulsation frequencies, which for most stars were prograde dipole\ngravity and gravito-inertial modes. The majority of the observed retrograde\nmodes were found to be Rossby modes. We further discuss the limitations of the\nmethod due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and the incomplete treatment\nof the Coriolis force.\n  CONCLUSION. Despite its current limitations, the proposed methodology was\nsuccessful to derive the rotation rates and to identify the modes from the\nobserved period spacing patterns. It forms the first step towards detailed\nseismic modelling based on observed period spacing patterns of moderately to\nrapidly rotating gamma Dor stars.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables.

Methods. From the disk model directly based\non the observations (here divided into the thin and thick stellar disks and the\nHI and H$_2$ disks subcomponents), we produce fitted mass models by combining\nthree Miyamoto-Nagai disk profiles of any \"model order\" (1, 2, or 3) for each\ndisk subcomponent.

DSO shows a\nnear-infrared excess of K_s-L' > 3 that remains compact close to the pericenter\nof its orbit.

The significantly high\nmeasured polarization degree indicates that it has a non-spherical geometry and\nit can be modelled as a combination of a bow shock with a bipolar wind of the\nstar. We use a 3D radiative transfer model that can reproduce the observed\nproperties of the source such as the total flux density and the polarization\ndegree. We obtain that the change of the polarization angle can be due to an\nintrinsic change in the source structure. Accretion disc precession of the\nyoung star in the gravitational field of the black hole can lead to the change\nof the bipolar outflow and therefore the polarization angle variation.

Our results demonstrate that the time-dependent flux and\npolarization signatures are generally dominated by the relation between the\nsynchrotron cooling and the light crossing time scale, which is largely\nindependent of the exact model parameters. We find that unlike the low-energy\npolarization signatures, which can vary rapidly in time, the high-energy\npolarization signatures appear stable. As a result, future high-energy\npolarimeters may be able to distinguish such signatures from the lower and more\nrapidly variable polarization signatures expected in leptonic models.\n","Comment: Accepted for Publication in The Astrophysical Journal"]}]

Red-giant stars may engulf planets. This may increase the rotation\nrate of their convective envelope, which could lead to strong dynamo-triggered\nmagnetic fields. Aims. We explore the possibility of generating magnetic fields\nin red giants that have gone through the process of a planet engulfment. We\ncompare them with similar models that evolve without any planets. We discuss\nthe impact of stellar wind magnetic braking on the evolution of the surface\nvelocity of the parent star. Methods. With rotating stellar models with and\nwithout planets and an empirical relation between the Rossby number and the\nsurface magnetic field, we deduce the evolution of the surface magnetic field\nalong the red-giant branch. The effects of wind magnetic braking is explored\nusing a relation deduced from MHD simulations. Results. The stellar evolution\nmodel of a 1.7 M$_\\odot$ without planet engulfment and that has a time-averaged\nrotation velocity during the Main-Sequence equal to 100 km s$^{-1}$, shows a\nsurface magnetic field triggered by convection larger than 10 G only at the\nbase of the red giant branch, that means for gravities log $g > 3$. When a\nplanet engulfment occurs, such magnetic field can also appear at much lower\ngravities, i.e. at much higher luminosities along the red giant branch.\nTypically the engulfment of a 15 M$_J$ planet produces a dynamo triggered\nmagnetic field larger than 10 G for gravities between 2.5 and 1.9. We show that\nfor reasonable wind magnetic braking laws, the high surface velocity reached\nafter a planet engulfment may be maintained sufficiently long for being\nobservable. Conclusions. High surface magnetic fields for red giants in the\nupper part of the red giant branch is a strong indication of a planet\nengulfment or of an interaction with a companion.

This observation challenges the conventional notion of\ntopologically-protected surface states, and will provoke new studies as to the\nfundamental nature of topological phase of matter in the presence of disorder.\n","Comment: Accepted in PRB"]}]

Explaining the accelerated expansion of the Universe is one of the\nfundamental challenges in physics today. Cosmography provides information about\nthe evolution of the universe derived from measured distances, assuming only\nthat the space time ge- ometry is described by the\nFriedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, and adopting an approach that\neffectively uses only Taylor expansions of basic observables. Aims. We perform\na high-redshift analysis to constrain the cosmographic expansion up to the\nfifth order. It is based on the Union2 type Ia supernovae data set, the\ngamma-ray burst Hubble diagram, a data set of 28 independent measurements of\nthe Hubble param- eter, baryon acoustic oscillations measurements from galaxy\nclustering and the Lyman-{\\alpha} forest in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and some Gaussian priors on h and {\\Omega}M .\nMethods. We performed a statistical analysis and explored the probability\ndistributions of the cosmographic parameters.

Our high-redshift analysis confirms that the expansion\nof the Universe currently accelerates; the estimation of the jerk parameter\nindicates a possible deviation from the standard {\\Lambda}CDM cosmological\nmodel. Moreover, we investigate implications of our results for the\nreconstruction of the dark energy equation of state (EOS) by comparing the\nstandard technique of cosmography with an alternative approach based on\ngeneralized Pad\\'e approximations of the same observables.

We perform a systematic analysis to find the right kind of PGT that\nneeds to be added along with the GT for training a CNN. In this regard, we\nexplore three aspects of PGT which influence the learning of a CNN: i) the PGT\nlabeling has to be of good quality; ii) the PGT images have to be different\ncompared to the GT images; iii) the PGT has to be trusted differently than GT.\nWe conclude that PGT which is diverse from GT images and has good quality of\nlabeling can indeed help improve the performance of a CNN. Also, when PGT is\nmultiple folds larger than GT, weighing down the trust on PGT helps in\nimproving the accuracy. Finally, We show that using PGT along with GT, the\nperformance of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) on Camvid data is increased by\n$2.7\\%$ on IoU accuracy.

A key challenge is the design of the PNC mapping\nand decoding mechanisms in NCMA when different users adopt different\nmodulations. While there have been past work on non-channel-coded rate-diverse\nPNC, this paper is the first attempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC\nto ensure the reliability of the overall NCMA system. Specifically, we put\nforth a symbol-splitting channel coding and modulation design so that PNC/NCMA\ncan work over different modulations. We implemented our rate-diverse NCMA\nsystem on software-defined radios. Experimental results show that the\nthroughput of rate-diverse NCMA can outperform the state-of-the-art\nrate-homogeneous NCMA by 80%. Overall, the introduction of rate diversity\nsignificantly boosts the NCMA system throughput in practical scenarios.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

Using these devices, whose high quality is demonstrated by a record\nhigh electron FET mobility of 1,100 cm$^2$/Vs at 4K, we can induce hole\ntransport at the surface of the material and determine quantitatively the\nsmallest band gap present in the material, irrespective of its direct or\nindirect nature.

Nevertheless, contrary to\nthe case of more commonly studied semiconducting TMDs (e.g., MoS$_2$, WS$_2$,\netc.) in their bulk form, we also find that ReS$_2$ FETs fabricated on bulk\ncrystals do exhibit electroluminescence when driven in the ambipolar injection\nregime, likely because the difference between the direct and indirect gap is\nonly 100 meV.

This central\nproblem of functional data analysis is well known to be ill-posed, thus\nrequiring a regularised estimation procedure. The two most commonly used\napproaches are based on spectral truncation or Tikhonov regularisation of the\nempirical covariance operator. In principle, Tikhonov regularisation is the\nmore canonical choice. Compared to spectral truncation, it is robust to\neigenvalue ties, while it attains the optimal minimax rate of convergence in\nthe mean squared sense, and not just in a concentration probability sense. In\nthis paper, we show that, surprisingly, one can strictly improve upon the\nperformance of the Tikhonov estimator in finite samples by means of a linear\nestimator, while retaining its stability and asymptotic properties by combining\nit with a form of spectral truncation. Specifically, we construct an estimator\nthat additively decomposes the functional covariate by projecting it onto two\northogonal subspaces defined via functional PCA; it then applies Tikhonov\nregularisation to the one component, while leaving the other component\nunregularised. We prove that when the covariate is Gaussian, this hybrid\nestimator uniformly improves upon the MSE of the Tikhonov estimator in a\nnon-asymptotic sense, effectively rendering it inadmissible. This domination is\nshown to also persist under discrete observation of the covariate function. The\nhybrid estimator is linear, straightforward to construct in practice, and with\nno computational overhead relative to the standard regularisation methods.

For this reason, the\ntime dilation and retardation, the contraction of the length along and the\nspatial invariance across the direction of relative motion of two frames are\npresented in a coordinate-free manner.

The key idea is to (1) capture the desired testing\nobjective via a representing function and (2) transform the automated testing\nproblem to the minimization problem of the representing function. The\nminimization problem is to be solved via mathematical optimization. The main\nfeature of ME is that it directs input space exploration by only executing the\nrepresenting function, thus avoiding static or symbolic reasoning about the\nprogram semantics, which is particularly challenging for numerical code. To\nillustrate this feature, we develop an ME-based algorithm for coverage-based\ntesting of numerical code. We also show the potential of applying and adapting\nME to other related problems, including path reachability testing, boundary\nvalue analysis, and satisfiability checking.\n  To demonstrate ME's practical benefits, we have implemented CoverMe, a\nproof-of-concept realization for branch coverage based testing, and evaluated\nit on Sun's C math library (used in, for example, Android, Matlab, Java and\nJavaScript). We have compared CoverMe with random testing and Austin, a\npublicly available branch coverage based testing tool that supports numerical\ncode (Austin combines symbolic execution and search-based heuristics). Our\nexperimental results show that CoverMe achieves near-optimal and substantially\nhigher coverage ratios than random testing on all tested programs, across all\nevaluated coverage metrics. Compared with Austin, CoverMe improves branch\ncoverage from 43% to 91%, with significantly less time (6.9 vs. 6058.4 seconds\non average).\n"]}]

In this theory, the state of a system of particles is defined by\nthe actual positions of the particles and the wave function of the system; and\nthe state of the system evolves deterministically. Thus, the Bohmian state can\nbe compared with the state in classical mechanics, which is given by the\npositions and momenta of all the particles, and which also evolves\ndeterministically. However, while in classical mechanics it is usually taken\nfor granted and considered unproblematic that the state is, at least in\nprinciple, measurable, this is not the case in Bohmian mechanics. Due to the\nlinearity of the quantum dynamical laws, one essential component of the Bohmian\nstate, the wave function, is not directly measurable. Moreover, it turns out\nthat the measurement of the other component of the state -the positions of the\nparticles- must be mediated by the wave function; a fact that in turn implies\nthat the positions of the particles, though measurable, are constrained by\nabsolute uncertainty. This is the key to understanding how Bohmian mechanics,\ndespite being deterministic, can account for all quantum predictions, including\nquantum randomness and uncertainty.\n","Comment: To appear in Fluctuation and Noise Letters special issue \"Quantum and\n  classical frontiers of noise\""]}]
