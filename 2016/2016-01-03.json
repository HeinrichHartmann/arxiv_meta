Owing to the kinetic nature of the LBM, the procedure we\npropose ensures to accurately couple DSMC and LBM at a larger Kn number than\nusually done in traditional hybrid DSMC-Navier-Stokes equation models. We show\nthe main steps of the mapping algorithm and illustrate details of the\nimplementation. Good agreement is found between the moments of the single\nparticle distribution function as obtained from the mapping scheme and from\nindependent LBM or DSMC simulations at the grid nodes where the coupling is\nimposed. We also show results on the application of the hybrid scheme based on\na simpler mapping scheme for plane Poiseuille flow at finite Kn number.\nPotential gains in the computational efficiency assured by the application of\nthe coupling scheme are estimated for the same flow.\n","Comment: Submitted to Journal of Computational Science"]}]
