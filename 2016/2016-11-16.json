For\nthe simple matrix factorization model, an efficient coordinate descent (CD)\nsolver has been previously proposed. However, efficient CD approaches have not\nbeen derived for more complex models.\n  In this paper, we provide a new framework for deriving efficient CD\nalgorithms for complex recommender models. We identify and introduce the\nproperty of k-separable models. We show that k-separability is a sufficient\nproperty to allow efficient optimization of implicit recommender problems with\nCD. We illustrate this framework on a variety of state-of-the-art models\nincluding factorization machines and Tucker decomposition.

These problems are often formulated as stochastic\noptimal control problems and solved using dynamic programming algorithms.\nUnfortunately, most existing algorithms that guarantee convergence to optimal\nsolutions suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the run time of the\nalgorithm grows exponentially with the dimension of the state space of the\nsystem. We propose novel dynamic programming algorithms that alleviate the\ncurse of dimensionality in problems that exhibit certain low-rank structure.\nThe proposed algorithms are based on continuous tensor decompositions recently\ndeveloped by the authors. Essentially, the algorithms represent\nhigh-dimensional functions (e.g., the value function) in a compressed format,\nand directly perform dynamic programming computations (e.g., value iteration,\npolicy iteration) in this format. Under certain technical assumptions, the new\nalgorithms guarantee convergence towards optimal solutions with arbitrary\nprecision. Furthermore, the run times of the new algorithms scale polynomially\nwith the state dimension and polynomially with the ranks of the value function.\nThis approach realizes substantial computational savings in \"compressible\"\nproblem instances, where value functions admit low-rank approximations. We\ndemonstrate the new algorithms in a wide range of problems, including a\nsimulated six-dimensional agile quadcopter maneuvering example and a\nseven-dimensional aircraft perching example.

In the period between April 1993 and July 2014, the\nbrightness of the progenitor gradually increased by 2.2 mag in the V band.

The\namplitude of the outburst was minimum among the red novae, only 5.6 mag in the\nV band. The H alpha emission line and the continuum of a cool supergiant with a\ngradually decreasing surface temperature were observed in the spectra.

In this paper, we present an algorithm\nto register and stitch multiple light fields.
