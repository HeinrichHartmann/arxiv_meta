The\nresulting linear system from compact FD discretization is solved by the\nconjugate gradient (CG) method with a relative residual stopping criterion. By\ncombining the Richardson extrapolation and tri-quartic Lagrange interpolation\nfor the numerical solutions from two-level of grids (current and previous\ngrids), we are able to produce an extremely accurate approximation of the\nactual numerical solution on the next finer grid, which can greatly reduce the\nnumber of relaxation sweeps needed. Additionally, a simple method based on the\nmidpoint extrapolation formula is used for the fourth-order FD solutions on\ntwo-level of grids to achieve sixth-order accuracy on the entire fine grid\ncheaply and directly. The gradient of the numerical solution can also be easily\nobtained through solving a series of tridiagonal linear systems resulting from\nthe fourth-order compact FD discretizations. Numerical results show that our\nEXCMG method is much more efficient than the classical V-cycle and W-cycle\nmultigrid methods. Moreover, only few CG iterations are required on the finest\ngrid to achieve full fourth-order accuracy in both the $L^2$-norm and\n$L^{\\infty}$-norm for the solution and its gradient when the exact solution\nbelongs to $C^6$. Finally, numerical result shows that our EXCMG method is\nstill effective when the exact solution has a lower regularity, which widens\nthe scope of applicability of our EXCMG method.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Journal of Scientific Computing. arXiv\n  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1506.02983"]}]
