The goal of segmentation algorithms is to accurately\nassign object labels to each image location. However, image-noise, shortcomings\nof algorithms, and image ambiguities cause uncertainty in label assignment.\nEstimating the uncertainty in label assignment is important in multiple\napplication domains, such as segmenting tumors from medical images for\nradiation treatment planning. One way to estimate these uncertainties is\nthrough the computation of posteriors of Bayesian models, which is\ncomputationally prohibitive for many practical applications. On the other hand,\nmost computationally efficient methods fail to estimate label uncertainty. We\ntherefore propose in this paper the Active Mean Fields (AMF) approach, a\ntechnique based on Bayesian modeling that uses a mean-field approximation to\nefficiently compute a segmentation and its corresponding uncertainty. Based on\na variational formulation, the resulting convex model combines any\nlabel-likelihood measure with a prior on the length of the segmentation\nboundary. A specific implementation of that model is the Chan-Vese segmentation\nmodel (CV), in which the binary segmentation task is defined by a Gaussian\nlikelihood and a prior regularizing the length of the segmentation boundary.\nFurthermore, the Euler-Lagrange equations derived from the AMF model are\nequivalent to those of the popular Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model for image\ndenoising. Solutions to the AMF model can thus be implemented by directly\nutilizing highly-efficient ROF solvers on log-likelihood ratio fields.

For monic LMIs, i.e., $A_0=I$, and nc matrix-valued polynomials\nthe certificates of positivity were established by Helton, Klep and McCollough\nin a series of articles with the use of the theory of complete positivity from\noperator algebras and classical separation arguments from real algebraic\ngeometry.

As a corollary one obtains the description of a polar dual\nof a free Hilbert spectrahedron $D_L$ and its projection, called a free Hilbert\nspectrahedrop. Using this characterization in a separation argument, we obtain\na certificate for multivariate matrix-valued nc polynomials $F$ positive\nsemidefinite on a free Hilbert spectrahedron defined by a monic LOI.

These structures are simple in the sense that no more than\nthree faces meet at an edge and no more than four edges meet at a vertex.\nIndividual cells can thus be considered (with few degenerated exceptions) as\nsimple, three-dimensional polyhedra. A question of recent interest involves\ndetermining the distribution of combinatorial types of such polyhedral cells.\nIn this paper we introduce the terms \\emph{fundamental} and\n\\emph{vertex-truncated} types and demonstrate that most grains are of\nparticular fundamental types, whereas the frequency of vertex-truncated types\ndecreases exponentially with the number of truncations. This can be explained\nby the evolutionary process through which grain growth structures are formed,\nand in which energetically unfavorable surfaces are quickly eliminated.\nFurthermore, we observe that these grain types are `round' in a combinatorial\nsense: there are no `short' separating cycles that partition the polyhedra into\ntwo parts of similar sizes. A particular microstructure derived from the\nPoisson--Voronoi initial condition is identified as containing an unusually\nlarge proportion of round grains.

Yet the accuracy of results derived in high magnification regions\nusing lensing clusters is limited due to systematics. We present a new\nforward-modeling formalism to incorporate the impact of magnification\nuncertainties into luminosity function results, by exploiting the availability\nof many independent magnification models for the same clusters. One public\nlensing model is treated as the truth and used to construct a mock set of\nlensed high-redshift galaxies, which can then be analyzed using another\nmagnification model (typically a median model) to construct a luminosity\nfunction. Using the most comprehensive and faintest selection of lensed z~6\ngalaxies to date (drawn from the first 4 HFF clusters), we derive direct\nconstraints on the shape of the UV LF to -13.5 mag and with much greater\nuncertainties to -12.5 mag. Our simulations reveal that for highly-magnified\nsources (>~30x) the systematic uncertainties become very large, reaching\nseveral orders of magnitude at 95% confidence at ~-12 mag. The volume densities\nwe derive for faint (>-17 mag) sources are ~3-4x lower than one recent report,\nwith a faint-end slope -1.92+/-0.04 (3.5-sigma shallower). Introducing a new\ncurvature parameter to model the faint end of the LF, we demonstrate that\ncurrent observations permit (within the 68% confidence intervals) a turn-over\nin the z~6 UV LF as bright as -15.3 and -14.2 mag, respectively, if differences\nbetween the full and parameterized set of lensing models in the HFF effort are\nrepresentative.

Molecular motors actively step along\nmicrotubules to shuttle cellular materials between the nucleus and the cell\nperiphery; this transport is critical for the survival and health of all\neukaryotic cells. Structural defects in microtubules exist, but whether these\ndefects impact molecular motor-based transport remains unknown. Here, we report\na new, to our knowledge, approach that allowed us to directly investigate the\nimpact of such defects. Using a modified optical-trapping method, we examined\nthe group function of a major molecular motor, conventional kinesin, when\ntransporting cargos along individual microtubules.

The effects depend on motor\nnumber: cargos driven by a few motors tended to unbind prematurely from the\nmicrotubule, whereas cargos driven by more motors tended to pause.

In a flat universe\ncomposed only of those two fluids, we consider separately two forms of\ninteraction, through terms proportional to the densities of both dark energy\nand dark matter. An analytic expression for the growth rate approximated as $f\n= \\Omega_{\\mathrm{DM}}^{\\gamma}$, where $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{DM}}$ is the\npercentage contribution from the dark matter to the content of the universe and\n$\\gamma$ is the growth index, is derived in terms of the interaction strength\nand of other parameters of the model in the first case, while for the second\nmodel we show that a non-zero interaction cannot be accommodated by the index\ngrowth approximation. The successful expressions obtained are then used to\ncompare the predictions with growth of structure observational data in a MCMC\ncode.\n  We also employ observations of galaxy clusters to assess their virial state\nvia the modified Layzer-Irvine equation in order to detect signs of an\ninteraction, obtaining measurements of observed virial ratios, interaction\nstrength, rest virial ratio and departure from equilibrium for a set of\nclusters.

Here, the\ndisintegration process and the resulting self-consistent IASWs are studied in a\nwide range of trapping parameters covering all the three regimes continuously.\nThe dependency of features such as the time of disintegration, the number,\nspeed and size of IASWs on the trapping parameter are focused upon.

Four shape descriptors, ten first-order metrics and 26\ntextural features were computed. Bland-Altman analysis was used to quantify\nrepeatability. Features were subsequently categorized as very reliable,\nreliable, moderately reliable and poorly reliable with respect to the\ncorresponding volume variability. Results: Repeatability was highly variable\namongst features. Numerous metrics were identified as poorly or moderately\nreliable.

It is therefore\nnecessary to quantify the limits within which the scaling laws would remain\napplicable for magnetocaloric research. For this purpose, a threefold approach\nhas been followed: a) the magnetocaloric responses of a set of materials with\nCurie temperatures ranging from 46 to 336 K have been modeled with a mean-field\nBrillouin model, b) experimental data for Gd has been analyzed, and c) a\n3D-Ising model ---which is beyond the mean-field approximation--- has been\nstudied.

In this range, the\npredicted deviations from scaling laws remain below the experimental error\nmargin of carefully performed experiments.
