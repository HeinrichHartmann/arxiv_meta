We therefore have developed\nthe \"black-box\" strategy for re-weighting a set of configurations generated by\narbitrary means to produce an ensemble distributed according to any target\ndistribution. In contrast to previous algorithmic efforts, the black-box\napproach exploits the configuration-space density observed in a simulation,\nrather than assuming a desired distribution has been generated. Successful\nimplementations of the strategy, which reduce both statistical error and bias,\nare developed for a one-dimensional system, and a 50-atom peptide, for which\nthe correct 250-to-1 population ratio is recovered from a heavily biased\nensemble.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures (b/w)"]}]
