Our work is motivated by\nthe recently discovered examples of thermotropic biaxial nematic liquid\ncrystals comprising bent-core mesogens, whose molecular structure is\ncharacterized by a non-polar body axis $({\\bf{n}})$ as well as a polar axis\n$({\\bf{p}})$ along the bisector of the bent mesogenic core which is coincident\nwith a large, transverse dipole moment. The free energy for this system differs\nfrom that of biaxial nematic liquid crystals in that it contains terms\nviolating the ${\\bf{p}}\\to -{\\bf{p}}$ symmetry. We show that, in spite of a\ngeneral splay instability associated with these parity-odd terms, a uniform\npolarized biaxial state can be stable in a range of parameters. We then derive\nthe hydrodynamic equations of the system, via the Poisson-bracket formalism, in\nthe polarized state and comment on the structure of the corresponding linear\nhydrodynamic modes. In our Poisson-bracket derivation, we also compute the\nflow-alignment parameters along the three symmetry axes in terms of microscopic\nparameters associated with the molecular geometry of the constituent biaxial\nmesogens.\n","Comment: 16 pages, RevTeX, 1 figure"]}]
