It is simple to implement, can be solved\nefficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms\ntraditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first\nglance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious\nto see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial\nis to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph\nLaplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral\nclustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several\ndifferent approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral\nclustering algorithms are discussed.\n"]}]
