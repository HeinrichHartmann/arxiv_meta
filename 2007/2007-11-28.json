In particular,\nthe contribution of X-ray Scattering (XRS) to the HEW of the optic is usually\nan increasing function H(E) of the photon energy E. Therefore, in future hard\nX-ray imaging telescopes of the future (SIMBOL-X, NeXT, Constellation-X, XEUS),\nthe X-ray scattering could be the dominant problem since they will operate also\nin the hard X-ray band (i.e. beyond 10 keV). [...]\n  Several methods were proposed in the past years to estimate the scattering\ncontribution to the HEW, dealing with the surface microroughness expressed in\nterms of its Power Spectral Density (PSD), on the basis of the well-established\ntheory of X-ray scattering from rough surfaces. We faced that problem on the\nbasis on the same theory, but we tried a new approach: the direct, analytical\ntranslation of a given surface roughness PSD into a H(E) trend, and - vice\nversa - the direct translation of a H(E) requirement into a surface PSD. This\nPSD represents the maximum tolerable microroughness level in order to meet the\nH(E) requirement in the energy band of a given X-ray telescope.\n  We have thereby found a new, analytical and widely applicable formalism to\ncompute the XRS contribution to the HEW from the surface PSD, provided that the\nPSD had been measured in a wide range of spatial frequencies. The inverse\nproblem was also solved, allowing the immediate evaluation of the mirror\nsurface PSD from a measured function H(E). The same formalism allows\nestablishing the maximum allowed PSD of the mirror in order to fulfill a given\nH(E) requirement.

We\ndevelop the technical machinery on which all of our results rely. In\nparticular, the linearization of addends appearing in the\nBaker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula is one of the major tools in several proofs.\nThis allows us to characterize graded group-valued continuously Pansu\ndifferentiable mappings through a system of nonlinear first order PDEs, namely,\nthe \"contact equations\". Through this approach we establish a quantitative\nestimate for the Pansu difference quotient. This key result is crucial to get\nthe mean value inequality, the inverse mapping theorem, the rank theorem and\nthe implicit function theorem for graded group-valued continuously Pansu\ndifferentiable mappings. All of these results represent the backbone to develop\na reasonable \"Calculus\" in this context. On the other hand, these theorems rise\nthe question of possible factorizations of stratified groups into inner\nsemidirect products. In fact, we consider this algebraic issue to show that\nimage-sets and level-sets of suitable continuously Pansu differentiable\nmappings are intrinsic graphs. These sets represent the intrinsic regular\nsubmanifolds modeled on a couple of fixed groups. Notice that the metric\nproperties of these sets are completely different from the ones of classical\nsubmanifolds.\n","Comment: 61 pages.
