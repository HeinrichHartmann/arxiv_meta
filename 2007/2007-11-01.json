However, it is\nnotoriously difficult to estimate the multicanonical temperature effectively.\nWang and Landau developed a convenient method for estimating the density of\nstates based on a multicanonical Monte Carlo method. In their method, the\ndensity of states is calculated autonomously during a simulation. In this paper\nwe develop a set of techniques to effectively apply the Wang-Landau method to\nMD simulations. In the multicanonical MD, the estimation of the derivative of\nthe density of states is critical. In order to estimate it accurately, we\ndevise two original improvements. First, the correction for the density of\nstates is made smooth by using the Gaussian distribution obtained by a short\ncanonical simulation. Second, an approximation is applied to the derivative,\nwhich is based on the Gaussian distribution and the multiple weighted histogram\ntechnique. A test of this method was performed with small polypeptides,\nMet-enkephalin and Trp-cage, and it is demonstrated that Wang-Landau MD is\nconsistent with replica exchange MD but can sample much larger conformational\nspace.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Physical Review E"]}]

How to reconstruct such functions from a small number of measurements?\n  The stress is on a comparison of linear and non-linear approaches. As a model\ncase we use piecewise-constant functions on [0,1], in particular, the Heaviside\njump function. Considered as a curve in the Hilbert space, it is completely\ncharacterized by the fact that any two its disjoint chords are orthogonal. We\nreinterpret this fact in a context of step-functions in one or two variables.\n  Next we study the limitations on representability and reconstruction of\npiecewise-constant functions by linear and semi-linear methods. Our main tools\nin this problem are Kolmogorov's n-width and entropy, as well as Temlyakov's\n(N,m)-width.\n  On the positive side, we show that a very accurate non-linear reconstruction\nis possible. It goes through a solution of certain specific non-linear systems\nof algebraic equations. We discuss the form of these systems and methods of\ntheir solution, stressing their relation to Moment Theory and Complex Analysis.\n  Finally, we informally discuss two problems in Computer Imaging which are\nparallel to the problems 1 and 2 above: compression of still images and\nvideo-sequences on one side, and image reconstruction from indirect measurement\n(for example, in Computer Tomography), on the other.\n","Comment: Major revision, added chapters 4, 5. 34 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Symmetry breaking is primarily a\nconsequence of the fact that the rates of reactions involving homodimers and\nheterodimers are different, i.e., stereoselective, and on the fact that\nepimerization can only occur on the N-terminal residue and not on the Cterminal\nresidue.
