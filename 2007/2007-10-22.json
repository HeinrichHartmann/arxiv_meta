In the present\npaper it is proved, in a constructive way, that a Lyapounov variable can be\nfound within the standard Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics and,\nhence, the MPC assumptions are more restrictive than necessary for the\nconstruction of such a quantity. Moreover, as in the MPC theory, the existence\nof a Lyapounov variable implies the existence of a transformation mapping the\noriginal quantum mechanical problem to an equivalent irreversible\nrepresentation.

In the last year, I proposed the mirrored version of EGR, the\nflat-spacetime general relativity (FGR), in which particles move along curved\nlines on flat spacetime. This puts gravitational study back to the traditional\nLagrangian formulation. In fact, all claimed accurate verification of general\nrelativity is the verification of FGR, because people when confronting GR to\nobservational data, calculate time, distance, or angle by directly using the\ncoordinates in Schwarzschild solution or in post Newtonian formulation. For\nexample, people calculate the angles by directly using the coordinate $\\phi$.\nHowever, only when spacetime is flat does there exists one coordinate system\nwhich has direct meaning of time, distance, angle, and vice verse. This is the\nfamous Riemann theorem.
