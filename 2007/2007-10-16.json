Given a Lie group action that generates transport\nalong the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie\ngroup via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding\nLie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group\nintegrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary\ndifferential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are\nuniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.\nLastly we demonstrate our methods by simulating the dynamics of a free rigid\nbody such as a satellite and an autonomous underwater vehicle both perturbed by\ntwo independent multiplicative stochastic noise processes.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 4 figures"]}]

That process suggested as a way to achieve resurrection of\nhuman consciousness. Mind uploading can be seen as a migration process of the\ncore mental functions, which migrate from a human brain to an artificial\nenvironment. To simulate the process, I suggest a topological approach which is\nbased on a formalism of information geometry. Geometrical formalism lets us\nsimulate the toy mind as geometrical structures as well as gives us powerful\ngeometrical and topological methods for analysis of the information system.\nThis approach leads to the insight about using holographic model as an analogy\nfor the mind migration to an artificial environment. This model represents the\ntoy mind functionality in terms of information geometry (as a geometrical\nshape) on information manifold. Such shape can have distributed holographic\nrepresentation. This representation gives us delocalized representation of the\nsystem. At the same time, the process of creating the holographic\nrepresentation gives us a strategy to migrate from original to an artificial\nenvironment and back. The interface between brain and an environment is modeled\nas an entropy flow which is defined as a geometrical flow on information\nmanifold. Such flow is an analogy of holography recording for the toy mind. The\nopposite process of holography reconstruction is modeled by none-local\nHamiltonians defined on the information manifold.\n","Comment: 8 figures, submitted to conference Toward a Science of Consciousness\n  2008 April 8-12, 2008"]}]

Expressions to determine the poloidal variations of\ndensity, poloidal velocity, toroidal velocity, radial electric field, poloidal\nelectric field, and other radial profiles are presented in a multi-species\nsetting. Using as input experimental data for the flux surface averaged\nprofiles of density, temperature, toroidal current, toroidal momentum\ninjection, and the poloidal and toroidal rotations of at least one species of\nion, one may solve the equations numerically for the remaining profiles. The\nresultant effective viscosities are compared to those predicted by Stacey and\nSigmar and Shaing, et al., [Nuclear Fusion, 25, 4 (1985)]. A velocity\ndependence of the effective viscosity is observed, indicating the presence of\nnon-Newtonian fluid behavior in magnetized plasma.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 8 figures, as submitted to Physics of Plasmas"]}]
