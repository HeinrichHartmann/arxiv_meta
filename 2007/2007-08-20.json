The accuracy of the\nnew bound is then examined for two sequential decoding algorithms, an\nordering-free variant of the generalized Dijkstra's algorithm (GDA)(or\nsimplified GDA) and the maximum-likelihood sequential decoding algorithm\n(MLSDA). Empirically investigating codes of small blocklength reveals that the\ntheoretical upper bound for the simplified GDA almost matches the simulation\nresults as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per information bit ($\\gamma_b$) is\ngreater than or equal to 8 dB. However, the theoretical bound may become\nmarkedly higher than the simulated average complexity when $\\gamma_b$ is small.\nFor the MLSDA, the theoretical upper bound is quite close to the simulation\nresults for both high SNR ($\\gamma_b\\geq 6$ dB) and low SNR ($\\gamma_b\\leq 2$\ndB). Even for moderate SNR, the simulation results and the theoretical bound\ndiffer by at most \\makeblue{0.8} on a $\\log_{10}$ scale.\n","Comment: Submitted to the IEEE Trans. on Information Theory, 30 pages, 9\n  figures"]}]
