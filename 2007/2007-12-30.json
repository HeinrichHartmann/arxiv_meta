Aligning\nadaptive optics Altair/NIRI imaging of SN 2007gr from the Gemini (North)\nTelescope with the pre-explosion HST WFPC2 images, we identify the SN position\non the HST frames with an accuracy of 20 mas. Although nothing is detected at\nthe SN position we show that it lies on the edge of a bright source, 134+/-23\nmas (6.9 pc) from its nominal centre. Based on its luminosity we suggest that\nthis object is possibly an unresolved, compact and coeval cluster and that the\nSN progenitor was a cluster member, although we note that model profile fitting\nfavours a single bright star. We find two solutions for the age of this assumed\ncluster; 7-/+0.5 Myrs and 20-30 Myrs, with turn-off masses of 28+/-4 Msun and\n12-9 Msun respectively. Pre-explosion ground-based K-band images marginally\nfavour the younger cluster age/higher turn-off mass. Assuming the SN progenitor\nwas a cluster member, the turn-off mass provides the best estimate for its\ninitial mass. More detailed observations, after the SN has faded, should\ndetermine if the progenitor was indeed part of a cluster, and if so allow an\nage estimate to within ~2 Myrs thereby favouring either a high mass single star\nor lower mass interacting binary progenitor.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, resolution of fig 1. has been reduced, some\n  revision based on referee's comments, Accepted ApJL 27 Nov 2007"]}]
