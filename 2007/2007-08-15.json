The system is numerically\ninvestigated from both global and local points of view using a characteristic\nslicing and radial compactification. We find that the critical exponent that\ncharacterizes the discretely self-similar solution can be extracted both\nlocally, in the self-similar region and globally, e.g. from the news function.\nIn this sense, self-similarity is observable from future null infinity. For\nsubcritical evolutions we have numerically analyzed the exponents of power-law\ntails and have found agreement with analytical calculations for radiation along\nnull infinity and along timelike lines. We argue that for astrophysical\nobservers the relevant falloff rate is that of future null infinity. We have\nalso investigated the behavior of quasinormal modes (QNM) in near-critical\nevolutions.
