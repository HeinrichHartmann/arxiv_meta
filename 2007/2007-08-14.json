A new notion of\nweak solutions, called moment solutions, is introduced for second order fully\nnonlinear PDEs. Unlike viscosity solutions, moment solutions are defined by a\nconstructive method, called vanishing moment method, hence, they can be readily\ncomputed by existing numerical methods such as finite difference, finite\nelement, spectral Galerkin, and discontinuous Galerkin methods with\n\"guaranteed\" convergence. The main idea of the proposed vanishing moment method\nis to approximate a second order fully nonlinear PDE by a higher order, in\nparticular, a fourth order quasilinear PDE.
