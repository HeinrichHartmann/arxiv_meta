Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%.

This latter\nproperty allows the heavy tailedness of the log returns of the stock prices to\nbe also accounted for in addition to the long range dependence introduced by\nthe fractional Brownian motion. Work has been done previously on this problem\nfor the case with constant `volatility' and without a time change; here these\nresults are extended to the case of stochastic volatility models when the\nmodulator is fractional Brownian motion or a time change of it. (Volatility in\nfractional Black-Scholes models does not carry the same meaning as in the\nclassic Black-Scholes framework, which is made clear in the text.)\n  Since fractional Brownian motion is not a semi-martingale, the Black-Scholes\ndifferential equation is not well-defined sense for arbitrary predictable\nvolatility processes. However, it is shown here that any almost surely\ncontinuous and adapted process having zero quadratic variation can act as an\nintegrator over functions of the integrator and over the family of continuous\nadapted semi-martingales. Moreover it is shown that the integral also has zero\nquadratic variation, and therefore that the integral itself can be an\nintegrator. This property of the integral is crucial in developing the\narbitrage strategy. Since fractional Brownian motion and a time change of\nfractional Brownian motion have zero quadratic variation, these results are\napplicable to these cases in particular.

Through the use of spreading\nsequences, the processing gain of Random CDMA systems (RCDMA), is devoted to\nboth bandwidth expansion and orthogonalization of the signals transmitted by\ndifferent users. Another type of multiple access system is Impulse Radio (IR).\nIn many aspects, IR systems are similar to time division multiple access (TDMA)\nsystems, and the processing gain of IR systems represents the ratio between the\nactual transmission time and the total time between two consecutive\nransmissions (on-plus-off to on ratio). While CDMA systems, which constantly\nexcite the channel, rely on spreading sequences to orthogonalize the signals\ntransmitted by different users, IR systems transmit a series of short pulses\nand the orthogonalization between the signals transmitted by different users is\nachieved by the fact that most of the pulses do not collide with each other at\nthe receiver.\n  In this paper, a general class of MA communication systems that use both\ntypes of processing gain is presented, and both IR and RCDMA systems are\ndemonstrated to be two special cases of this more general class of systems. The\nbit error rate (BER) of several receivers as a function of the ratio between\nthe two types of processing gain is analyzed and compared under the constraint\nthat the total processing gain of the system is large and fixed.

Previous approaches assumed a threshold-based link\nlayer model in which a packet transmission is successful if the SINR at the\nreceiver is greater than a fixed threshold. In reality, the mapping from SINR\nto packet success probability is continuous. Hence, over each hop, for every\nfinite SINR, there is a non-zero probability of packet loss. With this more\nrealistic link model, it is shown that for a broad class of routing and\nscheduling schemes, a fixed fraction of hops on each route have a fixed\nnon-zero packet loss probability. In a large network, a packet travels an\nasymptotically large number of hops from source to destination. Consequently,\nit is shown that the cumulative effect of per-hop packet loss results in a\nper-node throughput of only O(1/n) (instead of Theta(1/sqrt{n log{n}})) as\nshown previously for the threshold-based link model).\n  A scheduling scheme is then proposed to counter this effect. The proposed\nscheme improves the link SINR by using conservative spatial reuse, and improves\nthe per-node throughput to O(1/(K_n sqrt{n log{n}})), where each cell gets a\ntransmission opportunity at least once every K_n slots, and K_n tends to\ninfinity as n tends to infinity.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory, April 21st 2005"]}]

We\nconsider three classes of scheduling algorithms with progressively increasing\ncomplexity. The first class strives for minimum complexity by resorting to a\nstatic scheduling strategy along with memoryless decoding. Our analysis for\nthis class of scheduling algorithms reveals the existence of a static\nscheduling policy that achieves the optimal scaling law of the throughput at\nthe expense of a delay that increases exponentially with the number of users.\nThe second scheduling policy resorts to a higher complexity incremental\nredundancy encoding/decoding strategy to achieve a superior throughput-delay\ntradeoff. The third, and most complex, scheduling strategy benefits from the\ncooperation between the different users to minimize the delay while achieving\nthe optimal scaling law of the throughput. In particular, the proposed\ncooperative multicast strategy is shown to simultaneously achieve the optimal\nscaling laws of both throughput and delay. Then, we generalize our scheduling\nalgorithms to exploit the multi-group diversity available when different\ninformation streams are requested by different subsets of the user population.\nFinally, we discuss the effect of the potential gains of equipping the base\nstation with multi-transmit antennas and present simulation results that\nvalidate our theoretical claims.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to the joint special issue of\n  Transactions on Information Theory and Transactions on Networking"]}]

In order to quantify LP decoding, and thus to describe\nperformance of the error-correction scheme at moderate and large\nSignal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNR), it is important to study the relaxed polytope to\nunderstand better its vertexes, so-called pseudo-codewords, especially those\nwhich are neighbors of the zero codeword. In this manuscript we propose a\ntechnique to heuristically create a list of these neighbors and their\ndistances. Our pseudo-codeword-search algorithm starts by randomly choosing the\ninitial configuration of the noise. The configuration is modified through a\ndiscrete number of steps. Each step consists of two sub-steps. Firstly, one\napplies an LP decoder to the noise-configuration deriving a pseudo-codeword.\nSecondly, one finds configuration of the noise equidistant from the pseudo\ncodeword and the zero codeword. The resulting noise configuration is used as an\nentry for the next step. The iterations converge rapidly to a pseudo-codeword\nneighboring the zero codeword. Repeated many times, this procedure is\ncharacterized by the distribution function (frequency spectrum) of the\npseudo-codeword effective distance. The effective distance of the coding scheme\nis approximated by the shortest distance pseudo-codeword in the spectrum.

The main results are that under weak\nassumptions the maximum achievable single user DLC is almost independent of the\ndistribution of the path attenuations in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region\nbut depends strongly on the delay spread. In the high SNR region the roles are\nexchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while the impact of\nthe distribution becomes dominant.
