Different approaches have been devised to cure this problem for\nsuperconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at\noptimal working points, so-called \"sweet spots.\" This latter approach led to\nsignificant improvement of $T_2$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et\nal., Science 296, 886 (2002)]. Here, we introduce a new type of superconducting\nqubit called the \"transmon.\" Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed\nto operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and\ncharging energy $E_J/E_C$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge\ndispersion decreases exponentially with $E_J/E_C$, while its loss in\nanharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a\ndrastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair\nbox and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient\nanharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full\nsystem shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other\nknown channels.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 12 figures; title changed, small changes in the text,\n  additional figure"]}]

The problem consists of\ndetermining, in dimension three, the shape of an axis-symmetric body, with\nassigned radius and height, which offers minimum resistance when it is moving\nin a resistant medium. The problem has a very rich history and is well\ndocumented in the literature. Of course, at first glance, one suspects that the\ntwo dimensional case should be well known. Nevertheless, we have looked into\nnumerous references and ask at least as many experts on the problem, and we\nhave not been able to identify a single source.

Novelties include: (i) while in the classical\nthree-dimensional problem only the restricted case makes sense (without\nrestriction on the monotonicity of admissible functions the problem doesn't\nadmit a local minimum), we prove that in dimension two the unrestricted problem\nis also well-posed when the ratio height versus radius of base is greater than\na given quantity; (ii) while in three dimensions the (restricted) problem has a\nunique solution, we show that in the restricted two-dimensional problem the\nminimizer is not always unique - when the height of the body is less or equal\nthan its base radius, there exists infinitely many minimizing functions.\n","Comment: Presented at the 4th Junior European Meeting on \"Control and\n  Optimization\", Institute of Mathematics and Physics, Bialystok Technical\n  University, Bialystok, Poland, 11-14 September 2005.
