This\nis in contrast to the assumption of hole doping into planar Cu dx2-y2 and O\npsigma orbitals as in the t-J model. Interaction of holes with the d9 spin\nbackground leads to chiral polarons with either a clockwise or anti-clockwise\ncharge current. When the polaron plaquettes percolate through the crystal at\nx~0.05 for LaSrCuO, a Cu dx2-y2 and planar O psigma band is formed. Spin\nexchange Coulomb repulsion with chiral polarons leads to D-wave\nsuperconductivity. The equivalent of the Debye energy in phonon\nsuperconductivity is the maximum energy separation between a chiral polaron and\nits time-reversed partner. An additive skew-scattering contribution to the Hall\neffect is induced by chiral polarons and leads to a temperature dependent Hall\neffect that fits the measured values for LaSrCuO. The integrated imaginary\nsusceptibility satisfies omega/T scaling due to chirality and spin-flip\nscattering of polarons along with a uniform distribution of polaron energy\nsplittings. The derived functional form is compatible with experiments. The\nstatic spin structure factor is computed and is incommensurate with a\nseparation distance from (pi,pi) given by ~(2pi)x.

While\nusual methods to find spatial patterns, such as Principal Components Analysis\n(PCA), are constrained by linear symmetries, the dependence of variables such\nas temperature or pressure at different locations is generally nonlinear. In\nparticular, large deviations from the sample mean are expected to be strongly\naffected by such nonlinearities.

In order to test the\ntechnique and to introduce the methodology, we focus on the El Nino/Southern\nOscillation and its spatial patterns. We find nonsymmetric temperature patterns\ncorresponding to El Nino and La Nina, and we compare the results of MCF with\nother techniques, such as the symmetric solutions of PCA, and the nonsymmetric\nsolutions of Nonlinear PCA (NLPCA). We found that MCF solutions are more\nreliable than the NLPCA fits, and can capture mixtures of principal components.\nFinally, we apply Extreme Value Theory on the temporal variations extracted\nfrom our methodology. We find that the tails of the distribution of extreme\ntemperatures during La Nina episodes is bounded, while the tail during El Ninos\nis less likely to be bounded.

In this\nwork we study the effect of magnetic surface flux distribution on the coronal\nfield topology and angular momentum loss rate. We investigate if magnetic flux\nconcentration towards the pole is a reasonable alternative to dynamo\nsaturation. We construct a 1D wind model and also apply a 2-D self-similar\nanalytical model, to evaluate how the surface field distribution affects the\nangular momentum loss of the rotating star. From the 1D model we find that, in\na magnetically dominated low corona, the concentrated polar surface field\nrapidly expands to regions of low magnetic pressure resulting in a coronal\nfield with small latitudinal variation. We also find that the angular momentum\nloss rate due to a uniform field or a concentrated field with equal total\nmagnetic flux is very similar. From the 2D wind model we show that there are\nseveral relevant factors to take into account when studying the angular\nmomentum loss from a star. In particular, we show that the inclusion of force\nbalance across the field in a wind model is fundamental if realistic\nconclusions are to be drawn from the effect of non-uniform surface field\ndistribution on magnetic braking. This model predicts that a magnetic field\nconcentrated at high latitudes leads to larger Alfven radii and larger braking\nrates than a smoother field distribution.
