This demonstrates the\ncomplexity of the network synchronizability problem. For a given network with\nidentical node dynamics, it is further shown that two key factors influencing\nthe network synchronizability are the network inner linking matrix and the\neigenvalues of the network topological matrix. Several examples are then\nprovided to show that adding new edges to a network can either increase or\ndecrease the network synchronizability. In searching for conditions under which\nthe network synchronizability may be increased by adding edges, it is found\nthat for networks with disconnected complementary graphs, adding edges never\ndecreases their synchronizability. This implies that better understanding and\ncareful manipulation of the complementary graphs are important and useful for\nenhancing the network synchronizability. Moreover, it is found that an\nunbounded synchronized region is always easier to analyze than a bounded\nsynchronized region. Therefore, to effectively enhance the network\nsynchronizability, a design method is finally presented for the inner linking\nmatrix of rank 1 such that the resultant network has an unbounded synchronized\nregion, for the case where the synchronous state is an equilibrium point of the\nnetwork.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures"]}]

The problem is that\nthe deployment process is composed of many heterogeneous tasks that have to be\norchestrated in a specific correct order.

On a crayfish scale chemical stimuli received from a distant\nsource are dispersed by an ambient flow rather than molecular diffusion. When\nthe flow is weak or absent, food search can be facilitated by currents\ngenerated by the animal itself. Crayfish employ their anterior fan organs to\nproduce a variety of flow patterns. Here we study the flow generated by\nProcambarus clarkii in response to odour stimulation. We found that while\nsearching for food the crayfish generates one or two outward jets. These jets\ncreate an inflow which draws odour to the crayfish's anterior chemoreceptors.\nWe quantified velocity fields in the inflow region using Particle Image\nVelocimetry. The results show that the inflow velocity decreases proportionally\nto the inverse distance from the animal so that it takes about a minute for an\nodour plume to reach the animal's chemoreceptors from a distance of 10 cm. We\ncompare the inflow generated by live crayfish with that produced by a mimicking\ndevice, a phantom. The phantom consisted of two nozzles and an inlet providing\ntwo jets and a sink so that the overall mass flux was zero. The use of a\nphantom enabled us to analyze the inflow at various jet parameters.
