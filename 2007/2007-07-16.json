Several recent papers refer to this parameter as the \\emph{stopping\ndistance} $s$ of $C$. This is somewhat of a misnomer since the size of the\nsmallest stopping set in the Tanner graph for $C$ depends on the corresponding\nchoice of a parity-check matrix. It is easy to see that $s \\le d$, where $d$ is\nthe minimum Hamming distance of $C$, and we show that it is always possible to\nchoose a parity-check matrix for $C$ (with sufficiently many dependent rows)\nsuch that $s = d$. We thus introduce a new parameter, termed the \\emph{stopping\nredundancy} of $C$, defined as the minimum number of rows in a parity-check\nmatrix $H$ for $C$ such that the corresponding stopping distance $s(H)$ attains\nits largest possible value, namely $s(H) = d$.\n  We then derive general bounds on the stopping redundancy of linear codes. We\nalso examine several simple ways of constructing codes from other codes, and\nstudy the effect of these constructions on the stopping redundancy.\nSpecifically, for the family of binary Reed-Muller codes (of all orders), we\nprove that their stopping redundancy is at most a constant times their\nconventional redundancy. We show that the stopping redundancies of the binary\nand ternary extended Golay codes are at most 35 and 22, respectively.

In our work, we differentiate\nbetween the relay, cooperative broadcast (down-link), and cooperative\nmultiple-access (up-link) channels. For the relay channel, we investigate two\nclasses of cooperation schemes; namely, Amplify and Forward (AF) protocols and\nDecode and Forward (DF) protocols. For the first class, we establish an upper\nbound on the achievable diversity-multiplexing tradeoff with a single relay. We\nthen construct a new AF protocol that achieves this upper bound. The proposed\nalgorithm is then extended to the general case with N-1 relays where it is\nshown to outperform the space-time coded protocol of Laneman and Worenell\nwithout requiring decoding/encoding at the relays. For the class of DF\nprotocols, we develop a dynamic decode and forward (DDF) protocol that achieves\nthe optimal tradeoff for multiplexing gains 0 < r < 1/N. Furthermore, with a\nsingle relay, the DDF protocol is shown to dominate the class of AF protocols\nfor all multiplexing gains. The superiority of the DDF protocol is shown to be\nmore significant in the cooperative broadcast channel. The situation is\nreversed in the cooperative multiple-access channel where we propose a new AF\nprotocol that achieves the optimal tradeoff for all multiplexing gains. A\ndistinguishing feature of the proposed protocols in the three scenarios is that\nthey do not rely on orthogonal subspaces, allowing for a more efficient use of\nresources. In fact, using our results one can argue that the sub-optimality of\npreviously proposed protocols stems from their use of orthogonal subspaces\nrather than the half-duplex constraint.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 12 figures, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

It is\nknown that a family of polyphase Golay sequences of length 2^m organizes in\nm!/2 cosets of a q-ary generalization of the first-order Reed-Muller code,\nRM_q(1,m). In this paper a more general construction technique for cosets of\nRM_q(1,m) with low PMEPR is established. These cosets contain so-called\nnear-complementary sequences. The application of this theory is then\nillustrated by providing some construction examples. First, it is shown that\nthe m!/2 cosets of RM_q(1,m) comprised of Golay sequences just arise as a\nspecial case. Second, further families of cosets of RM_q(1,m) with maximum\nPMEPR between 2 and 4 are presented, showing that some previously unexplained\nphenomena can now be understood within a unified framework. A lower bound on\nthe PMEPR of cosets of RM_q(1,m) is proved as well, and it is demonstrated that\nthe upper bound on the PMEPR is tight in many cases. Finally it is shown that\nall upper bounds on the PMEPR of cosets of RM_q(1,m) also hold for the\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) under the Walsh-Hadamard transform.\n"]}]

In at least 12\ncases these codes improve the minimum distance of the previously known best\nlinear codes for fixed parameters n,k. Among these new codes there is an\noptimal ternary [88,8,54] code.\n  We develop an algorithm, which starts with already good codes C, i.e. codes\nwith high minimum distance d for given length n and dimension k over the field\nGF(q). The algorithm is based on the newly defined (l,s)-extension. This is a\ngeneralization of the well-known method of adding a parity bit in the case of a\nbinary linear code of odd minimum weight. (l,s)-extension tries to extend the\ngenerator matrix of C by adding l columns with the property that at least s of\nthe l letters added to each of the codewords of minimum weight in C are\ndifferent from 0. If one finds such columns the minimum distance of the\nextended code is d+s provided that the second smallest weight in C was at least\nd+s. The question whether such columns exist can be settled using a Diophantine\nsystem of equations.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]
