We present a computerized system\ndesigned to improve percutaneous renal access by projecting the ultrasound\npuncture tract onto fluoroscopic images. Materials and Methods: The system\nconsists of a computer and a localizer allowing spatial localization of the\nposition of the various instruments. Without any human intervention, the\nultrasound nephrostomy tract is superimposed in real time onto fluoroscopic\nimages acquired in various views. Results: We tested our approach by laboratory\nexperiments on a phantom. Also, after approval by our institution's Ethics\nCommittee, we validated this technique in the operating room during PCNL in one\npatient. Conclusion: Our system is reliable, and the absence of\nimage-processing procedures makes it robust.

Relativistic shocks are essentially always\nsuperluminal, and thus they preferentially generate steep particle spectra with\ncutoffs well below the maximum scattering energy, often not exceeding the\nenergy of the compressed background plasma ions. Thus, cosmic-ray acceleration\nto very high energies at relativistic shock waves is inefficient, and such\nshocks are not expected to be the sources of ultra-high-energy particles.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, Proceedings of the 30th ICRC, Merida, Mexico 2007"]}]
