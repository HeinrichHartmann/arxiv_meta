The presented work is an extension of the works\ndone by Wilson and Beavers (1974), Tarnopolsky (2000). The range of the playing\nfrequencies is investigated. The first results are analytical : when no losses\nare present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold\nfrequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within\nthe interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth.\nActually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g.\nthe results by Cullen et al.. The smallest blowing pressure is found to be\ndirectly related to the quality factor of the reed.
