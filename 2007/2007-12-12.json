We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime.

But what are the principal\ngeometric features that control the long-time dynamics? We suggest that the key\nlies not in the local minima and saddles of the landscape, but in a more global\nproperty of the surface: its accessible pathways. In order to make this notion\nmore precise we introduce two ideas: (1) a switch to a new ensemble that\nremoves the concept of potential barriers from the problem, and (2) a way of\nfinding optimum pathways within this new ensemble. The potential energy\nlandscape ensemble, which we describe in the current paper, regards the maximum\naccessible potential energy, rather than the temperature, as a control\nvariable. We show here that while this approach is thermodynamically equivalent\nto the canonical ensemble, it not only sidesteps the idea of barriers, it\nallows us to be quantitative about the connectivity of a landscape. We\nillustrate these ideas with calculations on a simple atomic liquid and on the\nKob-Andersen model of a glass-forming liquid, showing, in the process, that the\nlandscape of the Kob-Anderson model appears to have a connectivity transition\nat the landscape energy associated with its mode-coupling transition.

We study the design of robust\nbroadcasting schemes that minimize the transmission power necessary to\nguarantee that the QoS requirements are satisfied for all channels within\nbounded uncertainty regions around the transmitter's estimate of each user's\nchannel. Each user's QoS requirement is formulated as a constraint on the mean\nsquare error (MSE) in its received signal, and we show that these MSE\nconstraints imply constraints on the received SINR. Using the MSE constraints,\nwe present a unified design approach for robust linear and non-linear\ntransceivers with QoS requirements. The proposed designs overcome the\nlimitations of existing approaches that provide conservative designs or are\nonly applicable to the case of linear precoding. Furthermore, we provide\ncomputationally-efficient design formulations for a rather general model of\nchannel uncertainty that subsumes many natural choices for the uncertainty\nregion.
