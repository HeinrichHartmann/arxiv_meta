The source signal arrives at the destination\nvia N hops through N-1 layers of relays. We analyze the diversity of such\nchannels with fixed network size at high SNR. In the clustered case where the\nrelays within the same layer can have full cooperation, the cooperative\ndecode-and-forward (DF) scheme is shown to be optimal in terms of the\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT). The upper bound on the DMT, the cut-set\nbound, is attained. In the non-clustered case, we show that the naive\namplify-and-forward (AF) scheme has the maximum multiplexing gain of the\nchannel but is suboptimal in diversity, as compared to the cut-set bound. To\nimprove the diversity, space-time relay processing is introduced through the\nparallel partition of the multihop channel. The idea is to let the source\nsignal go through K different \"AF paths\" in the multihop channel. This parallel\nAF scheme creates a parallel channel in the time domain and has the maximum\ndiversity if the partition is properly designed. Since this scheme does not\nachieve the maximum multiplexing gain in general, we propose a flip-and-forward\n(FF) scheme that is built from the parallel AF scheme. It is shown that the FF\nscheme achieves both the maximum diversity and multiplexing gains in a\ndistributed multihop channel of arbitrary size. In order to realize the DMT\npromised by the relaying strategies, approximately universal coding schemes are\nalso proposed.\n","Comment: 62 pages, 10 figures, submitted to the IEEE transactions on\n  Information Theory.

However,\nthat theory did not account for interactions between the electrons. Here we\ninvestigate the interplay between the electron-electron interactions and\ndisorder near the MIT using simultaneous measurements of electrical resistivity\nand magnetoconductance. We show that both the resistance and interaction\namplitude exhibit a fan-like spread as the MIT is crossed. From these data we\nconstruct a resistance-interaction flow diagram of the MIT that clearly reveals\na quantum critical point, as predicted by the two-parameter scaling theory\n(Punnoose and Finkel'stein, Science 310, 289 (2005)). The metallic side of this\ndiagram is accurately described by the renormalization group theory without any\nfitting parameters. In particular, the metallic temperature dependence of the\nresistance sets in when the interaction amplitude reaches gamma_2 = 0.45 - a\nvalue in remarkable agreement with the one predicted by the theory.\n","Comment: as published"]}]

Our objective is to design\nan alarm time which is adapted to the history of the arrival process and\ndetects the disorder time as soon as possible. In previous solvable versions of\nthe Poisson disorder problem, the arrival rate after the disorder has been\nassumed a known constant. In reality, however, we may at most have some prior\ninformation about the likely values of the new arrival rate before the disorder\nactually happens, and insufficient estimates of the new rate after the disorder\nhappens. Consequently, we assume in this paper that the new arrival rate after\nthe disorder is a random variable. The detection problem is shown to admit a\nfinite-dimensional Markovian sufficient statistic, if the new rate has a\ndiscrete distribution with finitely many atoms. Furthermore, the detection\nproblem is cast as a discounted optimal stopping problem with running cost for\na finite-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov process. This optimal\nstopping problem is studied in detail in the special case where the new arrival\nrate has Bernoulli distribution. This is a nontrivial optimal stopping problem\nfor a two-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov process driven by the same\npoint process.
