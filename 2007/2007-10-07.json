First, bundles of groups other than tori, even\nbundles of some nonabelian groups, can be dualized. Second, bundles whose duals\nare families of noncommutative groups (in the sense of noncommutative geometry)\ncan be treated, though in this case the base space of the bundles is best\nviewed as a topological stack.\n  Some methods developed for the construction may be of independent interest.\nThese are a Pontryagin type duality that interchanges commutative principal\nbundles with gerbes, a nonabelian Takai type duality for groupoids, and the\ncomputation of certain equivariant Brauer groups.\n","Comment: Same theorems, typos corrected"]}]

We separate the\nthermal and nonthermal components of the radio continuum emission without the\nassumption of a constant nonthermal spectral index. Using the Spitzer FIR data\nat 70 and 160 $\\mu$m and a standard dust model, we deredden the H$\\alpha$\nemission. The extinction corrected H$\\alpha$ emission serves as a template for\nthe thermal free-free radio emission. Subtracting from the observed 3.6 cm and\n20 cm emission (Effelsberg and the VLA) this free-free emission, we obtain the\nnonthermal maps. A constant electron temperature used to obtain the thermal\nradio intensity seems appropriate for M~33 which, unlike the Milky Way, has a\nshallow metallicity gradient. For the first time, we derive the distribution of\nthe nonthermal spectral index across a galaxy, M33. We detect strong nonthermal\nemission from the spiral arms and star-forming regions. Wavelet analysis shows\nthat at 3.6 cm the nonthermal emission is dominated by contributions from\nstar-forming regions, while it is smoothly distributed at 20 cm. For the whole\ngalaxy, we obtain thermal fractions of 51% and 18% at 3.6 cm and 20 cm,\nrespectively. The thermal emission is slightly stronger in the southern than in\nthe northern half of the galaxy. We find a clear radial gradient of mean\nextinction in the galactic plane. The nonthermal spectral index map indicates\nthat the relativistic electrons suffer energy-loss when diffusing from their\norigin in star-forming regions towards interarm regions and the outer parts of\nthe galaxy. We also conclude that the radio emission is mostly nonthermal at R\n$>$ 5 kpc in M33.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in the Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics journal"]}]

Per-flow accounting is considered hard because\nit requires that many counters be updated at a very high speed; however, the\nlarge fast memories needed for storing the counters are prohibitively\nexpensive. Therefore, current approaches aim to obtain approximate flow counts;\nthat is, to detect large elephant flows and then measure their sizes.\n  Recently the authors and their collaborators have developed [1] a novel\nmethod for per-flow traffic measurement that is fast, highly memory efficient\nand accurate. At the core of this method is a novel counter architecture called\n\"counter braids.'' In this paper, we analyze the performance of the counter\nbraid architecture under a Maximum Likelihood (ML) flow size estimation\nalgorithm and show that it is optimal; that is, the number of bits needed to\nstore the size of a flow matches the entropy lower bound. While the ML\nalgorithm is optimal, it is too complex to implement.
