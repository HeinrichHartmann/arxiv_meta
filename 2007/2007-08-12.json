Using their 2-dimensional maps of the stellar velocity,\nvelocity dispersion, and absorption line strength, it is now much easier to\nunderstand the nature of nearby galactic bulges.

Our existence\nresult uses a modification of a construction due to Mohnke (originally in the\ncontext of Legendrian chords), and an energy--capacity inequality of Chekanov.\nIn essence, we show the existence of a homoclinic orbit by showing a certain\nLagrangian embedding cannot exist.
