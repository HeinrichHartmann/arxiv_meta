The failure of the Chandra and XXM-Newton telescopes\nto detect cooling gas (below 1-2 keV) in clusters of galaxies has suggested\nthat some heating process must work to suppress the cooling. The most likely\nheating source is the heating by AGNs. There are many heating mechanisms, but\nwe will adopt the effervescent heating model which is a result of the\ninteraction of the bubbles inflated by AGN with the intra-cluster medium(ICM).\n  Using the FLASH code, we have carried out time dependent simulations to\ninvestigate the effect of the heating on the suppression of the cooling in\ncooling flow clusters. We have found that the effervescent heating model can\nnot balance the radiative cooling and it is an artificial model. Furthermore,\nthe effervescent heating is a function of the ICM pressure gradient but the\ncooling is proportional to the gas density square and square root of the gas\ntemperature.\n"]}]

It is a\nsystematic low-energy expansion based on symmetry considerations and on the\nfact that the holes are located in pockets centered at k=(pi/2a,\\pm pi/2a).\nEven though the symmetries are extracted from the Hubbard model, the effective\ntheory is universal and makes model-independent predictions about the dynamical\nmechanisms in the antiferromagnetic phase.
