The prototype considered in this paper is a mechanical system\nconsisting of a set of rigid bodies in interaction through magnetic fields. The\nsystem is stochastically forced by white noise and dissipative through\nmechanical friction. The Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at a specific temperature\ndefines the unique invariant measure under the flow of this stochastic process\nand allows us to define ``the temperature'' of the system.

In particular, the\ndynamics is characterized by a meta-stable state in which the system exhibits\ndirected motion over random time scales. This phenomenon is caused by\ninteraction of three attributes of the system: a non flat (yet bounded)\npotential energy landscape, a rigid body effect (coupling translational\nmomentum and angular momentum through friction) and the degeneracy of the\nnoise/friction tensor on the momentums (the fact that noise is not applied to\nall degrees of freedom).\n","Comment: 33 pages"]}]
