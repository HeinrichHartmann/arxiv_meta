The dramatic\nimprovement of the room temperature conductivity of Nd0.8Ca0.2CoO3 with respect\nto the pure and the Na-doped compound is explained in terms of a different\nspin-state for the Co ions within this structure. The higher conductivity and\nthe absence of anomalies in the thermal expansion makes the Ca-doped compound\nmore attractive than the pure NdCoO3 in view of possible applications. The\nexperimental data and the Co environment analysis here discussed, in particular\nbond lengths distortion and bending angles, are fully consistent with a spin\nstate (low to intermediate) transition in NdCoO3\n","Comment: 32 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Particle and fluid\nmodel deviate because electrons with high energies do not yet fully run away\nfrom the front, but are somewhat ahead. This leads to increasing ionization\nrates in the particle model at the very tip of the front. The energy overshoot\nof electrons in the leading edge of the front actually agrees quantitatively\nwith the energy overshoot in the leading edge of an electron swarm or avalanche\nin the same electric field.\n","Comment: The paper has 17 pages, including 15 figures and 3 tables"]}]
