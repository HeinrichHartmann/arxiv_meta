To describe the kinetic of the Chloroflexus\naurantiacus RC's we use incoherent model of electron transfer. It was shown\nthat the asymmetry in electronic coupling must be included to explain the\nexperiments. For the description of Rhodobacter sphaeroides H(M182)L mutation\nwe used partially coherent as incoherent models of electron transfer.

The motivation for the proposed filters arises from\nthe possibility of avoiding the generation of certain interference and noise\nterms in a given stage that would have been present in a conventional LPIC\n(CLPIC). In the proposed filters, we achieve such avoidance of the generation\nof interference and noise terms in a given stage by simply making the diagonal\nelements of a certain matrix in that stage equal to zero. Hence, the proposed\nfilters do not require additional complexity compared to the CLPIC, and they\ncan allow achieving a certain error performance using fewer LPIC stages.

Existing location services use node identifiers to determine the\nlocator (aka anchor) that is responsible for keeping track of a node's\nlocation. Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no\nclue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the\nsource/destination shortest path, which increases both location delays and\nbandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy\nthat identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a\ndestination to be close to these nodes- i.e., locators are identified depending\non the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns\nof nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations,\ndefined according to the past and present patterns of mobility. Correspondent\nnodes fetch this agenda only once and use it as a reference for identifying\nwhich locators are responsible for the node at different points in time. Over a\nperiod of about one year, the weekly proportion of nodes having at least 50% of\nexact location predictions is in average about 75%. This proportion increases\nby 10% when nodes also consider their closeness to the locator from only what\nthey know about the network.\n"]}]

We then analyze the robustness of the constructed\nlinear minimum MSE (LMMSE) estimator to erasures of the fusion frame subspaces.\nWe prove that tight fusion frames consisting of equi-dimensional subspaces have\nmaximum robustness (in the MSE sense) with respect to erasures of one subspace,\nand that the optimal subspace dimension depends on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\nWe also prove that tight fusion frames consisting of equi-dimensional subspaces\nwith equal pairwise chordal distances are most robust with respect to two and\nmore subspace erasures. We call such fusion frames equi-distance tight fusion\nframes, and prove that the chordal distance between subspaces in such fusion\nframes meets the so-called simplex bound, and thereby establish connections\nbetween equi-distance tight fusion frames and optimal Grassmannian packings.\nFinally, we present several examples for construction of equi-distance tight\nfusion frames.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]
