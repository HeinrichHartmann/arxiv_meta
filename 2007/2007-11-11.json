The manuscript was submitted to Chemical Engineering Science. To\nclarify the situation, we copy the main comment from an anonymous referee here:\n\"To my understanding, the authors analyze i = 1 ... 63 time series and\ncalculate their mean and standard deviation. These time series correspond to\nindividual, single ignition processes. Is this correct? If yes, these\nprocesses, as Fig. 3 shows very clearly, are not stationary, and the pressure\ndifference (i.e., the signal) quickly decays to zero. In this case both the\nmean and the standard deviation are poorly defined, for example because both\ndepend in a trivial fashion on the observation period T. I am not aware of any\nstudy (including those cited by the authors) which allows for any conclusion\nfrom such non-stationary signals. The results of Menezes and Barabasi are\nstrictly only valid for stationary time series, and they cannot be applied at\nall in this case.\" We agree with this insightful comment that our data are not\nstationary and the method adopted in our manuscript does not apply. We do not\nsee any possibility to correct this error and decide to withdraw it. We would\nlike to thank gratefully the referee and apologize for any inconvenience caused\nby our oversight.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn"]}]
