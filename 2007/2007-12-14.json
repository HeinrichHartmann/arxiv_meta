Such generalized Poincar\\'e inequalities have been introduced by W.\nBeckner in the gaussian case and provide, along the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow,\nthe exponential decay of some generalized entropies which interpolate between\nthe $L^2$ norm and the usual entropy. Our criterion improves on results which,\nfor instance, can be deduced from the Bakry-Emery criterion and Holley-Stroock\ntype perturbation results. In a second step, we apply the same strategy to\nnon-linear equations of porous media type. This provides new interpolation\ninequalities and decay estimates for the solutions of the evolution problem.\nThe criterion is again a non-local condition based on the positivity of the\nlowest eigenvalue of a Schr\\\"odinger operator.

Since the resulting criterion is\nnon-local, it is better adapted to potentials with, for instance, a\nnon-quadratic growth at infinity, or to unbounded perturbations of the\npotential.\n"]}]

Here we report a reproducible\nprotocol for creating three-dimensional samples of bijel in which the\ninterfaces are stabilized by essentially a single layer of particles.
