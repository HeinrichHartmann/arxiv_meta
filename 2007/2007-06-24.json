These systems give users the opportunity to\nadd data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The\nresult is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent\nstudies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content\nand the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.\nThus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to\nimprove the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This\npaper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability\nin a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of\ntwo collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature:\nCiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze\nthe tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define\nnew metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover\nthe structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover\nsuggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals\nwith unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.\nFinally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based\nstructure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as\ncommunities scale.\n","Comment: 8 pages.

Using this description, we introduce a\nvector-valued quadratic invariant $b$ on the space of those isometric\ndeformations which, for convex polygons, has a remarkable positivity property.\n  We give two geometric applications. The first is an isoperimetric statement\nfor hyperbolic polygons: among the convex hyperbolic polygons with given edge\nlengths, there is a unique polygon with vertices on a circle, a horocycle, or\non one connected component of the space of points at constant distance from a\ngeodesic, and it has maximal area. The second application is a new proof of the\ninfinitesimal rigidity of convex polyhedra in the Euclidean space, and a new\nrigidity result for polyhedral surfaces in the Minkowski space.\n  Finally we indicate how the invariant $b$ can be used to define natural\nmetrics on the space of convex spherical (or hyperbolic) polygons with fixed\nedge lengths. Those metrics are related to known (and interesting) metrics on\nthe space of convex polygons with given angles in the plane.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 3 figures.
