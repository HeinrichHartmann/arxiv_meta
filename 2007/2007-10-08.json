On the one hand, we consider MCCGS, standing for Minimal Canonical\nComprehensive Groebner Systems, a recently introduced computational tool\nyielding \"good\" bases for ideals of polynomials over a field depending on\nseveral parameters, that specialize \"well\", for instance, regarding the number\nof solutions for the given ideal, for different values of the parameters.

Such truncation is justified, at sufficiently low\nenergy, in the framework of a systematic chiral expansion.
