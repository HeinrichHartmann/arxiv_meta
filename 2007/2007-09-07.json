In these networks the average size of the\nfluctuations becomes finite (synchronized state) and the extreme fluctuations\ntypically diverge only logarithmically in the large system-size limit ensuring\nsynchronization in a practical sense. Provided that local fluctuations in the\nnetwork are short-tailed, the statistics of the extremes are governed by the\nGumbel distribution.
