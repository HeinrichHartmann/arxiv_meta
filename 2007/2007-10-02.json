We deal with nonseparable lattices\nconsidering different initial atomic distributions in the highly symmetric\nstates. For analytical description of the condensate before instabilities are\ndeveloped, we derive several few-mode models, analyzing both essentially\nnonlinear and quasi-linear regimes of tunneling. By direct numerical\nsimulations, we show that two-mode models provide accurate description of the\ntunneling when either initially two states are populated or tunneling occurs\nbetween two stable states. Otherwise a two-mode model may give only useful\nqualitative hints for understanding tunneling but does not reproduce many\nfeatures of the phenomenon. This reflects crucial role of the instabilities\ndeveloped due to two-body interactions resulting in non-negligible population\nof the higher bands. This effect becomes even more pronounced in the case of\naccelerating lattices. In the latter case we show that the direction of the\nacceleration is a relevant physical parameter which affects the tunneling by\nchanging the atomic rates at different symmetric states and by changing the\nnumbers of bands involved in the atomic transfer.\n"]}]

The key idea is to\nreformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more\ntractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these\nconstraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which\nis then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization\nleads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then\nit corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise\nthere is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution.\nThus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming\ntechniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product\n(TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations,\nwhere the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also\nconsider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g.\nloops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we\npropose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary''\nvariables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or\neliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or\nLagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the\niterative optimization procedure.\n","Comment: 10 pages, presented at 45th Allerton conference on communication,\n  control and computing, to appear in proceedings"]}]

We propose new achievable rates based on elementary compression and\nalso on a Wyner-Ziv (CEO-like) processing, for both fast fading and block\nfading channels, as well as for general discrete channels. The simpler two\nagents scheme is solved, up to an implicit equation with a single variable.\nLimiting the nomadic transmitter to a circular-symmetric complex Gaussian\nsignalling, new upper bounds are derived for both fast and block fading, based\non the vector version of the entropy power inequality. These bounds are then\ncompared to the achievable rates in several extreme scenarios. The asymptotic\nsetting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is\nanalyzed. In addition, the upper bounds are analytically shown to be tight in\nseveral examples, while numerical calculations reveal a rather small gap in a\nfinite $2\\times2$ setting. The advantage of the Wyner-Ziv approach over\nelementary compression is shown where only the former can achieve the full\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff.

Equivariant quantization and dequantization establish a\ntight link between invariant operators connecting modules of differential\noperators on tensor densities, and module morphisms that connect the\ncorresponding dequantized spaces. In this paper, we investigate dequantized\ndifferential operators as modules over a Lie subalgebra of vector fields that\npreserve an additional structure. More precisely, we take an interest in\ninvariant operators between dequantized spaces, viewed as modules over the Lie\nsubalgebra of infinitesimal contact or projective contact transformations. The\nprincipal symbols of these invariant operators are invariant tensor fields. We\nfirst provide full description of the algebras of such affine-contact- and\ncontact-invariant tensor fields. These characterizations allow showing that the\nalgebra of projective-contact-invariant operators between dequantized spaces\nimplemented by the same density weight, is generated by the vertical cotangent\nlift of the contact form and a generalized contact Hamiltonian. As an\napplication, we prove a second key-result, which asserts that the Casimir\noperator of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal projective contact\ntransformations, is diagonal. Eventually, this upshot entails that invariant\noperators between spaces induced by different density weights, are made up by a\nsmall number of building bricks that force the parameters of the source and\ntarget spaces to verify Diophantine-type equations.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

The loss function is defined as\ngeneralized quadratic distance between the true density and the proposed model.\nThese distances are characterized by a simple quadratic form structure that is\nadaptable through the choice of a nonnegative definite kernel and a bandwidth\nparameter. Using asymptotic results for the quadratic distances we build a\nquick-to-compute approximation for the risk function. Its derivation is\nanalogous to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), but unlike AIC, the\nquadratic risk is a global comparison tool. The method does not require\nresampling, a great advantage when point estimators are expensive to compute.\nThe method is illustrated using the problem of selecting the number of\ncomponents in a mixture model, where it is shown that, by using an appropriate\nkernel, the method is computationally straightforward in arbitrarily high data\ndimensions. In this same context it is shown that the method has some clear\nadvantages over AIC and BIC.\n","Comment: Updated with reviewer suggestions"]}]

When present, it limits operating gradient directly or via\ninduced heat load at 2K. In order to minimize particulate contamination of and\nthus field emission in the CEBAF SRF cavities during assembly, a cold ceramic\nRF window was placed very close to the accelerating cavity proper. As an\nunintended consequence of this, the window is charged by field-emitted\nelectrons, making it possible to monitor and model field emission in the CEBAF\ncavities since in-tunnel operation began.

Fractional loss averaged 0.18 (sigma 0.12) of pre-event\ngradient. This event count corresponds to 2.4 events per century per cavity, or\n8 per year in CEBAF.

The circuit consists of a kinase and\nphosphatase acting on multiple sites of a substrate that, contingent on its\nmodification state, catalyzes its own phosphorylation and, in a symmetric\nscenario, dephosphorylation. The symmetric case is viewed as a cartoon of\nconflicting feedback that could result from antagonistic pathways impinging on\nthe state of a shared component.\n  Results: Multisite phosphorylation is sufficient for bistable behavior under\nfeedback even when catalysis is linear in substrate concentration, which is the\ncase we consider. We compute the phase diagram, fluctuation spectrum and\nlarge-deviation properties related to switch memory within a statistical\nmechanics framework. Bistability occurs as either a first-order or second-order\nnon-equilibrium phase transition, depending on the network symmetries and the\nratio of phosphatase to kinase numbers. In the second-order case, the circuit\nnever leaves the bistable regime upon increasing the number of substrate\nmolecules at constant kinase to phosphatase ratio.\n  Conclusions: The number of substrate molecules is a key parameter controlling\nboth the onset of the bistable regime, fluctuation intensity, and the residence\ntime in a switched state. The relevance of the concept of memory depends on the\ndegree of switch symmetry, as memory presupposes information to be remembered,\nwhich is highest for equal residence times in the switched states.\n  Reviewers: This article was reviewed by Artem Novozhilov (nominated by Eugene\nKoonin), Sergei Maslov, and Ned Wingreen.\n","Comment: Version published in Biology Direct including reviewer comments and\n  author responses, 28 pages, 7 figures"]}]
