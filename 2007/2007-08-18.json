In this\nmodel, the binding affinity of dynein for microtubule is independent of its\nnucleotide state and the change between strong and weak microtubule-binding is\ndetermined naturally by the variation of relative orientation between the stalk\nand microtubule as the stalk rotates following nucleotide-state transition.\nThus the enigmatic communication from the ATP binding site in the globular\ndomain to the far MT-binding site in the tip of the stalk, which is\nprerequisite in conventional models, is not required. Using the present model,\nthe previous experimental results such as the effect of ATP and ADP bindings on\ndissociation of dynein from microtubule, the processive movement of\nsingle-headed axonemal dyneins at saturating ATP concentration, the load\ndependence of step size for the processive movement of two-headed cytoplasmic\ndyneins and the dependence of stall force on ATP concentration can be well\nexplained.\n"]}]
