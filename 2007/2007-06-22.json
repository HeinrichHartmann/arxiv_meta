The polymer ensemble is described on the mesoscopic level by a\nset of stochastic ordinary differential equations with Brownian noise. The\ndynamics of the Newtonian solvent is determined by the Navier-Stokes equations.\nMomentum transfer of the dumbbells with the solvent is implemented by an\nadditional volume forcing term in the Navier-Stokes equations, such that both\ncomponents of the resulting viscoelastic fluid are connected by a two-way\ncoupling. The dynamics of the dumbbells is given then by Newton's second law of\nmotion including small inertia effects. We investigate the dynamics of the flow\nfor different degrees of dumbbell elasticity and inertia, as given by\nWeissenberg and Stokes numbers, respectively. For the parameters accessible in\nour study, the magnitude of the feedback of the polymers on the macroscopic\nproperties of turbulence remains small as quantified by the global energy\nbudget and the Reynolds stresses.
