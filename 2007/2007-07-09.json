One\ncan now consider the non commutative deformation of $\\cal X$ given by the\ninvariant algebra $A_l(\\mathbb{C})^G$, where $A_l(\\mathbb{C})$ stands for the\nWeyl algebra of rank $l$. There exist two families of natural examples of this\nsituation. The first concerns wreath products of a finite subgroup of\n$SL(2,\\mathbb{C})$ with an appropriate symmetric group acting on\n$(\\mathbb{C}^2)^n$; the second family is constructed with a Weyl group $W$\nacting on the double of the reflexion representation ${\\mathfrak{h}}\\oplus\n{\\mathfrak{h}}^*$. A nice result of Berest, Etingof and Ginzburg establishes\nthe finiteness of the dimension of $HP_0({\\cal X})= \\mathbb{C}[\\cal\nX]/\\{\\mathbb{C}[\\cal X], \\mathbb{C}[\\cal X]\\}$, the Poisson trace group of\n$\\cal X$. The purpose of this work is to compute this dimension in certain\ncases and in particular to compare it to the dimension of the usual trace group\nof the above mentioned non commutative deformation. The principal theorem\nestablihed here is : {\\bf Theorem.} With the above notations, we have the\nfollowing equality: $$dim_\\mathbb{C} HP_0({{\\mathfrak{h}}\\oplus\n{\\mathfrak{h}}^*}/W)=dim_\\mathbb{C} HH_0(A_l(\\mathbb{C})^W).$$ Moreover, this\ncommon dimension is 1 in type $ A_2$, 2 in type $B_2$ and 3 in type $G_2$. We\nalso give examples where the difference of these two dimensions is unbounded.\n","Comment: 24 pages, french, revised version.

This observation has often been rationalized on the basis of a\nnucleation mechanism for protein folding whose basic premise is the idea that\nafter completion of a specific set of contacts forming the so-called folding\nnucleus the native state is achieved promptly. Here we propose a methodology to\nidentify folding nuclei in small lattice polymers and apply it to the study of\nprotein molecules with chain length N=48. To investigate the extent to which\nprotein topology is a robust determinant of the nucleation mechanism we compare\nthe nucleation scenario of a native-centric model with that of a sequence\nspecific model sharing the same native fold. To evaluate the impact of the\nsequence's finner details in the nucleation mechanism we consider the folding\nof two non- homologous sequences. We conclude that in a sequence-specific model\nthe folding nucleus is, to some extent, formed by the most stable contacts in\nthe protein and that the less stable linkages in the folding nucleus are solely\ndetermined by the fold's topology. We have also found that independently of\nprotein sequence the folding nucleus performs the same `topological' function.\nThis unifying feature of the nucleation mechanism results from the residues\nforming the folding nucleus being distributed along the protein chain in a\nsimilar and well-defined manner that is determined by the fold's topological\nfeatures.\n","Comment: 10 Figures.
