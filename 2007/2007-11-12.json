Accreting compact objects,\nsuch as black holes, are seen to emit relativistic puffs of plasma:\n`cannonballs' (CBs). The inner domain of a rotating star whose core has\ncollapsed resembles such an accreting system. This suggests that core-collapse\nsupernovae (SNe) emit CBs, as SN1987A did. The fate of a CB as it exits a SN\nand travels in space can be studied as a function of the CB's mass and energy,\nand of `ambient' properties: the encountered matter- and light- distributions,\nthe composition of the former, and the location of intelligent observers. The\nlatter may conclude that the interactions of CBs with ambient matter and light\ngenerate CRs and GRBs, all of whose properties can be described by this `CB\nmodel' with few parameters and simple physics. GRB data are still being taken\nin unscrutinized domains of energy and timing. They agree accurately with the\nmodel's predictions. CR data are centenary. Their precision will improve, but\nnew striking predictions are unlikely. Yet, a one-free-parameter description of\nall CR data works very well. This is a bit as if one discovered QED today and\nonly needed to fit $\\alpha$.\n","Comment: Contribution to La Thuile Workshop 2007.
