Both types of irradiation create electrons and\nholes whose density and thermal evolution - notably via their interaction with\ndefects - are shown to determine the clustering and growth rates of Ag\nnanocrystals. We thus establish the influence of redox interactions of defects\nand silver (poly)ions. The mechanisms are similar to the latent image formation\nin photography: irradiation-induced photoelectrons are trapped within the glass\nmatrix, notably on dissolved noble metal ions and defects, which are thus\nneutralized (reverse oxidation reactions are also shown to exist). Annealing\npromotes metal atom diffusion, which in turn leads to cluster nuclei formation.\nThe cluster density depends not only on the irradiation fluence, but also - and\nprimarily - on the density of deposited energy and the redox properties of the\nglass. Ion irradiation (i.e., large deposited energy density) is far more\neffective in cluster formation, despite its lower neutralization efficiency\n(from Ag+ to Ag0) as compared to gamma photon irradiation.\n","Comment: 48 pages, 18 figures, revised version publ. in Phys.
