To fully exploit the unprecedented SOLIS/VSM data, however, one\nmust first address two critical problems: first, the study of solar active\nregions requires an automatic, physically intuitive, technique for\nactive-region identification in the solar disk. Second, use of active-region\nvector magnetograms requires removal of the azimuthal $180^o$-ambiguity in the\norientation of the transverse magnetic field component. Here we report on an\neffort to address both problems simultaneously and efficiently. To identify\nsolar active regions we apply an algorithm designed to locate complex,\nflux-balanced, magnetic structures with a dominant E-W orientation on the disk.\nEach of the disk portions corresponding to active regions is thereafter\nextracted and subjected to the Nonpotential Magnetic Field Calculation (NPFC)\nmethod that provides a physically-intuitive solution of the 180-degree\nambiguity. Both algorithms have been integrated into the VSM data pipeline and\noperate in real time, without human intervention.

The degree of\nrandomness and coherence of the binary sequence are measured by entropy and\nmutual information, depending on local structure that consists of a node with a\nhighly connected, called hub and its upstream nodes, and types of Boolean\nfunctions for the nodes. With a large number of output connections from a hub,\nthe effects of Boolean function on the hub are more prominent. The local\nstructures that give larger entropy tend to give rise to larger mutual\ninformation. Based on the numerical results and structural conditions we\nderived a time-independent transmission characteristic function of state\nvariables for the local structures. We obtained good relationships between the\nnumerical and analytical results, which indicate that dynamical properties from\nthe whole networks can be inferred from the differences in the local\nstructures.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables. submitted to AROB 12th '07"]}]

The maps are the partial transpose map and the $\\Phi$-map introduced by\nBreuer [H.-P. Breuer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 080501 (2006)]. The norm-based\nentanglement measures constructed from these two maps, called negativity and\n$\\Phi$-negativity, respectively, lead to two sets of bounds on the entanglement\nof formation, the tangle, and the concurrence. We compare these bounds and\nidentify the sets of 4 x N density operators for which the bounds from one\nconstraint are better than the bounds from the other. In the process, we\npresent a new derivation of the already known bound on the concurrence based on\nthe negativity.
