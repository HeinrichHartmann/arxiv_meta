On the other\nhand, the field EHB population shows evidence of a remarkably high binary\nfraction. Such a difference among globular cluster and field populations,\nalthough not yet explained in detail on the basis of theoretical models, must\nnecessarily be related to different formation histories for EHB stars in the\nfield and in clusters. In this framework, preliminary results indicate that\nclose systems could be relatively common in the peculiar globular cluster NGC\n2808, although the sample of studied stars is still small.

Within such models, the location of the moving protonic charge can\nbe specified by the so called center of charge, defined as a weighted average\nover the diabatic states of the EVB model. In this paper, we use first order\nperturbation theory to calculate the molecular forces that arise if a bias\npotential is applied to the center of charge.

Contrary to\npredictions of continuum electrostatics but in agreement with previous computer\nsimulations of similar systems, we observe that the excess proton is\npredominantly located at the surface of the droplet.

As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes\npropagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition\nwhere we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together\nwith the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution \"plasmonic\".\nThe remaining modes are propagative cavity modes, which we call \"photonic\". The\nCasimir energy contains two main contributions, one coming from the plasmonic,\nthe other from the photonic modes. Surprisingly we find that the plasmonic\ncontribution to the Casimir energy becomes repulsive for intermediate and large\nmirror separations. Alternatively, we discuss the common surface plasmon\ndefintion, which includes only evanescent waves, where this effect is not\nfound. We show that, in contrast to an intuitive expectation, for both\ndefinitions the Casimir energy is the sum of two very large contributions which\nnearly cancel each other.

A precise study of the joint weak convergence rate of both algorithms\nis given; it turns out that, unlike the location of the maximum, the size of\nthe maximum can be approximated by an algorithm which converges at the\nparametric rate.
