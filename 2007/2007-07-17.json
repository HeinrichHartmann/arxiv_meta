In this context, it is important to measure the impact of P2P\nIPTV on the networks and to characterize this traffic. Dur- ing the 2006 FIFA\nWorld Cup, we performed an extensive measurement campaign. We measured network\ntraffic generated by broadcasting soc- cer games by the most popular P2P IPTV\napplications, namely PPLive, PPStream, SOPCast and TVAnts. From the collected\ndata, we charac- terized the P2P IPTV traffic structure at different time\nscales by using wavelet based transform method. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work, which presents a complete multiscale analysis of the\nP2P IPTV traffic. Our results show that the scaling properties of the TCP\ntraffic present periodic behavior whereas the UDP traffic is stationary and\nlead to long- range depedency characteristics. For all the applications, the\ndownload traffic has different characteristics than the upload traffic. The\nsignaling traffic has a significant impact on the download traffic but it has\nnegligible impact on the upload.

The trajectories of diffusing water\nmolecules are directly sampled, using random `walkers'. By counting how many of\nthese trajectories intersect the surface of the ice particle (which may be any\nshape) and how many escape outside a spherical boundary far from the particle,\nthe capacitance of a number of model ice particle habits have been estimated,\nincluding hexagonal columns and plates, `scalene' columns and plates, bullets,\nbullet-rosettes, dendrites, and realistic aggregate snowflakes.

The capacitance for our modelled aggregate snowflakes (C/Dmax=0.25,\nnormalised by the maximum dimension Dmax) is shown to be in close agreement\nwith recent aircraft measurements of snowflake sublimation rates.

Reassignment events can be\nclassified according to the gain-loss framework. The gain represents the\nappearance of a new tRNA for the reassigned codon or the change of an existing\ntRNA such that it gains the ability to pair with the codon. The loss represents\nthe deletion of a tRNA or the change in a tRNA so that it no longer translates\nthe codon. One possible mechanism is Codon Disappearance, where the codon\ndisappears from the genome prior to the gain and loss events. In the\nalternative mechanisms the codon does not disappear. In the Unassigned Codon\nmechanism, the loss occurs first, whereas in the Ambiguous Intermediate\nmechanism, the gain occurs first. Codon usage analysis gives clear evidence of\ncases where the codon disappeared at the point of the reassignment and also\ncases where it did not disappear. Codon disappearance is the probable\nexplanation for stop to sense reassignments and a small number of reassignments\nof sense codons. However, the majority of sense to sense reassignments cannot\nbe explained by codon disappearance. In the latter cases, by analysis of the\npresence or absence of tRNAs in the genome and of the changes in tRNA\nsequences, it is sometimes possible to distinguish between the Unassigned Codon\nand Ambiguous Intermediate mechanisms.
