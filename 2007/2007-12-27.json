In this paper, our purpose is first to present another derivation\nof this result and then to introduce a generalization to non-equidimensional\nvarities. For the sake of clarity, we shall reformulate our first problem as\nfollows. Let $Z$ be an equidimensional variety (maybe singular and/or\nreducible) of dimension $n$, other than a linear space, embedded into $\\PP^r$,\n$r \\geq n+1$. The variety of trisecant lines of $Z$, say $V_{1,3}(Z)$, has\ndimension strictly less than $2n$, unless $Z$ is included in a\n$(n+1)-$dimensional linear space and has degree at least 3, in which case\n$\\dim(V_{1,3}(Z)) = 2n$. Then we inquire the more general case, where $Z$ is\nnot required to be equidimensional. In that case, let $Z$ be a possibly\nsingular variety of dimension $n$, that may be neither irreducible nor\nequidimensional, embedded into $\\PP^r$, where $r \\geq n+1$, and $Y$ a proper\nsubvariety of dimension $k \\geq 1$.

In the latter case, if the dimension of the space\nis stricly greater then $n+1$, the union of lines in $S$ cannot cover the whole\nspace. This is the main result of our work.

Another advantage of this construction is that\nit is easily generalized for D dimensions. 2) A novel method based on D\ncolorings of the D-dimensional space for constructing D-dimensional codes\ncorrecting D-dimensional cluster-error of various shapes.
