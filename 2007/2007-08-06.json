But\nquantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to\nBell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and\nlocality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like\nseparated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments\nwith entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum\npredictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining\nrealism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction\nof 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and\nexperiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic\ntheories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations.\nIn the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two\nentangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality\nproposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories.

However, ascorbic\nacid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and\nindomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic\nacid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal\nprostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1).
