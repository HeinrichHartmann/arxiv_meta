These data show\nthat SN 2005gj is the second clear case, after SN 2002ic, of a thermonuclear\nexplosion in a dense circumstellar environment. Both the presence of singly and\ndoubly ionized iron-peak elements (FeIII and weak SII, SiII) near maximum light\nas well as the spectral evolution show that SN 2002ic-like events are Type Ia\nexplosions. Independent evidence comes from the exponential decay in luminosity\nof SN 2005gj, pointing to an exponential density distribution of the ejecta.\nThe interaction of the supernova ejecta with the dense circumstellar medium is\nstronger than in SN 2002ic: (1) the supernova lines are weaker; (2) the Balmer\nemission lines are more luminous; and (3) the bolometric luminosity is higher\nclose to maximum light.

How to\norganize a selfstabilizing propagation of information with feedback. From the\nAngluin impossibility results, we cannot elect a leader in a general anonymous\nnetwork. Thus, it is impossible to build a rooted spanning tree. Many problems\ncan only be solved by probabilistic methods. In this paper we show how to use\nUnison to design a self-stabilizing barrier synchronization in an anonymous\nnetwork. We show that the commuication structure of this barrier\nsynchronization designs a self-stabilizing wave-stream, or pipelining wave, in\nanonymous networks. We introduce two variants of Wave: the strong waves and the\nwavelets. A strong wave can be used to solve the idempotent r-operator\nparametrized computation problem. A wavelet deals with k-distance computation.\nWe show how to use Unison to design a self-stabilizing wave stream, a\nself-stabilizing strong wave stream and a self-stabilizing wavelet stream.\n"]}]
