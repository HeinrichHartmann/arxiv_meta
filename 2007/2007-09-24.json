In the process, we demonstrate that the bar modes in stellar\nsystems and the m=2 I-modes in gaseous systems have many common physical\ncharacteristics and only one substantial difference: because of the anisotropy\nof the stress tensor, dynamical instability sets in at lower rotation in\nstellar systems. This difference is reflected also in the new stability\ncriterion. The new stability parameter \"alpha\" is formulated first for\nuniformly rotating systems and is based on the angular momentum content rather\nthan on the energy content of a system. For stability of stellar systems\n\"alpha\" = 0.254-0.258, while it is in the range of 0.341-0.354 for gaseous\nsystems. For uniform rotation, one can write \"alpha\" as a function of the total\n(rotational) kinetic and gravitational energies, and of a parameter which is\ncharacteristic of the topology/connectedness and the geometric shape of a\nsystem. \"Alpha\" can be extended to and calculated for a variety of\ndifferentially rotating, gaseous and stellar, axisymmetric disk and spheroidal\nmodels whose equilibrium structures and stability characteristics are known.

For instance, it is\nknown that $k$-colorability of a graph $G$ is equivalent to the condition $1\n\\in I_{G,k}$ for a certain ideal $I_{G,k} \\subseteq \\k[x_1, ..., x_n]$. In this\npaper, we extend this result by proving a general decomposition theorem for\n$I_{G,k}$. This theorem allows us to give an algebraic characterization of\nuniquely $k$-colorable graphs. Our results also give algorithms for testing\nunique colorability. As an application, we verify a counterexample to a\nconjecture of Xu concerning uniquely 3-colorable graphs without triangles.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 2 figures, print version, to appear J. Comb. Th.

We also extend to\nCohen-Macaulay schemes the criterion of Bondal and Orlov for an integral\nfunctor to be fully faithful in characteristic zero and give a different\ncriterion which is valid in arbitrary characteristic.
