In the first part, the\nmathematical foundation will be built. It will be shown that the spectra of MUB\nhave complete information for the correlation matrixes of finite discrete\nsignals, and the nice properties of them. Roughly speaking, it will be shown\nthat each spectrum from MUB plays an equal role for finite discrete signals,\nand the effect between any two spectra can be treated as a global constant\nshift. These properties will be used to find some important and natural\ncharacterizations of random vectors and random discrete operators/filters.

The main difference with other\nZ-matrix-like coordinates normally used in the literature is that normal\ndihedral angles (``principal dihedrals'' in this work) are only used to fix the\norientation of whole groups and a somewhat non-standard type of dihedrals,\ntermed ``phase dihedrals'', are used to describe the covalent structure inside\nthe groups. This physical approach allows to approximately separate soft and\nhard movements of the molecule using only topological information and to\ndirectly implement constraints. As an application, we use the coordinates\ndefined and ab initio quantum mechanical calculations to assess the commonly\nassumed approximation of the free energy, obtained from ``integrating out'' the\nside chain degree of freedom chi, by the Potential Energy Surface (PES) in the\nprotected dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2. We also present a sub-box of the Hessian\nmatrix in two different sets of coordinates to illustrate the approximate\nseparation of soft and hard movements when the coordinates defined in this work\nare used.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 10 figures, LaTeX, mcite package"]}]

In this work, we explicitly write the determinant of the\nmass-metric tensor G and of the reduced mass-metric tensor g, for any molecule,\ngeneral internal coordinates and arbitrary constraints, as a product of two\nfunctions; one depending only on the external coordinates that describe the\noverall translation and rotation of the system, and the other only on the\ninternal coordinates. This work extends previous results in the literature,\nproving with full generality that one may integrate out the external\ncoordinates and perform Monte Carlo simulations in the internal conformational\nspace of macromolecules. In addition, we give a general mathematical argument\nshowing that the factorization is a consequence of the symmetries of the metric\ntensors involved. Finally, the determinant of the mass-metric tensor G is\ncomputed explicitly in a set of curvilinear coordinates specially well-suited\nfor general branched molecules.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 2 figures, LaTeX, AMSTeX. v2: Introduccion slightly\n  extended.

This work studies the effects\nof such constraints on the Conformational Equilibrium Distribution (CED) of the\nmodel dipeptide HCO-L-Ala-NH2 without any simplifying assumption. We use ab\ninitio Quantum Mechanics calculations including electron correlation at the MP2\nlevel to describe the system, and we measure the conformational dependence of\nall the correcting terms to the naive CED based in the Potential Energy Surface\n(PES) that appear when the constraints are considered. These terms are related\nto mass-metric tensors determinants and also occur in the Fixman's compensating\npotential. We show that some of the corrections are non-negligible if one is\ninterested in the whole Ramachandran space. On the other hand, if only the\nenergetically lower region, containing the principal secondary structure\nelements, is assumed to be relevant, then, all correcting terms may be\nneglected up to peptides of considerable length. This is the first time, as far\nas we know, that the analysis of the conformational dependence of these\ncorrecting terms is performed in a relevant biomolecule with a realistic\npotential energy function.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 4 figures, LaTeX, BibTeX, AMSTeX"]}]
