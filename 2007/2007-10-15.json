By defining a more general initial state in inflation particular\nproperties of the power spectrum such as oscillation can be revealed. The\nbehavior of the power spectrum is shown to exhibit a step-like variation with\nrespect to finite inflation length in cases of both radiation- and scalar\nmatter-dominated pre-inflation. The power spectrum is shown to oscillate in the\nradiation-dominated case. The effects of such a power spectrum on the TT and TE\npower spectra are examined for three typical slow-roll inflation models; a\nsmall-field model, a large field model, and a hybrid model, considering both\npre-inflation models. It is found that the discrepancies between WMAP3 data and\nthe Lambda CDM model, such as suppression of the spectrum at l=2, may be\nexplained to a certain extent by the finite length of inflation for inflation\nof close to 60 e-folds. The small-field inflation model with scalar\nmatter-dominated pre-inflation provides the best fit to the WMAP3 data among\nthe models considered. Relatively large changes in the angular TT power\nspectrum occur in response to small changes in inflation length in the\nradiation-dominated pre-inflation models, and half cases do not fit well with\nthe observed data. This behavior is considered to be attributable to the\noscillatory behavior of the power spectrum.

Each\nnode in the network is located on a point in a two dimensional grid, and\nwhenever a node sends a message, all awake nodes within distance r receive the\nmessage. In the broadcast problem, some node wants to successfully send a\nmessage to all other nodes in the network even when up to a 1/2 fraction of the\nnodes within every neighborhood can be deleted by an adversary. The set of\ndeleted nodes is carefully chosen by the adversary to foil our algorithm and\nmoreover, the set of deleted nodes may change periodically. This models\nworst-case behavior due to mobile nodes, static nodes losing power or simply\nsome points in the grid being unoccupied. A trivial solution requires each node\nin the network to be awake roughly 1/2 the time, and a trivial lower bound\nshows that each node must be awake for at least a 1/n fraction of the time. Our\nfirst result is an algorithm that requires each node to be awake for only a\n1/sqrt(n) fraction of the time in expectation.
