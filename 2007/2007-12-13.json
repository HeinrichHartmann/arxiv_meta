Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction\ntechniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on\nthe raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum)\nsetting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of\ndifferent techniques are known and proven to work.\n  We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the\nclassical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness\nextraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our\nresult allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the\nquantum setting.

We show how to\nencrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure\nagainst a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum\nuncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure\nencryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show\nhow to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum\nattacker. Such a technique is useful in settings where the raw key may contain\nerrors, since standard error-correction techniques may provide the attacker\nwith information on, say, a secret key that was used to obtain the raw key.\n","Comment: 17 pages, v2: mainly editorial changes taking into account referee\n  comments"]}]

BoE beats prior methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.\nWhile the computation procedure of BoE is simple, explaining why it works is by\nno means trivial.

This paper models an\nideal CSMA network as a set of interacting on-off telegraph processes. In\ndeveloping the theory, we discovered a number of analytical techniques and\nobservations that have eluded prior research, such as that the carrier-sensing\ninteractions among links in an ideal CSMA network result in a system state\nevolution that is time-reversible; and that the probability distribution of the\nsystem state is insensitive to the distributions of the \"on\" and \"off\"\ndurations given their means, and is a Markov random field.

Our framework represents an attempt to articulate a a global perspective on\nthe late stages of stellar evolution that can embrace both the nature of the\ncentral engine and the outflows they produce. Our framework focuses on\ninteracting binary central stars which drive collimated outflows through MHD\nprocesses. We propose that the field of AGB/PN studies now faces a \"Grand\nChallenge\" in articulating the observational systematics of these objects in a\nway that can address issues related to binarity and magnetic shaping. A\ntheoretical Grand Challenge is also faced in the form of integrated studies\nwhich can explicate the highly non-linear processes associated with MHD\noutflows driven by interacting binaries. These issues include the generation of\nmagnetic fields via dynamo processes, the creation of accretion disks, the\ndynamics of Common Envelope ejection and the creation of magnetized jets.\n","Comment: 5 Pages, Aspherical PNe IV"]}]
