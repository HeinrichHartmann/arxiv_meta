In general terms, this problem may be phrased as follows: given a\nfield $k$, a $k$-variety $X$, and a class $\\alpha \\in \\Br(k)$, compute the\nindex of the class $\\alpha_{k(X)} \\in \\Br(X)$ obtained from $\\alpha$ by\nextension of scalars to $k(X)$. We give a general method for computing index\nreduction which refines classical results of Schofield and van den Bergh. When\n$X$ is a curve of genus 1, we use Atiyah's theorem on the structure of stable\nvector bundles with integral slope to show that our formula simplifies\ndramatically, giving a complete solution to the index reduction problem in this\ncase. Using the twisted Fourier-Mukai transform, we show that a similarly\nsimple formula describes homogeneous index reduction on torsors under\nhigher-dimensional abelian varieties.\n","Comment: 18 pages.

We present a rigorous analytical treatment of these models\nand show that they may yield results that are in exact agreement with quantum\ntheory.
