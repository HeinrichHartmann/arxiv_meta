A near-ideal\nmodel of the invisibility cloak is set up to solve the boundary problem at the\ninner boundary of the cloak shell. We confirm that a cloak with the ideal\nmaterial parameters is a perfect invisibility cloak by systematically studying\nthe change of the scattering coefficients from the near-ideal case to the ideal\none. However, due to the slow convergence of the zero$^{th}$ order scattering\ncoefficients, a tiny perturbation on the cloak would induce a noticeable field\nscattering and penetration.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Even in the absence of non-trivial integrals of motion, there exist\ninvariant differential forms: a symplectic two-form, or a contact one-form for\ngeodesic flows. Some invariant forms can be naturally considered as \"forms on\nthe quotient.\" As a space, this quotient may be very bad in the conventional\ntopological sense.

The\ncohomology theory for quotients, called \"basic cohomology\" in the literature,\nappears naturally in our approach. We define also new exotic cohomology groups\nassociated with the so-called cohomological equation in dynamical systems and\nfind exact sequences connecting them with the cohomology of quotients.
