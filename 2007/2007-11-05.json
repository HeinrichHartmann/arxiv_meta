We note that most\nsuch systems are subject to multiple structural and functional constraints,\ne.g., minimizing the average path length and the total number of links, while\nmaximizing robustness against perturbations in node activity. We show that the\noptimal networks satisfying these three constraints are characterized by the\nexistence of multiple subnetworks (modules) sparsely connected to each other.\nIn addition, these modules have distinct hubs, resulting in an overall\nheterogeneous degree distribution.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures; Published version"]}]

To answer this question, we need a technology to disassemble proteins\nonto elementary func-tional details and to prepare lumped description of such\ndetails. This lumped description might have a multiple material realization (in\namino acids). Our hypothesis is that informational approach to this problem is\npossible. We propose a way of hierarchical classification that makes the\nprimary structure of protein maximally non-random. The first steps of the\nsuggested research program are realized: the method and the analysis of optimal\ninformational protein binary alphabet. The general method is used to answer\nseveral specific questions, for example: (i) Is there a syntactic difference\nbetween Globular and Membrane proteins? (ii) Are proteins random sequences of\namino acids (a long discussion)? For these questions, the answers are as\nfollows: (i) There exists significant syntactic difference between Globular and\nMembrane proteins, and this difference is described; (ii) Amino acid sequences\nin proteins are definitely not random.\n","Comment: 13 p. 6 Tabs, 3 Figs, Reduced version with additional study of\n  membrane and globular proteins"]}]
