The main emphasis is on the\nenergetics of the trapping process including the interplay between the positron\nstate and the defect's ionic structure and on the ensuing annihilation\ncharacteristics of the trapped state. For vacancies in covalent semiconductors\nthe ion relaxation is a crucial part of the positron trapping process enabling\nthe localization of the positron state. However, positron trapping does not\nstrongly affect the characteristic features of the electronic structure, e.g.,\nthe ionization levels change only moderately. Also in the case of metal\nvacancies the positron-induced ion relaxation has a noticeable effect on the\ncalculated positron lifetime and momentum distribution of annihilating\nelectron-positron pairs.\n","Comment: Submitted to Physical Review B on 17 April 2007.

In this paper we construct two\nsimple analytical theories for the structural properties of PS fluids: a\nlow-temperature (LT) approximation, that can be seen as an extension to PSs of\nthe well-known solution of the Percus-Yevick (PY) equation for hard spheres,\nand a high-temperature (HT) approximation based on the exact asymptotic\nbehavior in the limit of infinite temperature. Monte Carlo simulations for a\nwide range of temperatures and densities are performed to assess the validity\nof both theories. It is found that, despite their simplicity, the HT and LT\napproximations exhibit a fair agreement with the simulation data within their\nrespective domains of applicability, so that they complement each other. A\ncomparison with numerical solutions of the PY and the hypernetted-chain\napproximations is also carried out, the latter showing a very good performance,\nexcept inside the core at low temperatures.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures; v2: some figures redone; small changes"]}]
