The study of diffusion on such networks is\nmotivated by transport on randomly folded polymer chains, synchronization\nproblems in task-completion networks, and gradient driven transport on\nnetworks. Changing the parameters of the distance-dependence, we found a rich\nphase diagram, with different transient and recurrent phases in the context of\nrandom walks on networks. We performed the calculations in two limiting cases:\nin the annealed case, where the rearrangement of the random links is fast, and\nin the quenched case, where the link rearrangement is slow compared to the\nmotion of the random walker or the surface. It has been well-established that\nin a large class of interacting systems, adding an arbitrarily small density\nof, possibly long-range, quenched random links to a regular lattice interaction\ntopology, will give rise to mean-field (or annealed) like behavior. In some\ncases, however, mean-field scaling breaks down, such as in diffusion or in the\nEdwards-Wilkinson process in \"low-dimensional\" small-world networks. This\nbreak-down can be understood by treating the random links perturbatively, where\nthe mean-field (or annealed) prediction appears as the lowest-order term of a\nnaive perturbation expansion. The asymptotic analytic results are also\nconfirmed numerically by employing exact numerical diagonalization of the\nnetwork Laplacian. Further, we construct a finite-size scaling framework for\nthe relevant observables, capturing the cross-over behaviors in finite\nnetworks.

We model such interactions as Bayesian interference\ngames. Each wireless device selects a power profile over the entire available\nbandwidth to maximize its data rate. Such competitive models represent\nsituations in which several wireless devices share spectrum without any central\nauthority or coordinated protocol.\n  In contrast to games where devices have complete information about their\nopponents, we consider scenarios where the devices are unaware of the\ninterference they cause to other devices. Such games, which are modeled as\nBayesian games, can exhibit significantly different equilibria. We first\nconsider a simple scenario of simultaneous move games, where we show that the\nunique Bayes-Nash equilibrium is where both devices spread their power equally\nacross the entire bandwidth. We then extend this model to a two-tiered spectrum\nsharing case where users act sequentially. Here one of the devices, called the\nprimary user, is the owner of the spectrum and it selects its power profile\nfirst. The second device (called the secondary user) then responds by choosing\na power profile to maximize its Shannon capacity. In such sequential move\ngames, we show that there exist equilibria in which the primary user obtains a\nhigher data rate by using only a part of the bandwidth.\n  In a repeated Bayesian interference game, we show the existence of reputation\neffects: an informed primary user can bluff to prevent spectrum usage by a\nsecondary user who suffers from lack of information about the channel gains.\nThe resulting equilibrium can be highly inefficient, suggesting that\ncompetitive spectrum sharing is highly suboptimal.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 3 figures"]}]

While the majority of the field\nenergy in the honeycomb photonic bandgap fibers is found to reside in the\nsilica, a substantial fraction (up to ~30%) can be located in the airholes.\nThis property may show such fibers particularly interesting for sensor\napplications, especially those based on nonlinear effects or interaction with\nother structures (e.g. Bragg gratings) in the glass.\n","Comment: Accepted for J.
