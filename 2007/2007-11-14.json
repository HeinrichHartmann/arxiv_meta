We use the lower bound for finding\nthe least distortion for Hamming graphs, Johnson graphs, and all strongly\nregular graphs. Our technique involves semidefinite programming and exploiting\nthe algebra structure of the optimization problem so that the question of\nfinding a lower bound of the least distortion is reduced to an analytic\nquestion about orthogonal polynomials.\n","Comment: 10 pages, (v3) some corrections, accepted in Journal of Combinatorial\n  Theory, Series B"]}]
