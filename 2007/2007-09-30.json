Our analytical fomulae, which take full\naccount of Zeeman splitting, are used to analyse recent magnetic-focusing data.\nSurprisingly, it turns out that the Rashba effect can dominate the splitting of\ncyclotron orbits even when the Rashba and Zeeman spin-splitting energies are of\nthe same order. We also find that the origin of spin-dependent cyclotron motion\ncan be traced back to Zitterbewegung-like oscillatory dynamics of charge\ncarriers from spin-split bands. The relation between the two phenomena is\ndiscussed, and we estimate the effect of Zitterbewegung-related corrections to\nthe charge carriers' canonical position.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 2 figures, IOP style, v2: minor changes, to appear in NJP\n  Focus Issue on Spintronics"]}]
