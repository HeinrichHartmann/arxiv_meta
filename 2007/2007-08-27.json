We also provide a\ncharacterization of the set of transitivity of the control sets: its elements\nare the fixed points of type w for a regular hyperbolic isometry, where w is an\nelement of the Weyl group of $G$.

The remainder term has an\nasymptotic expansion, and for a typical analytic function, it is a divergent\n(Gevrey-1) series. Under some decay assumptions of the function in a half-plane\n(resp. in the vertical strip containing the summation interval), Hardy (resp.\nAbel-Plana) prove that the asymptotic expansion is a Borel summable series, and\ngive an exact Euler-MacLaurin summation formula.\n  Using a mild resurgence hypothesis for the function to be summed, we give a\nBorel summable transseries expression for the remainder term, as well as a\nLaplace integral formula, with an explicit integrand which is a resurgent\nfunction itself. In particular, our summation formula allows for resurgent\nfunctions with singularities in the vertical strip containing the summation\ninterval.\n  Finally, we give two applications of our results. One concerns the\nconstruction of solutions of linear difference equations with a small\nparameter. And another concerns the problem of proving resurgence of formal\npower series associated to knotted objects.\n","Comment: AMS-LaTeX, 15 pages with 2 figures"]}]
