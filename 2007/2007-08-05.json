Analysis performed in the present paper shows that\nthere exists an intrinsic symmetry of TMT which emerges in the $\\Lambda =0$\nground state. This symmetry contains a subgroup of reflections of the metric\n$g_{\\mu\\nu}\\to -g_{\\mu\\nu}$ studied recently by a number of authors as the\nsymmetry imposing zero CC. We show that realization of this idea in TMT is free\nof fine tuning and has no problems typical to other approaches.\n","Comment: 4 text pages and one page with 2 figures; text slightly improved; a\n  reference added"]}]

In these cases, the leading supergravity\ngeometry is singular, but higher order corrections remove this singularity in a\nway that is consistent with, for example the non-zero entropy for the black\nholes that these strings form after wrapping on an additional circle. The\nconformal field theories have the right structure to capture the features of\nthe supergravity analysis, and possess precisely the microscopic target spaces\nrequired. We describe in detail the model with AdS_3 X S^2 geometry, which is\nconjectured by Lapan et. al. to represent a fundamental heterotic string in\nfive dimensions, and then propose conformal field theories which are potential\ncandidates for the microscopic geometry of heterotic strings in $D$ dimensions,\nwith target space AdS_3 X S^{D-3}. We also discuss some conformal field\ntheories that give microscopic AdS target spaces in various dimensions.\n","Comment: 14 pages, v2: typos corrected and references added.

We reexamine this interpretation and note that the decrease in the\nrotation period is also consistent with a solidification of a small liquid-like\ncomponent into a low-temperature glass. Such a solidification may occur by a\nlow-temperature quench of topological defects (e.g., grain boundaries or\ndislocations) which we examined in an earlier work. The low-temperature glass\ncan account for not only a monotonic decrease in the rotation period as the\ntemperature is lowered but also explains the peak in the dissipation occurring\nnear the transition point. Unlike the non-classical rotational inertia\nscenario, which depends on the supersolid fraction, the dependence of the\nrotational period on external parameters, e.g., the oscillator velocity,\nprovides an alternate interpretation of the oscillator experiments. Future\nexperiments might explore this effect.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures; to appear in Phys. Rev. B"]}]
