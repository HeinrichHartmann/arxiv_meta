The tunneling conductance of an\nn-p-n junction initially increases upon lowering the temperature, while the\ncoherence time of the electron-hole pairs is still less than their lifetime,\nbut then drops back again when the coherence time exceeds the lifetime. This\nreentrance effect, known from diffusive conductors and ballistic quantum dots,\nprovides a method to detect phase coherent Klein tunneling of electron-hole\npairs.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Building on an\napplication of this method to the classical zonotope shellings we describe a\nclass of maximum acyclic matchings for the Salvetti complex of a linear\ncomplexified arrangement. To do this, we introduce and study a new\ncombinatorial stratification of the Salvetti complex. For the obtained acyclic\nmatchings we give an explicit description of the critical cells that depends\nonly on the chosen linear extension of the poset of regions. It is always\npossible to choose the linear extension so that the critical cells can be\nexplicitly constructed from the chambers of the arrangement via the bijection\nto no-broken-circuit sets defined by Jewell and Orlik. Our method can be\ngeneralized to arbitraty oriented matroids.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 9 figures. Examples and figures added, corrections/changes\n  in section 4"]}]
