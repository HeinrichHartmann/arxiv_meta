A number of studies, aimed at its experimental verification, have found\nadequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations,\nhowever, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model\nfor describing the Trivers-Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly\ncomplex. The present study describes a minimal population genetic model to\nexplore one specific scenario, viz. how is the preference for a male offspring\nby females in good condition altered when 'g', the proportion of such females\nin the population changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the\nproportion of such females is low, i.e., for low values of 'g', the\nTrivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment\nstrategy. This holds true up to gmax, a critical value of 'g', above which the\ntwo strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily\ndecreases as 'g' increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed\nmales attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced,\nthe TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of\nthe TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance in the physiological\ncondition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not\nlarge, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the\ndifference increases. However, beyond a critical value of the difference, the\nTW strategy is found to be less and less likely to succeed as the difference\nbecomes larger.

Rather, we find that the low-energy excitations of\nthis material are antiferromagnetic magnons gapped by single-ion and dipolar\nanisotropy effects, and that the lowest temperature of 350 mK considered in\nprevious specific heat measurements accidentally happens to coincide with a\ncrossover temperature below which magnons become thermally activated and Cv\ntakes an exponential form. We argue that further specific heat measurements\nthat extend down to at least 100 mK are required in order to ascribe an\nunconventional description of magnetic excitations out of the ground state of\nGd2Sn2O7 or to invalidate the standard picture of gapped excitations proposed\nherein.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures; shortened introduction and added 1 figure"]}]

First we show, in the general case of\nasymmetric interactions, the existence of a strategy that allows any player to\neliminate losses after a finite random time. In the special case of symmetric\ninteractions, we also prove that, as time goes to infinity, the game converges\nto a Nash equilibrium. Moreover, assuming that all agents adopt the same\nstrategy, using arguments related to those leading to perfect simulation\nalgorithms, spatial mixing and ergodicity are proved. In turn, ergodicity\nallows us to prove ``fixation'', i.e. that players will adopt a constant\nstrategy after a finite time. The resulting dynamics is related to\nzero-temperature Glauber dynamics on random graphs of possibly infinite volume.\n","Comment: 17 pages"]}]
