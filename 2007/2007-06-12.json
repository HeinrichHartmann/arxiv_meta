Even if only\na single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small\npopulations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational\nstate, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the\nexcitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a\nnon-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The\nmeasurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave\nmixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An\nimportant point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of\nmolecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming\nlaser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration\nlaser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are\nrecorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the\nconstant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of\nthe excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have\nsufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of\nthe same levels.

We generalise this technique for bounding the mixing time of systematic\nscan to block dynamics, a setting in which a (constant size) set of sites are\nupdated simultaneously. In particular we consider the parameter alpha,\ncorresponding to the maximum influence on any site, and show that if alpha<1\nthen the corresponding systematic scan Markov chain mixes rapidly. As\napplications of this method we prove O(log n) mixing of systematic scan (for\nany scan order) for heat-bath updates of edges for proper q-colourings of a\ngeneral graph with maximum vertex-degree Delta when q>=2Delta.
