For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity\nquantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental\nadvances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by\ntrapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been\nachieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground\nstate of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates\n(BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have\nbeen reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained\nan elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by\ncombining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This\nallows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the\nnew situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly\ncoupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned\ndeterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a\nsingle antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a\ncontrolled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the\nheating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the\ncoupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The\nspectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range\nof atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings\nexceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we\nattribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.\n","Comment: 20 pages.
