Using\nthe structure function the partial thermal capacity and partial heat resistance\nof certain elements of the thermal system can be identified. If the geometrical\nmeasurements of a thermal system of simple geometry and homogeneous material\n(such as a homogeneous rod or board, etc.) are known, the coefficient of\nthermal conductivity of the material in question can be determined from two\npoints of the structure function at 2-5 per cent of accuracy. In this paper a\nmethod is presented which applies a wide range/section instead of two points of\nthe cumulative structure function to determine the thermal coefficient, thus\nreducing the subjective error deriving from the selection of the two points.\nThe above method is presented and illustrated in simulated as well as measured\nthermal transient responses.\n","Comment: Submitted on behalf of TIMA Editions\n  (http://irevues.inist.fr/tima-editions)"]}]

This study is based on a model appropriate for such a\ncase, that we have introduced recently [Phys. Rev. B 73, 220501(R) (2006)]. We\nargue that in the two-band superconductor MgB_2 such a case is realised.\nMotivated by the experimental findings on MgB_2, we assume that\nsuperconductivity in the diffusive band is ``weak'', i.e., mostly induced. We\nexamine intriguing features of the order parameter, the current density, and\nthe vortex core spectrum in the ``strong'' ballistic band under the influence\nof hybridization with the ``weak'' diffusive band. Although the order parameter\nin the diffusive band is induced, the characteristic length scales in the two\nbands differ due to Coulomb interactions. The current density in the vortex\ncore is dominated by the contribution from the ballistic band, while outside\nthe core the contribution from the diffusive band can be substantial, or even\ndominating. The current density in the diffusive band has strong temperature\ndependence, exhibiting the Kramer-Pesch effect when hybridization is strong. A\nparticularly interesting feature of our model is the possibility of additional\nbound states near the gap edge in the ballistic band, that are prominent in the\nvortex centre spectra. This contrasts with the single band case, where there is\nno gap-edge bound state in the vortex centre.
