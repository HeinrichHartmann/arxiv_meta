In experimental realizations, when a leg\ndetaches from a segment of the surface for the first time it alters that\nsegment, and legs subsequently bound to these altered segments more weakly.\nInspired by these experiments we investigate spiders moving along a\none-dimensional substrate, whose legs leave newly visited sites at a slower\nrate than revisited sites. For a random walk (one-leg spider) the slowdown does\nnot effect the long time behavior. For a bipedal spider, however, the slowdown\ngenerates an effective bias towards unvisited sites, and the spider behaves\nsimilarly to the excited walk. Surprisingly, the slowing down of the spider at\nnew sites increases the diffusion coefficient and accelerates the growth of the\nnumber of visited sites.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The main result\nstates that if there exists an n-times continuously differentiable Lyapunov\nfunction which proves exponential stability on a bounded subset of R^n, then\nthere exists a polynomial Lyapunov function which proves exponential stability\non the same region. Such a continuous Lyapunov function will exist if, for\nexample, the right-hand side of the differential equation is polynomial or at\nleast n-times continuously differentiable. The proof is based on a\ngeneralization of the Weierstrass approximation theorem to differentiable\nfunctions in several variables. Specifically, we show how to use polynomials to\napproximate a differentiable function in the Sobolev norm W^{1,\\infty} to any\ndesired accuracy. We combine this approximation result with the second-order\nTaylor series expansion to find that polynomial Lyapunov functions can\napproximate continuous Lyapunov functions arbitrarily well on bounded sets.

We show that, despite these limitations, entanglement can be\nfully 'promiscuous', i.e. simultaneously present in unlimited two-body and\nmany-body forms in states living in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.\nMonogamy just bounds the divergence rate of the various entanglement\ncontributions.

Such a finding is of importance for the\nquantification, understanding and potential exploitation of shared quantum\ncorrelations in continuous variable systems. We discuss how promiscuity\ngradually arises when considering simple families of discrete variable states,\nwith increasing Hilbert space dimension towards the continuous variable limit.\nSuch models are somehow analogous to Gaussian states with asymptotically\ndiverging, but finite squeezing. In this respect, we find that non-Gaussian\nstates (which in general are more entangled than Gaussian states), exhibit also\nthe interesting feature that their entanglement is more shareable: in the\nnon-Gaussian multipartite arena, unlimited promiscuity can be already achieved\namong three entangled parties, while this is impossible for Gaussian, even\ninfinitely squeezed states.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures.
