The conventional assignment of spin 0 to the pseudoscalar state is called\ninto question by the proximity of a spin 4 state in the model, which motivates\ncalculating the mass of the spin 4 state on the lattice. Novel lattice\noperators are constructed from a matrix of effective Greens functions which\nattempt to overcome the lattice rotational ambiguities. Correlation functions\nare presented for the channels with even J, and effective masses extracted. The\nresulting masses compare well with the extended Isgur-Paton model.\n","Comment: 152 pages, 78 figures, 31 tables, doctoral thesis Oxford 2001"]}]

Robust sticking mechanisms that would produce\nplanetesimals by coagulation alone remain elusive. The gravitational collapse\nof smaller solids into planetesimals is opposed by stirring from turbulent gas.\nThis proceeding describes recent works showing that \"particle feedback,\" the\nback-reaction of drag forces on the gas in protoplanetary disks, promotes\nparticle clumping as seeds for gravitational collapse. The idealized streaming\ninstability demonstrates the basic ability of feedback to generate particle\noverdensities. More detailed numerical simulations show that the particle\noverdensities produced in turbulent flows trigger gravitational collapse to\nplanetesimals.

A compiler supports a high level application definition in\na programming language. An operating system supports a high level interface to\nthe resources used by an application execution. A Task System and Item\nArchitecture (TSIA) provides an application with a transparent reliable,\ndistributed, heterogeneous, adaptive, dynamic, real-time, interactive,\nparallel, secure or other execution. In addition to supporting the application\nexecution, a TSIA also supports the application definition. This run-time\nsupport for the definition is complementary to the compile-time support of a\ncompiler. For example, this allows a language similar to Fortran or C to\ndeliver features promised by functional computing. While many TSIAs exist, they\npreviously have not been recognized as such and have served only a particular\ntype of application. Existing TSIAs and other projects demonstrate that TSIAs\nare feasible for most applications. As the next paradigm for application\nsupport, the TSIA simplifies and unifies existing computing practice and\nresearch. By solving many outstanding problems, the TSIA opens many, many new\nopportunities for computing.\n","Comment: 20 pages including 13 figures of diagrams and code examples.
