For this we have performed self-consistent\ncalculations, by solving three time-dependent kinetic equations for protons,\nelectrons and photons in addition to the usual mass and energy conservation\nequations. We follow the evolution of the RBW as it sweeps up circumstellar\nmatter and assume that the swept-up electrons and protons have energies equal\nto the Lorentz factor of the flow. While the electrons radiate their energies\nthrough synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation on short timescales, the\nprotons, at least initially, start accumulating without any dissipation. As the\naccumulated mass of relativistic protons increases, however, they can become\nsupercritical to the `proton-photon pair-production - synchrotron radiation'\nnetwork, and, as a consequence, they transfer explosively their stored energy\nto secondary electron-positron pairs and radiation. This results in a burst\nwhich has many features similar to the ones observed in GRB prompt emission. We\nhave included in our calculations the radiation drag force exerted on the flow\nfrom the scattered radiation of the prompt emission on the circumstellar\nmaterial. We find that this can decelerate the flow on timescales which are\nmuch faster than the ones related to the usual adiabatic/radiative ones.

In the absence of an external driving field, the model\ngenerates a time independent ergodic equilibrium state with two conjugate pairs\nof Lyapunov exponents. Each conjugate pair sums to zero. The fluctuation\nrelations are tested numerically both near and far from equilibrium. As\nexpected from previous work, near equilibrium the ESFR is verified by the\nsimulation data while the GCFR is not confirmed by the data. Far from\nequilibrium where a positive exponent in one of these conjugate pairs becomes\nnegative, we test a conjecture regarding the GCFR made by Gallavotti and\nco-workers. They conjectured that where the number of nontrivial Lyapunov\nexponents that are positive becomes less than the number of such negative\nexponents, then the form of the GCFR needs to be corrected. We show that there\nis no evidence for this conjecture in the empirical data. In fact as the field\nincreases, the uncorrected form of the GCFR appears to become more accurate.\nThe real reason for this observation is likely to be that as the field\nincreases, the argument of the GCFR more and more accurately approximates the\nargument of the ESFR. Since the ESFR works for arbitrary field strengths, the\nuncorrected GCFR appears to become ever more accurate as the field increases.\nThe final point of evidence against the conjecture is that when the smallest\npositive exponent changes sign, the conjecture predicts a discontinuous change\nin the \"correction factor\" for GCFR. We see no evidence for a discontinuity at\nthis field strength; only a gradual improvement of degree of agreement as the\nfield increases.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 5 figures"]}]
