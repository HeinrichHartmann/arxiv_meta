In\nthe low-binding energy region, we found two energy bands, one dispersing along\nthe (100) sample surface and the other along the normal to the surface. Through\na detailed polarization-dependent analysis, we have determined the symmetries\nof the two bands. The initial states associated with the band that disperses\nalong the surface are dominantly odd with respect to the (110) mirror plane and\neven with respect to the (010) mirror plane.

Using state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations we show\nthat when Mn atoms migrate to sites occupied in the perfect alloys by Co, these\nMn atoms have spin moments antiparallel to the other transition metal atoms.\nThe ferrimagnetic compounds, which result from this procedure, keep the\nhalf-metallic character of the parent compounds and the large\nexchange-splitting of the Mn impurities atoms only marginally affects the width\nof the gap in the minority-spin band. The case of [Co$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$]$_2$MnSi is\nof particular interest since Mn$_3$Si is known to crystallize in the Heusler\n$L2_1$ lattice structure of Co$_2$MnZ compounds.

Dead objects that are\nreachable from program variables are not reclaimed.\n  In this paper we describe our experiments to measure the effectiveness of\ngarbage collection in MIT/GNU Scheme.

The\nnumber of dead objects and the drag time together indicate opportunities for\nimproving garbage collection. Our experiments reveal that up to 26% of dead\nobjects remain in memory.
