We find\nthat the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system\nsize, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system\nsize do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological\nentropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any\ninfinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as\nthe temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced\nby a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of\nenergy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold\nat small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the\ntopological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt\nthe magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic\ncharges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic\nand electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological\nentropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loop\nstructure \\emph{per se} is a classical object, we interpret the quantum\ntopological order in our system as arising from the ability of the two\nstructures to be superimposed and appear simultaneously.\n","Comment: (15 pages, 5 figures) v2: updated references and acknowledgments"]}]

The environment and\nits interaction with the qubits are modelled by random matrices. For two\nqubits, numerical studies reveal a simple one to one correspondence between its\ndecoherence and its internal entanglement decay. Using this relation we are\nable to give a formula for concurrence decay. For large environments the\nevolution induces a unital channel in the two qubits, providing a partial\nexplanation for the relation above. Using a kicked Ising spin network, we study\nthe exact evolution of two non-interacting qubits in the presence of a spin\nbath. We find that the entanglement (as measured by concurrence) of the two\nqubits has a close relation to the purity of the pair, and closely follows an\nanalytic relation derived for Werner states. As a collateral result we find\nthat an integrable environment causes quadratic decay of concurrence as well as\nof purity, while a chaotic environment causes linear decay. Both quantities\ndisplay recurrences in some integrable environments. Good agreement with the\nresults found using random matrix theory is obtained. Finally, we analyze\ndecoherence of a quantum register in the absence of non-local operations. The\nproblem is solved in terms of a sum rule which implies linear scaling in the\nnumber of qubits. Each term involves a single qubit and its entanglement with\nthe remaining ones. Two conditions are essential: decoherence must be small and\nthe coupling of different qubits must be uncorrelated in the interaction\npicture. We apply the result to the random matrix model, and illustrate its\nreach considering a GHZ state coupled to a spin bath.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

Within the\ncontext of standard cosmology, the Universe must therefore contain a third\n`dark' component of energy, beyond matter and radiation. However, the current\ndata are still deemed insufficient to distinguish between an evolving dark\nenergy component and the simplest model of a time-independent cosmological\nconstant. In this paper, we examine the role played by our cosmic horizon R0 in\nour interrogation of the data, and reach the rather firm conclusion that the\nexistence of a cosmological constant is untenable. The observations are telling\nus that R0=c t0, where t0 is the perceived current age of the Universe, yet a\ncosmological constant would drive R0 towards ct (where t is the cosmic time)\nonly once, and that would have to occur right now. In contrast, scaling\nsolutions simultaneously eliminate several conundrums in the standard model,\nincluding the `coincidence' and `flatness' problems, and account very well for\nthe fact that R0=c t0. We show here that for such dynamical dark energy models,\neither R0=ct for all time (thus eliminating the apparent coincidence\naltogether), or that what we believe to be the current age of the universe is\nactually the horizon time th=R0/c, which is always shorter than t0. Our best\nfit to the Type Ia supernova data indicates that t0 would then have to be ~16.9\nbillion years. Though surprising at first, an older universe such as this would\nactually eliminate several other long-standing problems in cosmology, including\nthe (too) early appearance of supermassive black holes (at a redshift > 6) and\nthe glaring deficit of dwarf halos in the local group.\n","Comment: Submitted to MNRAS"]}]

We provide reasonable arguments to assess the universality of these\neffects and we propose an empirical method to take them into account.
