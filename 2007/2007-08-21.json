Quantitative tracking of chain\nconformation statistics on the Kuhn scale is essential for developing\ncomputational models of such phenomena. For this purpose, we formulate here a\ntwo-scale/two-mode model of entangled polymer chains under flow. Each chain is\npartitioned by successive entanglements into strands that are in one of two\nmodes: entangled or dangling. On the strand scale, conformation statistics of\nideal (non-interacting) strands follows a differential evolution equation for\nthe second moment of its end-to-end distance. The latter regulates persistent\nrandom walks sampling conformation statistics of ideal entangled strands on the\nKuhn scale, as follows from a generalized Green-Kubo relation and the Maximum\nEntropy Principle. We test it numerically for a range of deformation rates at\nthe start-up of simple elongational and shear flows. A self-consistent\npotential, representing segmental interactions, modifies strand conformation\nstatistics on the Kuhn scale, as it renormalizes the parameters controlling the\npersistent random walk. The generalized Green-Kubo relation is then inverted to\ndetermine how the second moment of the strand end-to-end distance is changed by\nthe self-consistent potential. This allows us to devise a two-scale propagation\nscheme for the statistical weights of subchains of the entangled chain. The\nlatter is used to calculate local volume fractions for each chemical type of\nKuhn segments in entangled chains, thus determining the self-consistent\npotential.\n","Comment: 76 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Caustics are places where the CDM\nparticles are naturally focussed. Our focus is upon the caustic rings which are\nclosed tubes whose cross-section is an elliptic umbilic catastrophe with three\ndual cusps. A caustic ring has a specific density profile, a specific geometry\nand, therefore, precisely calculable gravitational lensing signatures. The\nmagnification monotonically increases as the line of sight approaches to the\ncusps where it diverges in the limit of zero velocity dispersion. In this\nlimit, we find 37% magnification at a sample point near the outer cusps of the\nCDM caustic rings at cosmological distances. In the presence of finite velocity\ndispersion, the lower and upper bounds of the effective velocity dispersions of\nthe axion and WIMP flows in galactic halos may be used to constrain the lensing\neffects at the cusps. For a cosmological axion caustic ring, we find that the\nmagnification may range between 3% and 2800% at the outer cusp, and between 2%\nand 46% at the non-planer cusps. For a cosmological WIMP caustic ring, on the\nother hand, we constrain the magnification between 3% and 28% at the outer\ncusp, and between 2% and 5% at the non-planer cusps. The images of extended\nsources may also show distortions that can be unambiguously attributed to\nlensing by dark matter caustics.

The self-consistent full quantum mechanical\nmagnetotransport calculations within the Hartree, Density Functional Theory and\nThomas-Fermi approximations were performed where a whole device, including the\nsemi-infinitive leads, is treated on the same footing (i.e. the\nelectron-electron interaction is accounted for both in the leads as well as in\nthe dot region). The main finding of the present paper is the effect of pinning\nof the resonant levels to the Fermi energy due to the enhanced screening. Our\nresults represent a significant departure from a conventional picture where a\nvariation of external parameters (such as a gate voltage, magnetic field, etc.)\ncauses the successive dot states to sweep past the Fermi level in a linear\nfashion. We instead demonstrate highly nonlinear behavior of the resonant\nlevels in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The pinning of the resonant levels\nin open quantum dots leads to the broadening of the conduction oscillations in\ncomparison to the one electron picture. The effect of pinning becomes much more\npronounced in the presence of the perpendicular magnetic field. This can be\nattributed to the enhanced screening efficiency because of the increased\nlocalization of the wave function. The strong pinning of the resonant energy\nlevels in the presence of magnetic field can have a profound effect on\ntransport properties of various devices operating in the edge state transport\nregime. We also critically examine an approximation often used in transport\ncalculations where an inherently open system is replaced by a corresponding\nclosed one.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Phys.

The observables are compared to existing $K^+$ and proton data.\nWhile the $K^0$ data agree with previously reported $K^+$ measurements, the\n$\\Lambda$ distributions show a different behavior relative to that of protons.\nThe strangeness balance and the production yield per participating nucleon as a\nfunction of the centrality of the reaction are discussed, for the first time at\nSIS energies.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures"]}]
