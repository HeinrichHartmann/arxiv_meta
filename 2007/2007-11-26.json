A model of aligned hard hexagons has similarities\nwith the hard disk model. Both share \"lost cases\", i.e. admit configurations of\nthree particles in which there is pairwise overlap but not triple overlap.\nThese configurations are known to be problematic for fundamental measure\nfunctionals, which are not able to capture their contribution correctly. This\nfailure lies in the inability of these functionals to yield a correct low\ndensity limit of the third order direct correlation function. Here we derive\nthe functional by projecting aligned hard cubes on the plane x+y+z=0. The\ncorrect dimensional crossover behavior of these functionals permits us to\nfollow this strategy. The functional of aligned hard cubes, however, does not\nhave lost cases, so neither had the resulting functional for aligned hard\nhexagons. The latter exhibits, in fact, a peculiar structure as compared to the\none for hard disks.

However, the mechanisms controlling the\nformation of MCs remain controversial. In this contribution, we focus on their\nformation in compressive flows driven by interstellar turbulence and\nlarge-scale gravitational instability. Turbulent compression driven by\nsupernovae appears insufficient to explain the bulk of cloud and star\nformation. Rather, gravity must be important at all scales, driving the\ncompressive flows that form both clouds and cores. Cooling and thermal\ninstability allow the formation of dense gas out of moderate, transonic\ncompressions in the warm diffuse gas, and drive turbulence into the dense\nclouds. MCs may be produced by an overshoot beyond the thermal-pressure\nequilibrium between the cold and warm phases of atomic gas, caused by some\ncombination of the ram pressure of compression and the self-gravity of the\ncompressed gas. In this case, properties of the clouds such as their mass,\nmass-to-magnetic flux ratio, and total kinetic and gravitational energies are\nin general time-variable quantities. MCs may never enter a quasi-equilibrium or\nvirial equilibrium state but rather continuously collapse to stars.\n","Comment: Proceeding of conference \"Structure formation in the universe\", held\n  in Chamonix 2007.

In this paper, we give\nsufficient and necessary conditions for an algebraic Stein variety to be\naffine. One of our results is that an irreducible quasi-projective variety $Y$\ndefined over $\\mathbb{C}$ with dimension $d$ ($d\\geq 1$) is affine if and only\nif $Y$ is Stein, $H^i(Y, {\\mathcal{O}}_Y)=0$ for all $i>0$ and $\\kappa(D, X)=\nd$ (i.e., $D$ is a big divisor), where $X$ is a projective variety containing\n$Y$ and $D$ is an effective divisor with support $X-Y$. If $Y$ is algebraic\nStein but not affine, we also discuss the possible transcendental degree of the\nnonconstant regular functions on $Y$. We prove that $Y$ cannot have $d-1$\nalgebraically independent nonconstant regular functions. The interesting\nphenomenon is that the transcendental degree can be even if the dimension of\n$Y$ is even and the degree can be odd if the dimension of $Y$ is odd.\n","Comment: 16 pages, revised version, accepted by Mathematical Research Letters"]}]

First, the total network length should\nnot be much greater than the length of the shortest network connecting all\ncities. Second, the average route length (taken over source-destination pairs)\nshould not be much greater than the average straight-line distance. How small\ncan we make these two differences? For typical configurations the shortest\nnetwork length is order n and the average straight-line distance is order\nn^1/2, so it seems implausible that one can construct a network in which the\nfirst difference is o(n) and the second difference is o(n^1/2). But in fact one\ncan do better: for an arbitrary configuration one can construct a network where\nthe first difference is o(n) and the second difference is almost as small as\nO(log n). The construction is conceptually simple: over the minimum-length\nconnected network (Steiner tree) superimpose a sparse stationary and isotropic\nPoisson line process. The key ingredient is a new result about the Poisson line\nprocess. Consider two points at distance r apart, and delete from the line\nprocess all lines which separate these two points. The resulting pattern of\nlines partitions the plane into cells; the cell containing the two points has\nmean boundary length 2r + C log r.
