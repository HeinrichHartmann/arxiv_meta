By introducing a phase factor extension to the\nphase space, each particle can be treated independently. This is an improvement\non earlier methods that require the whole distribution function to determine\nthe evolution of a constituent particle. The process has branching and\nvanishing points, though a finite time interval can be maintained between the\nbranchings. The procedure to perform a simulation using the process is\npresented.\n","Comment: 12 pages, no figures; replaced with version accepted for publication\n  in J. Phys.
