The main principle of\noperation of the components is the balance between electrical forces and\nmechanical spring forces in micromachined silicon structures.

The drift caused by electrostatic charging effects has turned out to\nbe a major problem. This problem has not yet been solved in DC applications,\nbut it can be circumvented by using AC actuation instead of DC and by\ncompensating the internal DC voltages of the component. In this way, an AC\nvoltage reference with relative drift rate below 2 ppm during a three-week test\nperiod has been constructed.

A comparative study of the scuba algorithm and standard local search\nheuristics has shown the advantage and the limitation of the scuba search. In\norder to tune neutrality, we use the NKq fitness landscapes and a family of\ntravelling salesman problems (TSP) where cities are randomly placed on a\nlattice and where travel distance between cities is computed with the Manhattan\nmetric.

If the filed is binary, in other words, if the\ngraph is ordinary, the operation is just the local complementation. That is, to\nchoose a vertex and complement the subgraph induced by its neighbors. But, in\nthe general case, there are two different types of operators. The first type is\nthe following. Let $v$ be a vertex of the graph and $a\\in \\mathbf{F}_q$, the\nfinite field of $q$ elements. The operator is to obtain a graph with labels\n$g'_{ij}=g_{ij}+ag_{vi}g_{vj}$. For the second type of operators, let $0\\neq\nb\\in \\mathbf{F}_q$ and the resulted graph is a graph with labels\n$g''_{vi}=bg_{vi}$ and $g''_{ij}=g_{ij}$, for $i,j$ unequal to $v$.\n  The local complementation operator (binary case) has appeared in\ncombinatorial theory, and its properties have studied in the literature.\nRecently, a profound relation between local operators on graphs and quantum\nstabilizer codes has been found, and it has become a natural question to\nrecognize equivalency classes under these operators. In the present article, we\nshow that the number of graphs locally equivalent to a given graph is at most\n$q^{2n+1}$, and consequently, the number of classes of local equivalency is\n$q^{\\frac{n^2}{2}-o(n)}$.\n","Comment: 22 pages, no figure, more clear presentation and minor errors fixed"]}]
