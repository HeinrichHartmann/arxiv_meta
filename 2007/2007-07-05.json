If the filed is binary, in other words, if the\ngraph is ordinary, the operation is just the local complementation. That is, to\nchoose a vertex and complement the subgraph induced by its neighbors. But, in\nthe general case, there are two different types of operators. The first type is\nthe following. Let $v$ be a vertex of the graph and $a\\in \\mathbf{F}_q$, the\nfinite field of $q$ elements. The operator is to obtain a graph with labels\n$g'_{ij}=g_{ij}+ag_{vi}g_{vj}$. For the second type of operators, let $0\\neq\nb\\in \\mathbf{F}_q$ and the resulted graph is a graph with labels\n$g''_{vi}=bg_{vi}$ and $g''_{ij}=g_{ij}$, for $i,j$ unequal to $v$.\n  The local complementation operator (binary case) has appeared in\ncombinatorial theory, and its properties have studied in the literature.\nRecently, a profound relation between local operators on graphs and quantum\nstabilizer codes has been found, and it has become a natural question to\nrecognize equivalency classes under these operators. In the present article, we\nshow that the number of graphs locally equivalent to a given graph is at most\n$q^{2n+1}$, and consequently, the number of classes of local equivalency is\n$q^{\\frac{n^2}{2}-o(n)}$.\n","Comment: 22 pages, no figure, more clear presentation and minor errors fixed"]}]
