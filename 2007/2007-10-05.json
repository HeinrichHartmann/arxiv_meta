The sizes do increase significantly with galactocentric\nradius, in a manner more similar to the Milky Way GC system than to those in\nVirgo.

Presupposing a\nconventional unitary theory of low-energy quantum gravity, it offers all this\nby taking the physical density operator of a closed system to be the partial\ntrace of its total density operator (assumed pure) over gravity and by defining\nits physical entropy to be its `matter-gravity entanglement entropy'.

We\nhave shown that QS$GW$ rather well describes energy bands for a wide-range of\nmaterials, including many where the local-density approximation fails. QS$GW$\ncontains physical effects found in other theories such as LDA$+U$, SIC and $GW$\nin a satisfactory manner without many of their drawbacks (partitioning of\nitinerant and localized electrons, adjustable parameters, ambiguities in\ndouble-counting, etc.). We present some theoretical discussion concerning the\nformulation of QS$GW$, including a prescriptino for calculating the total\nenergy. We also address several key methodological points needed for\nimplementation. We then show convergence checks and some representative results\nin a variety of materials.\n","Comment: v2:the same as previous version --but better tex file; v3:add\n  appendix and modify introduction,mainly; v4 mainly, theoretical section (IB\n  IC) are renewed"]}]
