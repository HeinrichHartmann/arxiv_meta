In general, they do the\nsame work for LBM as flux limiters do for finite differences, finite volumes\nand finite elements methods, but for LBM the main idea behind the construction\nof nonequilibrium entropy limiter schemes is to transform a field of a scalar\nquantity - nonequilibrium entropy. There are two families of limiters: (i)\nbased on restriction of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy \"trimming\") and (ii)\nbased on filtering of nonequilibrium entropy (entropy filtering). The physical\nproperties of LBM provide some additional benefits: the control of entropy\nproduction and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are\npossible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:\n1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven\ncavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.\nAll limiter constructions are applicable for both entropic and non-entropic\nquasiequilibria.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 9 figures, 1 table"]}]
