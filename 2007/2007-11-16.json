Given a series of\nstellar spectra obtained over various phases of the planetary orbit, the goal\nis to measure the strength of the component scattered by the planet relative to\nthe component coming directly from the star. We use two complementary\nstrategies, both of which rely on the predictable Doppler shifts of both\ncomponents and on combining the results from many spectral lines and many\nexposures.

In the second strategy, we compare the distribution\nof equivalent-width ratios of the scattered and direct components. Both\nstrategies are calibrated with a ``null test'' in which scrambled Doppler\nshifts are applied to the spectral segments. As an illustrative test case, we\napply our technique to spectra of HD 209458 taken when the planet was near\nopposition (with orbital phases ranging from 11 to 34$\\arcdeg$, where\n0$\\arcdeg$ is at opposition), finding that the planet-to-star flux ratio is\n$(1.4 \\pm 2.9)\\times10^{-4}$ in the wavelength range 554$-$681 nm.

Invoking steady flow in MHD equations, we linearise them\nunder small-amplitude approximation and obtain a new general dispersion\nrelation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves in prominences Results.\nThe presence of steady flow breaks the symmetry of forward and backward\npropagating MHD wave modes in prominences.

We obtain a bound on the error between the distribution of the number of\noccurrences of a word in a sequence (under a Markov model) and its Poisson\napproximation. A global bound is already given by a Chen-Stein method. Our\napproach, the psi-mixing method, gives local bounds. Since we only need the\nerror in the tails of distribution, the global uniform bound of Chen-Stein is\ntoo large and it is a better way to consider local bounds. We search for two\nthresholds on the number of occurrences from which we can regard the studied\nword as an over-represented or an under-represented one. A biological role is\nsuggested for these over- or under-represented words. Our method gives such\nthresholds for a panel of words much broader than the Chen-Stein method.\nComparing the methods, we observe a better accuracy for the psi-mixing method\nfor the bound of the tails of distribution.

Based on these requirements,\nwe propose an annotation model, inspired from the Speech Act Theory (SAT) to\nsupport communication in a 3D digital environment. We define two types of\nannotations in the engineering design context, locutionary and illocutionary\nannotations. The annotations we describe in this paper are materialised by a\nset of digital artefacts, which have a semantic dimension allowing\nexpress/record elements of technical justifications, traces of contradictory\ndebates, etc. In this paper, we first clarify the semantic annotation concept,\nand we define general properties of annotations in the engineering design\ncontext, and the role of annotations in different design project situations.\nAfter the description of the case study, where we observe and analyse\nannotations usage during the design reviews and minute making, the last section\nis dedicated to present our approach. We then describe the SAT concept, and\ndefine the concept of annotation acts. We conclude with a description of basic\nannotation functionalities that are actually implemented in a software, based\non our approach.\n"]}]
