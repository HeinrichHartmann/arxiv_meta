Linear tabling is a framework from which different\nmethods can be derived based on the strategies used in handling looping\nsubgoals. One decision concerns when answers are consumed and returned. This\npaper describes two strategies, namely, {\\it lazy} and {\\it eager} strategies,\nand compares them both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate\nthat, while the lazy strategy has good locality and is well suited for finding\nall solutions, the eager strategy is comparable in speed with the lazy strategy\nand is well suited for programs with cuts. Linear tabling relies on depth-first\niterative deepening rather than suspension to compute fixpoints. Each cluster\nof inter-dependent subgoals as represented by a top-most looping subgoal is\niteratively evaluated until no subgoal in it can produce any new answers. Naive\nre-evaluation of all looping subgoals, albeit simple, may be computationally\nunacceptable.
