Nearly all efficient analyses of large astronomical datasets use\ntrees as their fundamental data structure. Writing efficient tree-based\ntechniques, a task that is time-consuming even on single-processor computers,\nis exceedingly cumbersome on massively parallel platforms (MPPs). Most\napplications that run on MPPs are simulation codes, since the expense of\ndeveloping them is offset by the fact that they will be used for many years by\nmany researchers. In contrast, data analysis codes change far more rapidly, are\noften unique to individual researchers, and therefore accommodate little reuse.\nConsequently, the economics of the current high-performance computing\ndevelopment paradigm for MPPs does not favor data analysis applications. We\nhave therefore built a library, called Ntropy, that provides a flexible,\nextensible, and easy-to-use way of developing tree-based data analysis\nalgorithms for both serial and parallel platforms. Our experience has shown\nthat not only does our library save development time, it can also deliver\nexcellent serial performance and parallel scalability. Furthermore, Ntropy\nmakes it easy for an astronomer with little or no parallel programming\nexperience to quickly scale their application to a distributed multiprocessor\nenvironment. By minimizing development time for efficient and scalable data\nanalysis, we enable wide-scale knowledge discovery on massive datasets.\n","Comment: Accepted to Challenges of Large Applications in Distributed\n  Environments (CLADE) 2007, Monterey, CA. 9 pages and 3 figures"]}]
