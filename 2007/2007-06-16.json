A big loop has been defined to be\nconsisting of a feed forward path from the sensory neurons to the highest\nprocessing area of the brain and feed back paths from that region back up to\nclose to the same sensory neurons. It has been mathematically shown how some\nsmaller cycles can amplify signal. A big loop processes information by contrast\nand amplify principle. It has been assumed that the spike train coming out of a\nfiring neuron encodes all the information produced by it as output. This\ninformation over a period of time can be extracted by a Fourier transform. The\nFourier coefficients arranged in a vector form will uniquely represent the\nneural spike train over a period of time. The information emanating out of all\nthe neurons in a given neural circuit over a period of time will be represented\nby a collection of points in a multidimensional vector space. This cluster of\npoints represents the functional or behavioral form of the neural circuit. It\nhas been proposed that a particular cluster of vectors as the representation of\na new behavior is chosen by the brain interactively with respect to the memory\nstored in that circuit and the synaptic plasticity of the circuit. It has been\nproposed that in this situation a Coulomb force like expression governs the\ndynamics of functioning of the circuit and stability of the system is reached\nat the minimum of all the minima of a potential function derived from the force\nlike expression. The calculations have been done with respect to a pseudometric\ndefined in a multidimensional vector space.\n","Comment: Sixteen pages, two figures.
