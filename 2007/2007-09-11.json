The two kinds of presentation share many traits but also display\nprofound differences on issues ranging from decidability to modeling\nconvenience and physical implementability.\n  Following a conjecture by Toffoli and Margolus, it had been proved by Kari\n(and by Durand--Lose for more than two dimensions) that any invertible CA can\nbe rewritten as an LG (with a possibly much more complex ``unit cell''). But\nuntil now it was not known whether this is possible in general for\nnoninvertible CA--which comprise ``almost all'' CA and represent the bulk of\nexamples in theory and applications.

The models assume organisms\nwhose genomes consist of two chromosomes, where each chromosome is assumed to\nbe functional if it is equal to some master sequence $ \\sigma_0 $, and\nnon-functional otherwise. The first-order growth rate constant, or fitness, of\nan organism, is determined by whether it has zero, one, or two functional\nchromosomes in its genome. For a population replicating asexually, a given cell\nreplicates both of its chromosomes, and splits its genetic material evenly\nbetween the two cells. For a population replicating sexually, a given cell\nfirst divides into two haploids, which enter a haploid pool, fuse into\ndiploids, and then divide via the normal mitotic process. Haploid fusion is\nmodeled as a second-order rate process. When the cost for sex is small, as\nmeasured by the ratio of the characteristic haploid fusion time to the\ncharacteristic growth time, we find that sexual replication with random haploid\nfusion leads to a greater mean fitness for the population than a purely asexual\nstrategy. However, independently of the cost for sex, we find that sexual\nreplication with a selective mating strategy leads to a higher mean fitness\nthan the random mating strategy. This result is based on the assumption that a\nselective mating strategy does not have any additional time or energy costs\nover the random mating strategy, an assumption that is discussed in the paper.\nThe results of this paper are consistent with previous studies suggesting that\nsex is favored at intermediate mutation rates, for slowly replicating\norganisms, and at high population densities.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Physical Review E (additional 4\n  figures included in Phys.

During the early embedded\nphase of protostellar disks, although embryos rapidly emerge in regions\ninterior to the ice line, uninhibited type-I migration leads to their efficient\nself-clearing. But, embryos continue to form from residual planetesimals at\nincreasingly large radii, repeatedly migrate inward, and provide a main channel\nof heavy element accretion onto their host stars. During the advanced stages of\ndisk evolution (a few Myr), the gas surface density declines to values\ncomparable to or smaller than that of the minimum mass nebula model and type-I\nmigration is no longer an effective disruption mechanism for mars-mass embryos.\nOver wide ranges of initial disk surface densities and type-I migration\nefficiency, the surviving population of embryos interior to the ice line has a\ntotal mass several times that of the Earth. With this reservoir, there is an\nadequate inventory of residual embryos to subsequently assemble into rocky\nplanets similar to those around the Sun. But, the onset of efficient gas\naccretion requires the emergence and retention of cores, more massive than a\nfew M_earth, prior to the severe depletion of the disk gas. The formation\nprobability of gas giant planets and hence the predicted mass and semimajor\naxis distributions of extrasolar gas giants are sensitively determined by the\nstrength of type-I migration. We suggest that the observed fraction of\nsolar-type stars with gas giant planets can be reproduced only if the actual\ntype-I migration time scale is an order of magnitude longer than that deduced\nfrom linear theories.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Particularly, the quantum stages of Cycle of Mind involves:1) the\nstimulation of dynamic correlation between water clusters in the same and\nremote microtubules (MTs) in state of mesoscopic Bose condensation (mBC) by\nphonons (acoustic waves) and by librational IR photons (electromagnetic-EM\nwaves) distant exchange; 2) the transition from distant EM interaction between\nremote MTs to nonlocal quantum interaction, induced by IR photons exchange\nbetween clusters, the clusters Virtual Replicas multiplication (VRM) and\nvirtual guides (VirG) formation between elementary particles of remote coherent\nwater molecules. This process represents transition from mesoscopic Bose\ncondensation to macroscopic nonuniform semi-virtual Bose condensation (VirBC)\n(Kaivarainen, 2006, http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0207027); 3) the collapsing of\ncorresponding macroscopic wave function, as a result of the optical bistability\nof the entangled water clusters and their disassembly due to librational\nphotons pumping, shifting clusters to less stable state; 4) turning the\nclusterphilic interaction between water clusters in the open state of cavities\nbetween alpha and beta tubulins to hydrophobic one and the in-phase shift of\nthese cavities to the closed state due to clusters disassembly (Kaivarainen,\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0102086).
