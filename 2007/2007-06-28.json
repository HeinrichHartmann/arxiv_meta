Some\ncommonly reported sites disappear from the robust averages, including\nAlphonsus, Ross D and Gassendi. TLP reports supporting these sites originate\nalmost entirely after year 1955, when TLPs became more popular targets of\nobservation and many more (and inexperienced) observers searched for TLPs. In a\ncompanion paper, we compare the spatial distribution of robust TLP sites of\ntransient outgassing (seen on Apollo and Lunar Prospector). To a high\nconfidence against the random hypothesis, robust TLP sites and those of lunar\noutgassing correlate strongly, further arguing for the reality of TLPs.\n[Abstract abridged.]\n","Comment: 45 pages, 1 figure, submitted to ApJ.

Here we\npropose a path forward, in which current and forthcoming technologies provide a\nmore controlled, sensitive probe of lunar outgassing. Many of these techniques\nare being realized for the first time. Given the optical transient/outgassing\nconnection, progress can be made by remote sensing, and we suggest programs of\nimaging, spectroscopy and combinations thereof. However, as found in Paper II,\nmany aspects of lunar outgassing seem covert in nature. TLPs betray outgassing,\nbut not all outgassing produces TLPs. Some outgassing may never appear at the\nsurface, but remain trapped in the regolith. We also suggest more intrusive\ntechniques, from radar mapping to in-situ probes. Understanding these volatiles\nseems promising in terms of a resource for humans on the Moon and beyond, and\noffers an interesting scientific goal in its own right. Hence this paper is a\nseries of proposed techniques, some in practice, some which might be soon, and\nsome requiring significant future investment, some of which may prove unwise\npending results from predecessor investigations. These point towards\nenhancement of our knowledge of lunar outgassing, its relation to other lunar\nprocesses, and an increase in our understanding of how volatiles are involved\nin the evolution of the Moon. We emphasize certain ground-based observations in\ntime for flights of SELENE, LRO and other robotic missions, and others before\nextensive human xploration.
