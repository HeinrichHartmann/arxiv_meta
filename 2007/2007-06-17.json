The\nmotivation for this (seemingly academic) endeavour is to take the background\nindependence intrinsic to Einstein gravity one step further, and to assure that\nboth the equations of motion and the way in which those equations of motion are\nderived are as self-consistent as possible. That is, solutions to the equations\nof motion of general relativity endow a three-space region with a physical and\ndistinguishing geometry in four-dimensional space-time. However, in order to\nderive these equations of motion one should first be able to choose a\nthree-space region without having any prior knowledge of its physically\nappropriate geometry. The expression of this choice process requires a\nthree-dimensional topological manifold Q, to which all considered three-space\nregions belong, and that generates an equation of motion whose solutions are q.\nThese solutions relate the effects of curvature to the source term through the\ntopology of Q and constitute Einstein gravity. Q is given by 2T^3+3S^1xS^2, and\nis embedded in four dimensions. This points toward a hidden topological content\nfor general relativity, best phrased as: Q and q provide a structure for how to\nchoose a three-space region irrespective of what geometric properties it has,\nwhile at the same time Q and q determine that only GR can endow a three-space\nwith those geometric properties. In this sense, avoiding the Axiom of Choice\nallows one to gain physical insight into GR. Possible links with holography are\npointed out.\n","Comment: final edits: more detail on derivation of equations of motion for q"]}]

In contrast if $G$ is noncompact semisimple,\nthe associated deformation space contains open subsets containing the\nFricke-Teichm\\\"uller space upon which $Mod_\\Sigma$ acts properly. Properness of\nthe $Mod_\\Sigma$-action relates to (possibly singular) locally homogeneous\ngeometric structures on $\\Sigma$.
