We give algorithms for the problem (we call the\nMSCSPv) on which the security of the AAGL protocol is based upon. Hence we give\nvarious attacks for general parameters on the recent AAGL protocol proposed.\nOne of our attacks is a deterministic algorithm which has space complexity and\ntime complexity both atleast exponentialin the worst case. In a better case\nusing a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe\nO(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6),\nwhere the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group,\nXSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit. The above shows the\nAAGL protocol is potentially not significantly more secure as using key\nagreement protocols based on the conjugacy problem such as the AAG\n(Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld) protocol because both protocols can be broken with\ncomplexity which do not significantly differ. We think our attacks can be\nimproved.\n","Comment: This version differs from the first version because a new attack is\n  given"]}]

The representation is based on a quantization condition for the\nrealized action along paths. A lattice regularization is introduced to make\nrigorous sense of the construction and then removed. Quantum mechanics is\nrecovered in the continuum limit and the full U(1) gauge group symmetry of\nelectro-magnetism appears. Anti-particle representations emerge naturally,\nalbeit the context is non-relativistic. Quantum density matrices are obtained\nby averaging classical probability distributions over phase-action variables.\nWe find that quantum conditioning can be described in classical terms but not\nthrough the standard notion of sub sigma-algebras. Delicate restrictions arise\nby the constraint that we are only interested in the algebra of gauge invariant\nrandom variables. We conclude that Quantum Mechanics is equivalent to a theory\nof gauge invariant classical stochastic processes we call Stochastic Mechanics.\n"]}]
