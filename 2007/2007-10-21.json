The efficiency is characterized by means of the average time for the\nexciton to be trapped after the initial excitation. The exciton transport is\ntreated as the intraband energy relaxation over the states obtained by\nnumerically diagonalizing the Frenkel Hamiltonian that corresponds to the\nbiased chain. The relevant intraband scattering rates are obtained from a\nlinear exciton-phonon interaction. Numerical solution of the Pauli master\nequation that describes the relaxation and trapping processes, reveals a\ncomplicated interplay of factors that determine the overall harvesting\nefficiency. Specifically, if the trapping step is slower than or comparable to\nthe intraband relaxation, this efficiency shows a nonmonotonic dependence on\nthe bias: it first increases when introducing a bias, reaches a maximum at an\noptimal bias value, and then decreases again because of dynamic (Bloch)\nlocalization of the exciton states. Effects of on-site (diagonal) disorder,\nleading to Anderson localization, are addressed as well.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Journal of Chemical Physics"]}]
