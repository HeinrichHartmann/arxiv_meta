We fitted with\nempirical functions the gamma-ray and optical light curves and scaled the\nresult to the late time X-rays. The H-band light curve taken by REM shows two\npulses peaking 80 and 140 s after the peak of the gamma-ray burst and possibly\naccompanied by a faint gamma-ray tail. Remarkably, the late optical and X-ray\nafterglow underwent a major rebrightening between 3x10^4 and 2x10^5 s after the\nburst with an X-ray fluence comparable with that of the prompt emission\nextrapolated in the same band. Notably, the time profile of the late\nrebrightening can be described as the combination of a time-rescaled version of\nthe prompt gamma-ray pulse and an underlying power law. This result supports a\ncommon origin for both prompt and late X-ray/optical afterglow rebrightening of\nGRB 070311 within the external shock scenario. The main fireball would be\nresponsible for the prompt emission, while a second shell would produce the\nrebrightening when impacting the leading blastwave in a refreshed shock\n(abridged).\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, accepted to A&A"]}]

It is found that two order parameters with the symmetries $X_3$\nand $\\Delta_5$ induce the structural transformation from the high-temperature\ncubic to the low-temperature monoclinic phase. The coupling between the order\nparameters is described by the Landau free energy functional. The electronic\nand crystal structure for the cubic and monoclinic phases were optimized using\nthe {\\it ab initio} density functional method. The electronic structure\ncalculations were performed within the generalized gradient approximation\nincluding the on-site interactions between 3d electrons at iron ions -- the\nCoulomb element $U$ and Hund's exchange $J$. Only when these local interactions\nare taken into account, the phonon dispersion curves, obtained by the direct\nmethod for the cubic phase, reproduce the experimental data. It is shown that\nthe interplay of local electron interations and the coupling to the lattice\ndrives the phonon order parameters and is responsible for the opening of the\ngap at the Fermi energy. Thus, it is found that the metal-insulator transition\nin magnetite is promoted by local electron interactions, which significantly\namplify the electron-phonon interaction and stabilize weak charge order\ncoexisting with orbital order of the occupied $t_{2g}$ states at Fe ions. This\nprovides a scenario to understand the fundamental problem of the origin of the\nVerwey transition in magnetite.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables.
