The aim of the\nSWEEPS project is to extend our knowledge to stars which (i) are in a different\npart of the Galaxy, (ii) have lower masses, and (iii) have a large range of\nmetallicities. To achieve this goal, we used the Hubble Space Telescope to\nsearch for transiting planets around F, G, K, and M dwarfs in the Galactic\nbulge. We photometrically monitored 180,000 stars in a dense bulge field\ncontinuously for 7 days. We discovered 16 candidate transiting extrasolar\nplanets with periods of 0.6 to 4.2 days, including a new class of ultra-short\nperiod planets (USPPs) with P < 1.2 days. Radial-velocity observations of the\ntwo brightest candidates support their planetary nature. These results suggest\nthat planets are as abundant in the Galactic bulge as they are in the solar\nneighborhood, and they are equally abundant around low-mass stars (within a\nfactor 2). The planet frequency increases with metallicity even for the stars\nin the Galactic bulge. All the USPP hosts are low-mass stars, suggesting either\nthat close-in planets around higher-mass stars are irradiatively evaporated, or\nthat the planets can migrate to close-in orbits only around such old and\nlow-mass stars.\n","Comment: To appear in \"Extreme Solar Systems,\" eds.

By identifying tracks from chargino decays we show that the Wino-like\nnature of the LSP can be determined for a wide range of chargino lifetimes.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 18 figures, added references"]}]

If the local front speed varies randomly due\nto inhomogeneity or motion of the medium (as in turbulent premixed combustion),\nthen the front wrinkles and its overall passage rate (turbulent burning\nvelocity) increases. The calculation of this speedup is subtle because it\ninvolves the minimum-time propagation trajectory. Here we show mathematically\nthat for a medium with weak isotropic random fluctuations, under mild\nconditions on its spatial structure, the speedup scales with the 4/3 power of\nthe fluctuation amplitude. This result, which verifies a previous conjecture\nwhile clarifying its scope, is obtained by reducing the propagation problem to\nthe inviscid Burgers equation with white-in-time forcing. Consequently,\nfield-theoretic analyses of the Burgers equation have significant implications\nfor fronts in random media, even beyond the weak-fluctuation limit.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, elsart5p. v2: additional discussion of\n  Hamiltonian formalism; v3: clarification of transient behavior"]}]

The important classes of quantum cloning machines are\nreviewed, in particular state-independent and state-dependent cloning machines.\nThe 1-to-2 cloning problem is then studied from a formal point of view, using\nthe isomorphism between completely positive maps and operators, which leads to\nthe so-called double-Bell ansatz. This also yields an efficient numerical\napproach to quantum cloning, based on semidefinite programming methods. The\nderivation of the optimal N-to-M universal cloning machine in d dimensions is\nthen detailed, as well as the notion of asymmetric cloning machines. In the\nsecond part of this review, the optical implementation of cloning machines is\nconsidered. It is shown that the universal cloning of photons can be achieved\nby parametric amplification of light or by symmetrization via the\nHong-Ou-Mandel effect. The various experimental demonstrations of quantum\ncloning machines are reviewed. The cloning of orthogonally polarized photons is\nalso considered, as well as the asymmetric and phase-covariant cloning of\nphotons. Finally, the extension of quantum cloning to continuous variables is\nanalyzed. The optimal cloning of coherent states of light by phase-insensitive\namplification is explained, as well as the experimental realization of\ncontinuous-variable quantum cloning with linear optics, measurement, and\nfeed-forward operations.\n","Comment: 76 pages, 14 figures, invited contribution to Progress in Optics, Ed.\n  E.
