We aim to present a robust numerical tool that enables\nmodeling the time-evolution or quasi-stationary of stratified low Mach number\nflows under astrophysical conditions.

Moreover, classical dimensional splitting techniques,\nsuch as ADI or Line-Gauss-Seidel methods are found to be unsuited for modeling\ncompressible flows with low Mach numbers.

We assume that the preconditioner is SPD on each\nstep, and that the condition number of the preconditioned system matrix is\nbounded above by a constant independent of the step number. We show that the CG\nmethod with variable preconditioning under this assumption may not give\nimprovement, compared to the steepest descent (SD) method. We describe the\nbasic theory of CG methods with variable preconditioning with the emphasis on\n``worst case' scenarios, and provide complete proofs of all facts not available\nin the literature. We give a new elegant geometric proof of the SD convergence\nrate bound. Our numerical experiments, comparing the preconditioned SD and CG\nmethods, not only support and illustrate our theoretical findings, but also\nreveal two surprising and potentially practically important effects. First, we\nanalyze variable preconditioning in the form of inner-outer iterations. In\nprevious such tests, the unpreconditioned CG inner iterations are applied to an\nartificial system with some fixed preconditioner as a matrix of coefficients.\nWe test a different scenario, where the unpreconditioned CG inner iterations\nsolve linear systems with the original system matrix $A$. We demonstrate that\nthe CG-SD inner-outer iterations perform as well as the CG-CG inner-outer\niterations in these tests. Second, we show that variable preconditioning may\nsurprisingly accelerate the SD and thus the CG convergence. Specifically, we\ncompare the CG methods using a two-grid preconditioning with fixed and randomly\nchosen coarse grids, and observe that the fixed preconditioner method is twice\nas slow as the method with random preconditioning.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures.
