This was acceptable in classical work because the results were\nnegative: Shannon pointed out that even perfect feedback often does not improve\ncapacity and in the context of symmetric DMCs, Dobrushin showed that it does\nnot improve the fixed block-coding error exponents in the interesting high rate\nregime. However, it has recently been shown that perfect feedback does allow\ngreat improvements in the asymptotic tradeoff between end-to-end delay and\nprobability of error, even for symmetric channels at high rate. Since gains are\nclaimed with ideal instantaneous feedback, it is natural to wonder whether\nthese improvements remain if the feedback is unreliable or otherwise limited.\n  Here, packet-erasure channels are considered on both the forward and feedback\nlinks. First, the feedback channel is considered as a given and a strategy is\ngiven to balance forward and feedback error correction in the suitable\ninformation-theoretic limit of long end-to-end delays. At high enough rates,\nperfect-feedback performance is asymptotically attainable despite having only\nunreliable feedback! Second, the results are interpreted in the zero- sum case\nof \"half-duplex\" nodes where the allocation of bandwidth or time to the\nfeedback channel comes at the direct expense of the forward channel. It turns\nout that even here, feedback is worthwhile since dramatically lower asymptotic\ndelays are possible by appropriately balancing forward and feedback error\ncorrection.\n  The results easily generalize to channels with strictly positive\nzero-undeclared-error capacities.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 6 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory, an earlier version was presented at ITA '07 in UCSD"]}]

The notion of\nend-to-end delay is made precise by considering a sequential setting in which\nsource symbols are revealed in real time and need to be reconstructed at the\ndecoder within a certain fixed latency requirement. Upper bounds are derived on\nthe reliability functions with delay when side-information is known only to the\ndecoder as well as when it is also known at the encoder.\n  When the encoder is not ignorant of the side-information (including the\ntrivial case when there is no side-information), it is possible to have\nsubstantially better tradeoffs between delay and probability of error at all\nrates. This shows that there is a fundamental price of ignorance in terms of\nend-to-end delay when the encoder is not aware of the side information. This\neffect is not visible if only fixed-block-length codes are considered. In this\nway, side-information in source-coding plays a role analogous to that of\nfeedback in channel coding.\n  While the theorems in this paper are asymptotic in terms of long delays and\nlow probabilities of error, an example is used to show that the qualitative\neffects described here are significant even at short and moderate delays.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 17 figures.

Chiral STFs are a class of\nnanoengineered materials whose microstructure comprises parallel helicoidal\nnanowires grown normal to a substrate. The nanowires are $\\sim$10-300 nm in\ndiameter and $\\sim1-10 \\mu$m in length. Durations of transmitted pulses tend to\nincrease with decreasing (free-space) wavelength of the carrier plane wave,\nwhile average speeds tend to increase with increasing wavelength. An increase\nin nonlinearity, as manifested by an intensity-dependent refractive index in\nthe frequency domain, tends to increase durations of transmitted pulses and\ndecrease average speeds. The circular Bragg phenomenon exhibited by a chiral\nSTFs manifests itself in the frequency domain as high reflectivity for normally\nincident carrier plane waves whose circular polarization state is matched to\nthe structural handedness of the film and whose wavelength falls in a range\nknown as the Bragg regime; films of the opposite structural handedness reflect\nsuch plane waves little. This effect tends to distort the shapes of transmitted\npulses with respect to the incident pulses, and such shaping can cause sharp\nchanges in some measures of average speed with respect to carrier wavelength. A\nlocal maximum in the variation of one measure of the pulse duration with\nrespect to wavelength is noted and attributed to the circular Bragg phenomenon.\nSeveral of these effects are explained via frequency-domain arguments. The\npresented results serve as a foundation for future theoretical and experimental\nstudies of optical pulse propagation through causal, nonlinear, nonhomogeneous,\nand anisotropic materials.\n","Comment: To appear in Journal of Modern Optics"]}]
