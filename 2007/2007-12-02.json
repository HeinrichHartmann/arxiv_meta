The basic challenge addressed\nin our work is to calculate the decoherence of electrons interacting with a\nquantum-mechanical environment, while taking proper account of the Pauli\nprinciple. First, we review the usual influence functional approach valid for\ndecoherence of electrons due to classical noise, showing along the way how the\nquantitative accuracy can be improved by properly averaging over closed (rather\nthan unrestricted) random walks. We then use a heuristic approach to show how\nthe Pauli principle may be incorporated into a path-integral description of\ndecoherence in weak localization. This is accomplished by introducing an\neffective modification of the quantum noise spectrum, after which the\ncalculation proceeds in analogy to the case of classical noise. Using this\nsimple but efficient method, which is consistent with much more laborious\ndiagrammatic calculations, we demonstrate how the Pauli principle serves to\nsuppress the decohering effects of quantum fluctuations of the environment, and\nessentially confirm the classic result of Altshuler, Aronov and Khmelnitskii\nfor the energy-averaged decoherence rate, which vanishes at zero temperature.\nGoing beyond that, we employ our method to calculate explicitly the leading\nquantum corrections to the classical decoherence rates, and to provide a\ndetailed analysis of the energy-dependence of the decoherence rate. The basic\nidea of our approach is general enough to be applicable to decoherence of\ndegenerate Fermi systems in contexts other than weak localization as well. --\nPaper II will provide a more rigorous diagrammatic basis for our results, by\nrederiving them from a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the Cooperon.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 8 figures.
