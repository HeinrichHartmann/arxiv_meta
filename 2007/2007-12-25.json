In this paper various convergence results are\nobtained for the corresponding Bergman kernels (i.e. orthogonal projection\nkernels). The convergence is studied in the large k limit and is expressed in\nterms of the equilibrium metric h_e associated to h, as well as in terms of the\nMonge-Ampere measure of h on a certain support set. It is also shown that the\nequilibrium metric h_e is in the class C^{1,1} on the complement of the\naugmented base locus of L. For L ample these results give generalizations of\nwell-known results concerning the case when the curvature of h is globally\npositive (then h_e=h).
