However, most of these studies have focused on driven and\ndissipative systems. The relevance and impact of chaoticlike phenomena to\nquantum systems has been highlighted in recent studies which have shown that\nquantum chaos is significant in some aspects of quantum computation and\ninformation processing. In this paper we study a three-body system comprising\nof identical particles arranged so that the system's classical trajectories\nexhibit Hamiltonian chaos. Here we show that it is possible to recover very\nnearly classical-like, conservative, chaotic trajectories from such a system\nthrough an unravelling of the master equation. First, this is done through\ncontinuous measurement of the position of each system. Second, and perhaps\nsomewhat surprisingly, we demonstrate that we still obtain a very good match\nbetween the classical and quantum dynamics by weakly measuring the position of\nonly one of the oscillators.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The triggering PDC QKD has already been studied in the literature. On\nthe other hand, a model and a post-processing protocol for the entanglement PDC\nQKD are still missing. In this paper, we fill in this important gap by\nproposing such a model and a post-processing protocol for the entanglement PDC\nQKD. Although the PDC model is proposed to study the entanglement-based QKD, we\nemphasize that our generic model may also be useful for other non-QKD\nexperiments involving a PDC source. Since an entangled PDC source is a basis\nindependent source, we apply Koashi-Preskill's security analysis to the\nentanglement PDC QKD. We also investigate the entanglement PDC QKD with two-way\nclassical communications. We find that the recurrence scheme increases the key\nrate and Gottesman-Lo protocol helps tolerate higher channel losses. By\nsimulating a recent 144km open-air PDC experiment, we compare three\nimplementations -- entanglement PDC QKD, triggering PDC QKD and coherent state\nQKD. The simulation result suggests that the entanglement PDC QKD can tolerate\nhigher channel losses than the coherent state QKD. The coherent state QKD with\ndecoy states is able to achieve highest key rate in the low and medium-loss\nregions. By applying Gottesman-Lo two-way post-processing protocol, the\nentanglement PDC QKD can tolerate up to 70dB combined channel losses (35dB for\neach channel) provided that the PDC source is placed in between Alice and Bob.\nAfter considering statistical fluctuations, the PDC setup can tolerate up to\n53dB channel losses.\n","Comment: comments are most welcome"]}]
