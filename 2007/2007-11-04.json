We show that the various phase transitions in this system\ncan be detected by measuring usual thermodynamic quantities like the isothermal\ncompressibility and the uniform magnetic susceptibility. For the isothermal\ncompressibility we show that universal crossing points exist which allow to\naccurately determine the line where the charge gap vanishes. By studying in\naddition several correlation functions, we confirm the existence of a phase\nwith long-range dimer order (bond order) which has been a matter of debate for\nseveral years. According to our calculations this phase is located in a narrow\nregion between the spin-density and charge-density wave phases up to a\ntricritical point which we estimate to be at $U_t=6.7\\pm 0.2$, $V_t =3.5\\pm\n0.1$. Our results for the phase diagram are in good agreement with the most\nrecent zero-temperature density-matrix renormalization group study, however,\nthey disagree in some important aspects from the most recent\nQuantum-Monte-Carlo study.\n","Comment: Reference and figure added"]}]

We show that the symmetry\npredicts three linearly independent constraints on partial wave intensities\nwith even spin for pi(-)p->pi(-)pi(+)n, pi(-)p->pi(0)pi(0)n and\npi(+)p->pi(+)pi(+)n. Available data violate all three constraints for S, D^0,\nD^U and D^N partial waves. The violations of the symmetry imply a presence of\nthe symmetry violating contributions to transversity amplitudes in\npi(-)p->pi(-)pi(+)n and predict quantum entanglement of pi(-)pi(+) isospin\nstates which is excluded by the symmetry. We derive approximate lower and upper\nbounds on entanglement amplitudes |a_S| and |a_A|. The bounds provide a clear\nevidence for entanglement of pi(-)pi(+) isospin states below 840 MeV and\nsuggest the entanglement at higher dipion masses. The small values of |a_S|\n\\sim 0.10-0.20 below 840 MeV explain the puzzling differences between the\nS-wave intensities in pi(-)p->pi(-)pi(+)n and pi(-)p->pi(0)pi(0)n and reveal a\nsuppression of isospin I=0,2 contribution in the S-wave amplitudes in\npi(-)p->pi(-)pi(+)n. The large isospin I=1 contribution of rho^0(770) to both\nS- and P-wave amplitudes is due to large entanglement amplitude |a_A| \\sim\n0.98-0.99. These findings confirm the predictions of a model of non-unitary\ndynamics of the pion creation processes arising from a CPT violating\ninteraction of these processes with a quantum environment.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 13 figures"]}]
