Extracting falsifiable predictions from nonlinear multiparameter models\nis complicated by the fact that such models are commonly sloppy, possessing\nsensitivities to different parameter combinations that range over many decades.\nHere we discuss how sloppiness affects the sorts of data that best constrain\nmodel predictions, makes linear uncertainty approximations dangerous, and\nintroduces computational difficulties in Monte-Carlo uncertainty analysis.

The inequalities\nare valid for any number of outcomes of two observables per each of n parties,\nincluding continuous and unbounded observables. We show that there are no\nfirst-moment correlation Bell inequalities for that scenario, but such\ninequalities can be found if one considers at least second moments. The\nderivation stems from a simple variance inequality by setting local commutators\nto zero. We show that above a constant detector efficiency threshold, the\ncontinuous variable Bell violation can survive even in the macroscopic limit of\nlarge n. This method can be used to derive other well-known Bell inequalities,\nshedding new light on the importance of non-commutativity for violations of\nlocal realism.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure. v2: New results on detector efficiencies and\n  macroscopic limit, new co-author, changed title and abstract, changed figure,\n  added journal reference and DOI"]}]
