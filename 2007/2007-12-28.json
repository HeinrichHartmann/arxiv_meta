It is demonstrated that a huge amount of structural\ndata can be handled within a reasonable CPU time by using a conventional\nrelational database management system with appropriate indexing of geometric\ndata. This method, which we call geometric indexing, can enumerate ligand\nbinding sites that are structurally similar to sub-structures of a query\nprotein among more than 160,000 possible candidates within a few hours of CPU\ntime on an ordinary desktop computer. After detecting a set of high scoring\nligand binding sites by the geometric indexing search, structural alignments at\natomic resolution are constructed by iteratively applying the Hungarian\nalgorithm, and the statistical significance of the final score is estimated\nfrom an empirical model based on a gamma distribution. Applications of this\nmethod to several protein structures clearly shows that significant\nsimilarities can be detected between local structures of non-homologous as well\nas homologous proteins.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables"]}]

Each particle is\nsent to the intended receiver, always delaying the transmission until the\nreceiver has acknowledged the previous particle on an authenticated classical\nchannel, restricting eavesdropping to accessing the quantum transmission one\nparticle at a time. Hence, an eavesdropper cannot undo the non-local\ntransformation perfectly. Even if perfect cloning of quantum states was\npossible the state of the group could not be cloned. We calculate the maximal\ninformation on the established key provided by an intercept-resend attack and\nthe induced disturbance for different transformations.
