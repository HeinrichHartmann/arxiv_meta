This allows sufficient separation of scales to\nobserve a Navier-Stokes (NS) inertial range followed by a 2nd LANS inertial\nrange. The analysis of the third-order structure function scaling supports the\npredicted l^3 scaling; it corresponds to a k^(-1) scaling of the energy\nspectrum. The energy spectrum itself shows a different scaling which goes as\nk^1. This latter spectrum is consistent with the absence of stretching in the\nsub-filter scales due to the Taylor frozen-in hypothesis employed as a closure\nin the derivation of LANS. These two scalings are conjectured to coexist in\ndifferent spatial portions of the flow. The l^3 (E(k) k^(-1)) scaling is\nsubdominant to k^1 in the energy spectrum, but the l^3 scaling is responsible\nfor the direct energy cascade, as no cascade can result from motions with no\ninternal degrees of freedom. We verify the prediction for the size of the LANS\nattractor resulting from this scaling. From this, we give a methodology either\nfor arriving at grid-independent solutions for LANS, or for obtaining a\nformulation of a LES optimal in the context of the alpha models. The fully\nconverged grid-independent LANS may not be the best approximation to a direct\nnumerical simulation of the NS equations since the minimum error is a balance\nbetween truncation errors and the approximation error due to using LANS instead\nof the primitive equations. Furthermore, the small-scale behavior of LANS\ncontributes to a reduction of flux at constant energy, leading to a shallower\nenergy spectrum for large alpha. These small-scale features, do not preclude\nLANS to reproduce correctly the intermittency properties of high Re flow.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 17 figures"]}]

After correction for reddening, the steady state AGN optical--UV\nspectral energy distributions (SEDs) are very similar. The SEDs are dominated\nenergetically by the big blue bump (BBB), but this bump never shows the\nnu^{+1/3} spectrum predicted for a standard thin accretion disk with a\nr^{-0.75} radial temperature gradient. Instead, the observed optical-UV SED\nimplies a temperature gradient of r^{-0.57} independent of the thickness of the\ndisk. This means that there is some flow of heat outwards in the disk. The disk\nis large and the region emitting the optical continuum is as large as the inner\nbroad-line region (BLR). Because optical variability is seen in all AGNs on the\nlight-crossing time of the BLR, variations must propagate at close to the speed\nof light, rather than on dynamical timescales. This argues that the\nenergy-generation mechanism is electromagnetic rather that hydrodynamic. Since\nthe velocities are near the speed of light, there can be significant local\nanisotropy in the emission. The large rapid variations of the BBB imply that\nthe magnetohydrodynamic energy generation is fundamentally unstable. Because of\nthe inevitable radial temperature gradient in the accreting material, different\nspectral regions come predominantly from different radii, and variations in\ndifferent spectral regions correspond to variability at different radii.

An overring $T$ of $R$\nis $t$-linked over $R$ if $I^{-1}=R$ implies that $(T:IT)=T$ for each finitely\ngenerated ideal $I$ of $R$. Let $O_{t}(R)$ denotes the set of all $t$-linked\noverrings of $R$ and $O(R)$ the set of all overrings of $R$. The purpose of\nthis paper is to study some finiteness conditions on the set $O_{t}(R)$.\nParticularly, we prove that if $O_{t}(R)$ is finite, then so is $O(R)$ and\n$O_{t}(R)=O(R)$, and if each chain of $t$-linked overrings of $R$ is finite,\nthen each chain of overrings of $R$ is finite. This yields that the $t$-linked\napproach is more efficient than the Gilmer's treatment in \\cite{G1}. We also\nexamine the finiteness conditions in some Noetherian-like settings such as Mori\ndomain, quasicoherent Mori domain, Krull domain etc. We establish a connection\nbetween $O_{t}(R)$ and the set of all strongly divisorial ideals of $R$ and we\nconclude by a characterization of domains $R$ that are $t$-linked under all\ntheir overrings.\n","Comment: 14 pages"]}]
