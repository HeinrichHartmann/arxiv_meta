During the past decade, there has been an\nincreasing emphasis on miniaturization of chemical analysis systems and\nnaturally this has stimulated a large effort in integrating microfluidics and\noptics in lab-on-a-chip microsystems. This development is partly defining the\nemerging field of optofluidics. Scaling analysis and experiments have\ndemonstrated the advantage of micro-scale devices over their macroscopic\ncounterparts for a number of chemical applications. However, from an optical\npoint of view, miniaturized devices suffer dramatically from the reduced\noptical path compared to macroscale experiments, e.g. in a cuvette.

The enhanced phase mixing of 0.1 Hz harmonic Alfven waves\npropagating in strongly divergent, H_b=5 Mm, stratified coronal structures,\nH_rho=50 Mm, can fulfill 100% of an active region heating requirement, by\ngenerating viscous heating fluxes of F_H~2100 J /m^2 /s. The Alfven waves in\nthis configuration are fully dissipated within 20 Mm, which is six times lower\nthan would occur as a result of standard phase mixing in uniform magnetic\nfields. This results in the heating scale height, s_H, being lowered by a\nfactor of six, to less than half of an active regions density scale height.\nUsing the corrected analytical solutions it was found that, for a given wave\nfrequency, the generation of a heating scale height of s_H<=50 Mm, by enhanced\nphase mixing in strongly divergent magnetic fields, requires a shear viscosity\neight orders of magnitude lower, than required by standard phase mixing in\nuniform magnetic fields. It was also found that the enhanced phase mixing of\nobservable, 0.01 rads /s Alfven waves, in strongly divergent magnetic fields,\nH_b=5 Mm, can generate heating scale heights within a density scale height,\nH_rho=50 Mm, using classical Braginskii viscosity. It is therefore not\nnecessary to invoke anomalous viscosity in corona, if phase mixing takes place\nin strongly divergent magnetic fields.
