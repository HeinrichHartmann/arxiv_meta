It is described how\nself-dual SVOAs can be constructed from self-dual VOAs of larger central\ncharge. The analogy with integral lattices and binary codes is emphasized.\n  One main result is the construction of the shorter Moonshine module, a\nself-dual SVOA of central charge 23.5 on which the Baby monster - the second\nlargest sporadic simple group - acts by automorphisms. The shorter Moonshine\nmodule has the character q^(-47/48)*(1+ 4371q^(3/2)+ 96256q^2+ 1143745q^(5/2)\n+...) and is the \"shorter cousin\" of the Moonshine module.

The study of these systems has attracted great\nattention during the last decades due to, on the one hand, the rich and complex\nunderlying physics, and on the other hand, their relevance for numerous\ntechnological applications in heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion and coating,\ndevelopment of microelectronic devices, etc. The review is focuses on recent\nadvances in the understanding of irreversible phase transitions (IPT's)\nproviding a survey of the theoretical development of the field during the last\ndecade, as well as a detailed discussion of relevant numerical simulations. The\nLangevin formulation for the treatment of second-order IPT's is discussed.\nDifferent Monte Carlo approaches are also presented in detail and the\nfinite-size scaling analysis of second-order IPT's is described. Special\nattention is devoted to the description of recent progress in the study of\nfirst-order IPT's observed upon catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide and the\nreduction of nitrogen monoxide, using lattice gas reaction models. Only brief\ncomments are given on other reactions such as the oxidation of hydrogen,\nammonia synthesis, etc. Also, a discussion of relevant experiments is presented\nand measurement are compared with the numerical results. Furthermore, promising\nareas for further research and open questions are also addressed.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 18 figures"]}]
