The model was stimulated by our discovery\nthat a majority of scientific citations are copied from the lists of references\nused in other papers (cond-mat/0212043). It accounted quantitatively for\nseveral properties of empirically observed distribution of citations. However,\nimportant features, such as power-law distribution of citations to papers\npublished during the same year and the fact that the average rate of citing\ndecreases with aging of a paper, were not accounted for by that model. Here we\npropose a modified model: when a scientist writes a manuscript, he picks up\nseveral random recent papers, cites them and also copies some of their\nreferences. The difference with the original model is the word recent. We solve\nthe model using methods of the theory of branching processes, and find that it\ncan explain the aforementioned features of citation distribution, which our\noriginal model couldn't account for. The model can also explain \"sleeping\nbeauties in science\", i.e., papers that are little cited for a decade or so,\nand later \"awake\" and get a lot of citations. Although much can be understood\nfrom purely random models, we find that to obtain a good quantitative agreement\nwith empirical citation data one must introduce Darwinian fitness parameter for\nthe papers.\n"]}]

But much paleontology data concerns time series or trees on\nhigher-order taxa, and any broad picture of relationships between extant groups\nrequires use of higher-order taxa. A coherent model for trees on (say) genera\nshould involve both a species-level model and a model for the classification\nscheme by which species are assigned to genera. We present a general framework\nfor such models, and describe three alternate classification schemes. Combining\nwith the species-level model of Aldous-Popovic (2005), one gets models for\nhigher-order trees, and we initiate analytic study of such models.
