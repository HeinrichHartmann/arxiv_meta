While classical capacity is not enough, a sense of capacity\n(parametrized by reliability) called \"anytime capacity\" is both necessary and\nsufficient for channel evaluation in this context. The rate required is the log\nof the open-loop system gain and the required reliability comes from the\ndesired sense of stability. Sufficiency is maintained even in cases with noisy\nobservations and without any explicit feedback between the observer and the\ncontroller. This established the asymptotic equivalence between scalar\nstabilization problems and delay-universal communication problems with\nfeedback.\n  Here in part II, the vector-state generalizations are established and it is\nthe magnitudes of the unstable eigenvalues that play an essential role. To deal\nwith such systems, the concept of the anytime rate-region is introduced. This\nis the region of rates that the channel can support while still meeting\npotentially different anytime reliability targets for parallel message streams.\nAll the scalar results generalize on an eigenvalue by eigenvalue basis. When\nthere is no explicit feedback of the noisy channel outputs, the intrinsic delay\nof the unstable system tells us what the feedback delay needs to be while\nevaluating the anytime-rate-region for the channel.

Based on the explicit\nrepresentations obtained for the values of T- and S-matrices on the unphysical\nsheets, we prove that the resonances belonging to an unphysical sheet are just\nthose energies where the correspondingly truncated scattering matrix, taken in\nthe physical sheet, has eigenvalue zero. We show, in addition, that\neigenvectors of the truncated scattering matrix associated with its zero\neigenvalue are formed of the breakup amplitudes for the respective resonant\nstates.\n","Comment: Based on a talk presented at the UNISA-JINR Symposium \"Models and\n  Methods in Few- and Many-Body Systems\" (6-9 February 2007, Skukuza, Kruger\n  National Park, South Africa"]}]
