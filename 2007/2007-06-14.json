The observed velocity vector (amplitude and\ndirection) of the clusters in the galactic plane is derived from the catalog\ndata. In the epicycle approximation, this velocity is the sum of the circular\nvelocity, described by the galactic rotation curve, and of a residual velocity,\nwhich has a direction that rotates with the frequency $\\kappa$. If for some\nreason the clusters are formed with non-random initial perturbation velocity\ndirection (measured for instance with respect to the direction of circular\nrotation), then a plot of the orientation angle of the residual velocity as a\nfunction of age reveals the epicycle frequency. The data analysis confirms that\nthis is the case; due to the non-random initial velocities, it is possible to\nmeasure $\\kappa$ for different galactic radii.

Lett., 78\n(1997), pp. 4733-4736] with a modified semi-implicit Euler iterative scheme and\nseeding with periodic orbits of neighbouring periods, has been shown to be\nhighly efficient when applied to low-dimensional system. The difficulty in\napplying the algorithm to higher dimensional systems is mainly due to the fact\nthat the number of stabilising transformations grows extremely fast with\nincreasing system dimension. In this thesis, we construct stabilising\ntransformations based on the knowledge of the stability matrices of already\ndetected periodic orbits (used as seeds). The advantage of our approach is in a\nsubstantial reduction of the number of transformations, which increases the\nefficiency of the detection algorithm, especially in the case of\nhigh-dimensional systems. The performance of the new approach is illustrated by\nits application to the four-dimensional kicked double rotor map, a\nsix-dimensional system of three coupled H\\'enon maps and to the\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky system in the weakly turbulent regime.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 119 pages.

The model requires\nthe specification of a preferred sequence of space-like hyper-surfaces\nsupporting the time-like state evolution. However, it is shown that the choice\nof preferred surfaces has no effect on perturbative results to second order in\nthe coupling parameter. It is demonstrated how state reduction to a charge\ndensity basis can be induced in fermionic matter via an appropriate coupling to\na bosonic field undergoing this mechanism.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures, replacement with revised section III"]}]
