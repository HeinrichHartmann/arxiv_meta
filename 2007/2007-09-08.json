Taking the Bi(111) surface, on which strong surface states and\nRashba spin-orbit coupling are present [Phys. Rev.

The Fermi-energy-dependence of the spin and charge transport\nin two-terminal nanostructure samples is subsequently analyzed. By changing\nE_{F}, we show that the ISHA pattern is nearly isotropic (free-electron-like)\nonly when E_{F} is close to the band bottom, and is sensitive/insensitive to\nE_{F} for the low/high bias regime with such E_{F}. With E_{F} far from the\nband bottom, band structure effects thus enter the ISHA patterns and the\ntransport direction becomes significant.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]
