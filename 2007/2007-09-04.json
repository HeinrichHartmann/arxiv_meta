The\nthermal poling was done by sputtering thin Pt electrode films onto the faces of\nthe glass samples and by applying voltages up to 1 kV to the electrodes at\ntemperatures up to 513 K. The poling leads to the formation of interfacial\nlayers under the electrodes which are responsible for two depolarization\ncurrent peaks and for one additional semicircle in a Nyquist plot of the ac\nimpedance. The SEM/EDX profiles suggest that redox and transport processes of\nNa+ ions are responsible for the formation of the interfacial layers and that\nCa2+ ions are immobile under the poling conditions. The sodium depletion layer\nunder the anode leads to a negative surface charge of the glass samples which\nmay enhance their bioactivity.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Their existence was discovered in\nthe early 1980's, independently by Herman for quasiperiodic SL(2,R)-cocycles\nand by Grebogi et al for so-called 'pinched skew products'. However, except for\nthese two particular classes there are still hardly any rigorous results on the\ntopic, despite a large number of numerical studies which all confirmed the\nwidespread existence of SNA in quasiperiodically forced systems.\n  Here, we prove the existence of SNA in quasiperiodically forced circle maps\nunder rather general conditions, which can be stated in terms of C 1\n-estimates. As a consequence, we obtain the existence of strange non-chaotic\nattractors for parameter sets of positive measure in suitable parameter\nfamilies. Further, we show that the considered systems have minimal dynamics.\nThe results apply in particular to a forced version of the Arnold circle map.\nFor this particular example, we also describe how the first Arnold tongue\ncollapses and looses its regularity due to the presence of strange non-chaotic\nattractors and a related unbounded mean motion property.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 1 figure"]}]

Sufficient\nconditions for boundedness and compactness of the embedding operators are\nobtained for smooth domains and domains with boundary singularities. The\nproposed method is based on the concept of 'generalized' quasiconformal\nhomeomorphisms (homeomorphisms with bounded mean distortion.) The choice of the\nhomeomorphism type depends on the choice of the corresponding weighted Sobolev\nspace. Such classes of homeomorphisms induce bounded composition operators for\nweighted Sobolev spaces. With the help of these homeomorphism classes the\nembedding problem for non-smooth domains is reduced to the corresponding\nclassical embedding problem for smooth domains. Examples of domains with\nanisotropic H\\\"older singularities demonstrate sharpness of our machinery\ncomparatively with known results.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]

If the average growth rate is negative then the model has a\nsurvival-extinction transition; the location of this transition in the\nparameter space is constrained using variational arguments and delimited by\nsimulations. The statistical steady state reached when the system is in the\nsurvival region of parameter space is characterized by integral constraints and\nupper and lower bounds on the biomass and productivity that follow from\nvariational arguments and direct inequalities. In the limit of\nzero-decorrelation time the velocity field is shown to act as Fickian diffusion\nwith an eddy diffusivity much larger than the molecular diffusivity and this\nallows a one-dimensional model to predict the biomass, productivity and\nextinction transitions.
