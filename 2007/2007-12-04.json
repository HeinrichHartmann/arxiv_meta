Using\nthe ETAS branching model of triggered seismicity, we apply the formalism of\ngenerating probability functions to investigate how the statistical properties\nof observable earthquakes differ from the statistics of all events. The ETAS\n(epidemic-type aftershock sequence) model assumes that each earthquake can\ntrigger other earthquakes (``aftershocks'').

The\ntriggering efficiency of earthquakes is assumed to vanish below a lower\nmagnitude limit $m_0$, in order to ensure the convergence of the theory and may\nreflect the physics of state-and-velocity frictional rupture.

In the latter case the smaller\nsubsystem is usually a single spin or a block of adjacent spins and the\nentanglement differentiates between critical and non-critical regimes. Here we\nextend this approach by considering a more general setting: our smaller\nsubsystem $S_A$ consists of a {\\it comb} of $L$ spins, spaced $p$ sites apart.\nOur results are thus not restricted to a simple `area law', but contain\nnon-local information, parameterized by the spacing $p$.
