A full analytical treatment is presented for\nthe case of a paraboloid of revolution. Using the geometrical theory of\ntopological defects in a continuum elastic background we find that the presence\nof a variable Gaussian curvature, combined with the additional constraint of a\nboundary, gives rise to a rich variety of phenomena beyond that known for\nspherical crystals. We also provide a numerical analysis of a system of\nclassical particles interacting via a Coulomb potential on the surface of a\nparaboloid.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures"]}]
