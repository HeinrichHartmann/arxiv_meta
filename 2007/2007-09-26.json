The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either\nprojection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the\ninterpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing\nall possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an\nincremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good\noption, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It\nhas two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still\nhuge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral\nvariables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the\ncoefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in\nthe forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find\nnonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used\ncorrelation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the\nresults, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The\nexperiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show\nthat the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables,\nmaking interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load.

Both resonant Rayleigh response and the absorption and\nphotoluminescence, are affected by the presence of quantum well disorder, which\nintroduces a distribution of oscillator strengths between quantum well excitons\nat a given energy and cavity photons at a given momentum. As we show, this\ndistribution makes it important that in the condensed regime, scattering by\ndisorder is taken into account to all orders. We show that, in the low density\nlinear limit, this approach correctly describes inhomogeneous broadening of\npolaritons. In addition, in this limit, we extract a linear blue-shift of the\nlower polariton versus density, with a coefficient determined by temperature\nand by a characteristic disorder length.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures; minor corrections"]}]

Assuming the magnetic\nmoments of all atoms are initially aligned along the magnetic field we observe,\nafter the field's direction is reversed, a transfer of atoms to other Zeeman\nstates. Such transfer is allowed by the dipolar interaction which couples the\nspin and the orbital degrees of freedom. Therefore, the atoms in $m_F=0,-1$\nstates acquire an orbital angular momentum and start to circulate around the\ncenter of the trap. This is a realization of the Einstein-de Haas effect in\nsystems of cold gases. We find resonances which amplify this phenomenon making\nit observable even in very weak dipolar systems. The resonances occur when the\nZeeman energy on transfer of atoms to $m_F=0$ state is fully converted to the\nrotational kinetic energy.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In this article we study the case of a\nhigh-pinning/low-pinning/high-pinning layered structure. We have developed an\nelastic model for describing the deformation of a vortex in these systems in\nthe presence of a uniform transport current density $J$ for any arbitrary\norientation of the transport current and the magnetic field. If $J$ is above a\ncertain critical value, $J_c$, the vortex breaks and a finite effective\nresistance appears. Our model can be applied to some experimental\nconfigurations where vortex breaking naturally exists. This is the case for\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-x}$ (YBCO) low angle grain boundaries and films on vicinal\nsubstrates, where the breaking is experienced by Abrikosov-Josephson vortices\n(AJV) and Josephson string vortices (SV), respectively.
