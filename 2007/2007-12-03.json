This enables to derive the renormalized\nquantities in a manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the\nform of strongly convergent integrals. However, applications of the Abel-Plana\nformula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the\neigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized\nthe Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based\non this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series\nover the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving\nthese functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special\ncases existing in literature. Further, the derived summation formulae have been\nused to summarize series arising in the direct mode summation approach to the\nCasimir effect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries, for\nboundaries moving with uniform proper acceleration, and in various braneworld\nscenarios. This allows to extract from the vacuum expectation values of local\nphysical observables the parts corresponding to the geometry without boundaries\nand to present the boundary-induced parts in terms of integrals strongly\nconvergent for the points away from the boundaries. As a result, the\nrenormalization procedure for these observables is reduced to the corresponding\nprocedure for bulks without boundaries. The present paper reviews these\nresults.

Glassey} and J. Schaeffer, the main\nenergy estimates which are used in global existence results for the\ngravitational Vlasov-Poisson system do not apply to the relativistic version of\nthis system, and smooth solutions to the initial value problem with spherically\nsymmetric initial data of negative energy blow up in finite time. For similar\nreasons the variational techniques by which Y. Guo and G. Rein obtained\nnonlinear stability results for the Vlasov-Poisson system do not apply in the\nrelativistic situation. In the present paper a direct, non-variational approach\nis used to prove nonlinear stability of certain steady states of the\nrelativistic Vlasov-Poisson system against spherically symmetric, dynamically\naccessible perturbations. The resulting stability estimates imply that smooth\nsolutions with spherically symmetric initial data which are sufficiently close\nto the stable steady states exist globally in time.\n","Comment: 38 pages"]}]

To resolve these differences we have studied\nexperimentally the unidirectional pedestrian flow through bottlenecks under\nlaboratory conditions. The time development of quantities like individual\nvelocities, density and individual time gaps in bottlenecks of different width\nis presented. The data show a linear growth of the flow with the width. The\ncomparison of the results with experimental data of other authors indicates\nthat the basic assumption of the capacity estimation for bottlenecks has to be\nrevised.
