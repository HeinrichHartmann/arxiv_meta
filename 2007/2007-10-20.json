At $T_{c2}$=20 K, K$_{0.5}$CoO$_2$ becomes an insulator with a tiny\noptical gap as happens in Na$_{0.5}$CoO$_2$ at 52 K. This similarity, with a\nknown common structure, enables direct comparisons to be made. Using the\nK-zigzag structure recently reported and the local density approximation, we\ncompare and contrast these cobaltates at x=0.5. Although the electronic\nstructures are quite similar as expected, substantial differences are observed\nnear the Fermi level. These differences are found to be attributable mostly to\nthe chemical, rather than structural difference: although Na is normally\nconsidered to be fully ion, K has somewhat more highly ionic character than\ndoes Na in these cobaltates.\n","Comment: 5 papers"]}]

To\nthis end we illustrate how the single orbital contributions show up in the\ntotal high-harmonic signal. This example illustrates the importance of adding\ncoherently amplitude contributions from the individual degenerate orbitals.\nFinally, we study the high-harmonic generation from propane (C$_3$H$_8$) and\nbutane (C$_4$H$_{10}$). These two molecules, being extended and far from\nspherical in structure, produce harmonics with non-trivial orientational\ndependencies.
