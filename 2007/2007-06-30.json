The performance of phylogenetic reconstruction methods where\nthe underlying data is generated by a mixture model has stimulated considerable\nrecent debate. Much of the controversy stems from simulations of mixture model\ndata on a given tree topology for which reconstruction algorithms output a tree\nof a different topology; these findings were held up to show the shortcomings\nof particular tree reconstruction methods. In so doing, the underlying\nassumption was that mixture model data on one topology can be distinguished\nfrom data evolved on an unmixed tree of another topology given enough data and\nthe ``correct'' method. Here we show that this assumption can be false. For\nbiologists our results imply that, for example, the combined data from two\ngenes whose phylogenetic trees differ only in terms of branch lengths can\nperfectly fit a tree of a different topology.\n"]}]

It is imperative to study and characterize the fundamental\nstructure of wireless user behavior in order to model, manage, leverage and\ndesign efficient mobile networks. It is also important to make such study as\nrealistic as possible, based on extensive measurements collected from existing\ndeployed wireless networks.\n  In this study, using our systematic TRACE approach, we analyze wireless\nusers' behavioral patterns by extensively mining wireless network logs from two\nmajor university campuses. We represent the data using location preference\nvectors, and utilize unsupervised learning (clustering) to classify trends in\nuser behavior using novel similarity metrics. Matrix decomposition techniques\nare used to identify (and differentiate between) major patterns. While our\nfindings validate intuitive repetitive behavioral trends and user grouping, it\nis surprising to find the qualitative commonalities of user behaviors from the\ntwo universities. We discover multi-modal user behavior for more than 60% of\nthe users, and there are hundreds of distinct groups with unique behavioral\npatterns in both campuses. The sizes of the major groups follow a power-law\ndistribution.
