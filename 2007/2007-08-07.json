We discuss the nature of the MSX sources (mostly AGB\nstars), their luminosities, the interstellar extinction, the mass-loss rate\ndistribution and the total mass-loss rate in the bulge. The MIR data of MSX\npoint sources have been combined with the NIR (J, H and Ks) data of 2MASS\nsurvey. The cross-identification was restricted to Ks-band detected sources\nwith Ks <= 11 mag. However, for those bright MSX D-band sources ([D] < 4.0\nmag), which do not satisfy this criteria, we have set no Ks-band magnitude cut\noff. The relation between Mdot and (Ks-[15])0 was used to derive the mass-loss\nrate of each MSX source in the bulge fields. Except for very few post-AGB\nstars, PNe and OH/IR stars, a large fraction of the detected sources at 15\nmicron (MSX D-band) are AGB stars well above the RGB tip. A number of them show\nan excess in ([A]-[D])0 and (Ks-[D])0 colours, characteristic of mass-loss.\nThese colours, especially (Ks-[D])0, enable estimation of the mass-loss rates\n(Mdot) of the sources in the bulge fields which range from 10^{-7} to 10^{-4}\nMsun/yr. Taking into consideration the completeness of the mass-loss rate bins,\nwe find that the contribution to the integrated mass-loss is probably dominated\nby mass-loss rates larger than 3x10^{-7} Msun/yr and is about 1.96 x 10^{-4}\nMsun/yr/deg^2 in the \"intermediate\" and \"outer\" bulge fields of sources with\nmass-loss rates, Mdot > 3x10^{-7} Msun/yr. The corresponding integrated\nmass-loss rate per unit stellar mass is 0.48x10^{-11} yr^{-1}.

This\ncritique briefly reviews the experimental evidence regarding the failure of the\npostulates, and the implications for our understanding of fundamental physics,\nand in particular for our understanding of gravity. A new theory of gravity is\nseen to be necessary, and this results in an explanation of the `dark matter'\neffect entailing the discovery that the fine structure constant is a 2nd\ngravitational constant.\n","Comment: PDF 12 pages, 7 figures"]}]

A simple mechanism, where system particles are randomly reset\nto some standard initial state, can counteract the deteriorating effect of\ndecoherence, resulting in an entangled steady state far from thermodynamical\nequilibrium. We present models for both gas-type systems and for strongly\ncoupled systems. We point out in which way the entanglement resulting from such\na reset mechanism is different from the entanglement that one can find in\nthermal states. We develop master equations to describe the system and its\ninteraction with an environment, study toy models with two particles (qubits),\nwhere the master equation can often be solved analytically, and finally examine\nlarger systems with possibly fluctuating particle numbers. We find that in\ngas-type systems, the reset mechanism can produce an entangled steady state for\nan arbitrary temperature of the environment, while this is not true in strongly\ncoupled systems.
