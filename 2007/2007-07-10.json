The basic idea is to integrate models for nonmotorized vehicles\n(nm-vehicles) with models for motorized vehicles (m-vehicles). Based on the\nidea, a model for mix traffic flow is realized in in the following two steps.\nAt a first step, the models that can be integrated should be chosen. The famous\nNaSch cellular automata (NCA) model for m-vehicles and the Burgur cellular\nautomata (BCA) model for nm-vehicles are used in this paper, since the two\nmodels are similar and comparable. At a second step, we should study coupling\nrules between m-vehicles and nm-vehicles to represent their interaction.\nSpecial lane changing rules are designed for the coupling process. The proposed\nmodel is named as the combined cellular automata (CCA) model. The model is\napplied to a typical mixed traffic scenario, where a bus stop without special\nstop bay is set on nonmotorized lanes. The simulation results show that the\nmodel can describe both the interaction between the flow of nm-vehicles and\nm-vehicles and their characters.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to Phys.

This positive feedback is attenuated during growth on lactose\nbecause hydrolysis of lactose by galactosidase suppresses the stimulatory\neffect of the permease. But the stabilizing effect of dilution also changes\ndramatically as a function of the medium composition. For instance, during\ngrowth on TMG/succinate, the dilution rate of the permease is proportional to\nits activity, $e$, because the specific growth rate is independent of $e$.\nHowever, during growth on lactose, the permease dilution rate is proportional\nto $e^2$ because the specific growth rate is proportional to the specific\nlactose uptake rate, which in turn, proportional to $e$. Here, we show that:\n(a) This dependence on $e^2$ creates such a strong stabilizing effect that\nbistability is virtually impossible during growth on lactose, even in the face\nof positive feedback. (b) This stabilizing effect is weakened during growth on\nlactose + glucose because the specific growth rate on glucose is independent of\n$e$, so that the dilution rate once again contains a term that is proportional\nto $e$. We discuss the experimental data in the light of these results.\n","Comment: 34 pages, Bull Math Biol"]}]

Mathematics employed\nto study the periodic system includes number theory, information theory, order\ntheory, set theory and topology. Each theory used shows that it is possible to\nprovide the Periodic Law with a mathematical structure. We also show that it is\npossible to study the chemical elements taking advantage of their\nphenomenological properties, and that it is not always necessary to reduce the\nconcept of chemical elements to the quantum atomic concept to be able to find\ninterpretations for the Periodic Law. Finally, a connection is noted between\nthe lengths of the periods of the Periodic Law and the philosophical\nPythagorean doctrine.\n","Comment: 20 pages, PDF file"]}]

Conversely, it is shown that if their holomorphs are isomorphic,\nthen the loops are isotopic. It is shown that a loop is a Smarandache loop if\nand only if its holomorph is a Smarandache loop. This statement is also shown\nto be true for some weak Smarandache loops(inverse property, weak inverse\nproperty) but false for others(conjugacy closed, Bol, central, extra, Burn, A-,\nhomogeneous) except if their holomorphs are nuclear or central. A necessary and\nsufficient condition for the Nuclear-holomorph of a Smarandache Bol loop to be\na Smarandache Bruck loop is shown. Whence, it is found also to be a Smarandache\nKikkawa loop if in addition the loop is a Smarandache A-loop with a centrum\nholomorph. Under this same necessary and sufficient condition, the\nCentral-holomorph of a Smarandache A-loop is shown to be a Smarandache K-loop.\n","Comment: 9 pages"]}]
