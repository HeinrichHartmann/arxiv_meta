The\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\nof ~73 ks.

The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\nthe optical counterpart).

We found that the\nperformance of both multiplicative and additive spread spectrum schemes depends\non the shape parameter of the host signals. For spread spectrum schemes, the\nperformance of the detector or the decoder is reduced by the host interference.\nThus I present a new host-interference rejection technique for the\nmultiplicative spread spectrum schemes.

However, by\ncoupling a superconducting qubit to signals on a microwave transmission line,\nit is possible to construct an integrated circuit where the presence or absence\nof even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. This system is called\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) because it is the circuit equivalent of\nthe atom-photon interaction in cavity QED. Previously, circuit QED devices were\nshown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit can\nabsorb and re-emit a single photon many times. Here, we report a circuit QED\nexperiment which achieves the strong dispersive limit, a new regime of cavity\nQED in which a single photon has a large effect on the qubit or atom without\never being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the\nqubit transition can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon\nnumber state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of\nthe probability to find the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This\neffect has been used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields and\ncould be used to create a photon statistics analyzer.

This is reminiscent of high-speed ballistics impact in\nthe 19th and 20th centuries, when a plethora of empirical rules were proposed.\nTo make progress, we developed a means to measure projectile dynamics with 100\nnm and 20 us precision. For a 1-inch diameter steel sphere dropped from a wide\nrange of heights into non-cohesive glass beads, we reproduce prior observations\neither as reasonable approximations or as limiting behaviours. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the interaction between projectile and medium can be\ndecomposed into the sum of velocity-dependent inertial drag plus\ndepth-dependent friction.

The MDC is defined by considering the\nsingle hole spectral function $A^<(\\vec{k},\\omega)$ as a function of $\\vec{k}$\nat a fixed frequency $\\omega$. We show the existence of a \\emph{kink} in this\ndispersion for the spin-rotationally invariant Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid at\nfinite temperature. In the repulsive regime where the charge velocity $v_{c}$\nis greater than the spin velocity $v_{s}$, the low frequency effective\nelectronic dispersion is linear in $\\vec{k}$ and follows a velocity $v_l$\nbetween the spin and charge velocities, $v_s < v_l < v_c$. The high frequency\npart (which is also linear in $\\vec{k}$) disperses with the charge velocity\n$v_c$. The energy scale of the crossover between the two velocities defines a\nkink, $E_{\\rm kink}$. In addition, the high energy dispersion extrapolates to\nthe Fermi energy at a wavevector $k_{ex} \\ne k_F$ which is shifted from the\nFermi wavevector.

Recently, work by Jarzynski, and independently by Neal, has\nshown how one can view such a product of estimates, each based on simple\nimportance sampling using a single point, as an SIS estimate on an extended\nstate space. This `Annealed Importance Sampling' (AIS) method produces an\nexactly unbiased estimate for the ratio of normalizing constants even when the\nMarkov transitions used do not reach equilibrium. In this paper, I show how a\ncorresponding `Linked Importance Sampling' (LIS) method can be constructed in\nwhich the estimates for individual ratios are similar to bridge sampling\nestimates. I show empirically that for some problems, LIS estimates are much\nmore accurate than AIS estimates found using the same computation time,\nalthough for other problems the two methods have similar performance. Linked\nsampling methods similar to LIS are useful for other purposes as well.\n"]}]

If the phase two\nsample is selected via Bernoulli (i.i.d.) sampling with known sampling\nprobabilities, standard estimating equation theory shows that the influence\nfunction for the weighted likelihood estimator of the Euclidean parameter is\nthe IPW version of the ordinary influence function.

Specifically, we show three main results: (1) ``Network\nneighbors''--those consumers linked to a prior customer--adopt the service at a\nrate 3--5 times greater than baseline groups selected by the best practices of\nthe firm's marketing team. In addition, analyzing the network allows the firm\nto acquire new customers who otherwise would have fallen through the cracks,\nbecause they would not have been identified based on traditional attributes.\n(2) Statistical models, built with a very large amount of geographic,\ndemographic and prior purchase data, are significantly and substantially\nimproved by including network information. (3) More detailed network\ninformation allows the ranking of the network neighbors so as to permit the\nselection of small sets of individuals with very high probabilities of\nadoption.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/088342306000000222 in the\n  Statistical Science (http://www.imstat.org/sts/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

Their most common use is to account\nfor within-subject correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They are also the\nstandard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data. However, when treated in\nfull generality, mixed models can also handle spline-type smoothing and closely\napproximate kriging. This allows for nonparametric regression models (e.g.,\nadditive models and varying coefficient models) to be handled within the mixed\nmodel framework. The key is to allow the random effects design matrix to have\ngeneral structure; hence our label general design. For continuous response\ndata, particularly when Gaussianity of the response is reasonably assumed,\ncomputation is now quite mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS\npackages. Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where\ngeneralized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but are hindered by the\npresence of intractable multivariate integrals. Software known to us supports\nspecial cases of the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS or glmmML in R) or relies\non the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation of integrals (e.g., the SAS\nmacro glimmix or glmmPQL in R). This paper describes the fitting of general\ndesign generalized linear mixed models. A Bayesian approach is taken and Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for estimation and inference.

Such assumptions are too strong to generally hold. Over the last decades,\na number of full longitudinal data analysis methods have become available, such\nas the linear mixed model for Gaussian outcomes, that are valid under the much\nweaker missing at random (MAR) assumption. Such a method is useful, even if the\nscientific question is in terms of a single time point, for example, the last\nplanned measurement occasion, and it is generally consistent with the\nintention-to-treat principle. The validity of such a method rests on the use of\nmaximum likelihood, under which the missing data mechanism is ignorable as soon\nas it is MAR. In this paper, we will focus on non-Gaussian outcomes, such as\nbinary, categorical or count data. This setting is less straightforward since\nthere is no unambiguous counterpart to the linear mixed model. We first provide\nan overview of the various modeling frameworks for non-Gaussian longitudinal\ndata, and subsequently focus on generalized linear mixed-effects models, on the\none hand, of which the parameters can be estimated using full likelihood, and\non generalized estimating equations, on the other hand, which is a\nnonlikelihood method and hence requires a modification to be valid under MAR.\nWe briefly comment on the position of models that assume missingness not at\nrandom and argue they are most useful to perform sensitivity analysis.

To overcome the dependence on the underlying model\nparameters, we propose that tests be based on a vector of certain weighted\nresidual empirical processes.

Just\nas experimental economics pushed the frontiers of economic thought by enabling\nthe testing of numerous theories of economic behavior in the environment of a\ncontrolled laboratory, we believe that observing, often over extended periods\nof time, real-world agents participating in market and nonmarket activity on\nthe Internet can lead us to develop and test a variety of new theories.\nInternet data gathering is not controlled experimentation. We cannot randomly\nassign participants to treatments or determine event orderings. Internet data\ngathering does offer potentially large data sets with repeated observation of\nindividual choices and action. In addition, the automated data collection holds\npromise for greatly reduced cost per observation. Our methods rely on\ntechnological advances in automated data collection agents. Significant\nchallenges remain in developing appropriate sampling techniques integrating\ndata from heterogeneous sources in a variety of formats, constructing\ngeneralizable processes and understanding legal constraints. Despite these\nchallenges, the early evidence from those who have harvested and analyzed large\namounts of e-commerce data points toward a significant leap in our ability to\nunderstand the functioning of electronic commerce.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/088342306000000231 in the\n  Statistical Science (http://www.imstat.org/sts/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

It is based on the fact that\nblock-maxima of size m of the independent and identically distributed data\nscale at a rate of m^{1/alpha}. This scaling rate can be captured well by the\nmax-spectrum plot of the data that leads to regression based estimators.\nConsistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators is established under\nmild conditions on the behavior of the tail of the distribution. The results\nare obtained by establishing bounds on the rate of convergence of moment-type\nfunctionals of heavy-tailed maxima. Such bounds often yield exact rates of\nconvergence and are of independent interest. Practical issues on the automatic\nselection of tuning parameters for the estimators and corresponding confidence\nintervals are also addressed. Extensive numerical simulations show that the\nproposed method proves competitive for both small and large sample sizes and\nfor a large range of tail exponents. The method is shown to be more robust than\nthe classical Hill plot and is illustrated on two data sets of insurance claims\nand natural gas field sizes.\n"]}]

In many\nmodern data analysis problems, statisticians are faced with large datasets\nwhere the sample size, n, is of the same order of magnitude as the number of\nvariables p. Random matrix theory predicts that in this context, the\neigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix are not good estimators of the\neigenvalues of the population covariance.\n  We propose to use a fundamental result in random matrix theory, the\nMarcenko-Pastur equation, to better estimate the eigenvalues of large\ndimensional covariance matrices. The Marcenko-Pastur equation holds in very\nwide generality and under weak assumptions. The estimator we obtain can be\nthought of as \"shrinking\" in a non linear fashion the eigenvalues of the sample\ncovariance matrix to estimate the population eigenvalue. Inspired by ideas of\nrandom matrix theory, we also suggest a change of point of view when thinking\nabout estimation of high-dimensional vectors: we do not try to estimate\ndirectly the vectors but rather a probability measure that describes them.

Finally, our clustering procedure\nhas been used in combination with discovery of evolutionarily-conserved motifs\nto predict co-regulated genes. An alternative to our Dirichlet process prior\ndistribution is explored but shows no substantive difference in the clustering\nresults for our datasets.

Thus, the most powerful test or other optimal procedure for\none model, e.g. recessive, may be quite inefficient if another model, e.g.\ndominant, describes the inheritance process. Rather than choose among the\nprocedures that are optimal for a particular model, it is preferable to see a\nmethod that has high efficiency across a family of scientifically realistic\nmodels. Statisticians well recognize that this situation is analogous to the\nselection of an estimator of location when the form of the underlying\ndistribution is not known. We review how the concepts and techniques in the\nefficiency robustness literature that are used to obtain efficiency robust\nestimators and rank tests can be adapted for the analysis of genetic data. In\nparticular, several statistics have been used to test for a genetic association\nbetween a disease and a candidate allele or marker allele from data collected\nin case-control studies.

Sometimes one can eliminate a mode of inheritance, e.g. from\nprior studies of family pedigrees one may know whether the disease skips\ngenerations or not. If it does, the disease is much more likely to follow a\nrecessive model than a dominant one.

The resulting generalized results help\nindicate why earlier results hold quite well even when the simple assumption of\nellipsoidal symmetry is not met [e.g., Biometrics 52 (1996) 249--264].\nExtensions to conditionally affinely invariant matching with conditionally\nDMPES distributions are also discussed.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/009053606000000407 in the\n  Annals of Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

A classical approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is\nto restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate\n($\\mathit{FWER}$), the probability of even one false rejection. But if $s$ is\nlarge, control of the $\\mathit{FWER}$ is so stringent that the ability of a\nprocedure that controls the $\\mathit{FWER}$ to detect false null hypotheses is\nlimited.

More generally, the rate of convergence of the\npredicted value of the mean response in the regression model, given a\nparticular value of the explanatory variable, is determined by a subtle\ninteraction among the smoothness of the predictand, of the slope function in\nthe model, and of the autocovariance function for the distribution of\nexplanatory variables.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/009053606000000830 in the\n  Annals of Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

This is arguably the simplest time series model that one can write\ndown. The MA(1) with unit root ($\\theta_0=1$) arises naturally in a variety of\ntime series applications. For example, if an underlying time series consists of\na linear trend plus white noise errors, then the differenced series is an MA(1)\nwith unit root. In such cases, testing for a unit root of the differenced\nseries is equivalent to testing the adequacy of the trend plus noise model. The\nunit root problem also arises naturally in a signal plus noise model in which\nthe signal is modeled as a random walk. The differenced series follows a MA(1)\nmodel and has a unit root if and only if the random walk signal is in fact a\nconstant. The asymptotic theory of various estimators based on Gaussian\nlikelihood has been developed for the unit root case and nearly unit root case\n($\\theta=1+\\beta/n,\\beta\\le0$). Unlike standard $1/\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotics, these\nestimation procedures have $1/n$-asymptotics and a so-called pile-up effect, in\nwhich P$(\\hat{\\theta}=1)$ converges to a positive value. One explanation for\nthis pile-up phenomenon is the lack of identifiability of $\\theta$ in the\nGaussian case. That is, the Gaussian likelihood has the same value for the two\nsets of parameter values $(\\theta,\\sigma^2)$ and $(1/\\theta,\\theta^2\\sigma^2$).\nIt follows that $\\theta=1$ is always a critical point of the likelihood\nfunction. In contrast, for non-Gaussian noise, $\\theta$ is identifiable for all\nreal values. Hence it is no longer clear whether or not the same pile-up\nphenomenon will persist in the non-Gaussian case. In this paper, we focus on\nlimiting pile-up probabilities for estimates of $\\theta_0$ based on a Laplace\nlikelihood. In some cases, these estimates can be viewed as Least Absolute\nDeviation (LAD) estimates.

How does the result depend on the ACC equipment level?\n  We discuss microscopic modeling aspects for human and automated (ACC)\ndriving. By means of microscopic traffic simulations, we study how a variable\npercentage of ACC-equipped vehicles influences the stability of traffic flow,\nthe maximum flow under free traffic conditions until traffic breaks down, and\nthe dynamic capacity of congested traffic. Furthermore, we compare different\npercentages of ACC with respect to travel times in a specific congestion\nscenario.

This results in the formation of a set of associations that\nmay be termed an organismal self-image, which provides a mechanistic basis for\nthe emergence of various behaviors that are associated with self-awareness,\nsuch as self-recognition. In humans, self-awareness includes additional\nbehaviors such as recognition of self-awareness, the concept of I, and various\nexistential and religious questions.
