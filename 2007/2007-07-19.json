The studies dealing with this phenomenon are seldom and most of the\nscientific work has been focused on flow electrification of aqueous and\ninsulating Newtonian liquids. From that prior art it is well established that\nthe flow electrification in Newtonian liquids is a consequence of the formation\nof an ionic double layer. Convection of this layer induces the electrification\nof the liquid at the outlet of the pipe. In those models, the key parameters\ngoverning the flow electrification are thus the intrinsic electrical properties\nof the polymer and the flow characteristics. In this work, we reconsider the\nassumptions made previously and we propose a new approach to modelise the flow\nelectrification in the particular case of non-Newtonian polymer materials in\nlaminar flow conditions. We establish that, a key parameter for the\nelectrification quantification in the polymer melt is the shape of the velocity\nprofile. Additionally, in some cases, we show that a slip velocity at the\npolymer/die wall interface must be considered to describe accurately the\nelectrification. As a consequence, we deduce that the slip velocity at the\ninterface can be calculated by measuring the electrification: this work gives\nan alternative manner to measure the slip velocity during polymer flow.\n"]}]

Higher level of charges are measured during the spurt or the\ngross-melt fracture (g.m.f) defects. This work is focused on the electrical\ncharging during the sharkskin instability. The variation of the electrical\ncharges versus the apparent wall shear stress is investigated for different die\ngeometries. This curve exhibits a linear increase, followed by a sudden growth\njust before the onset of the spurt instability. This abrupt charging\ncorresponds also to the end of the sharkskin instability.

Core\naccretion models reproduce this trend, since the protoplanetary disk of a high\nmetallicity star has a high density of solids and so forms cores which accrete\ngas before the primordial gas disk dissipates. This paper considers the origin\nof the form of Ppl(Z). We introduce a simple model in which detectable planets\nform when the mass of solids in the protoplanetary disk, Ms, exceeds a critical\nvalue. In this model the form of Ppl(Z) is a direct reflection of the\ndistribution of protoplanetary disk masses, Mg, and the observed Ppl(Z) is\nreproduced if P(Mg>Mg') oc 1/Mg'^2. We argue that a protoplanetary disk's\nsub-mm dust mass is a pristine indicator of the mass available for\nplanet-building and find the observed sub-mm disk mass distribution is\nconsistent with the observed Ppl(Z) if Ms>0.5M_J is required to form detectable\nplanets. Any planet formation model which imposes a critical solid mass for\nplanet formation would reproduce the observed Ppl(Z), and core accretion models\nare empirically consistent with a threshold criterion. We identify 7\nprotoplanetary disks which, by rigid application of this criterion, would be\nexpected to form detectable planets. A testable prediction is that Ppl(Z)\nshould flatten both for Z>0.5dex and as more distant and lower mass planets are\ndiscovered. Further, combining this model with one in which the evolution of a\nstar's debris disk is also influenced by the solid mass in its protoplanetary\ndisk, results in the prediction that debris disks detected around stars with\nplanets should be more infrared luminous than those around stars without\nplanets in tentative agreement with recent observations.\n","Comment: Accepted by MNRAS"]}]
