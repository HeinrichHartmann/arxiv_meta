The\nanalysis is performed adapting to continuous variables a formalism based on\nsingle subsystem unitary transformations that has been recently introduced to\ncharacterize separability and entanglement in pure states of qubits and qutrits\n[arXiv:0706.1561]. In analogy with the finite-dimensional case, we demonstrate\nthat the $1 \\times M$ bipartite entanglement of a multimode pure Gaussian state\ncan be quantified by the minimum squared Euclidean distance between the state\nitself and the set of states obtained by transforming it via suitable local\nsymplectic (unitary) operations. This minimum distance, corresponding to a,\nuniquely determined, extremal local operation, defines a novel entanglement\nmonotone equivalent to the entropy of entanglement, and amenable to direct\nexperimental measurement with linear optical schemes.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure.
