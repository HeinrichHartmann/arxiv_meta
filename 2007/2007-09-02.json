It applies to any time- and energy-tagged photon data, and can avoid\nbinning in both time and energy. The primary motivation here is the search for\nquantum gravity based dispersion in future gamma ray burst data from the Gamma\nRay Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). Extrapolation of what is know about\nbursts at lower energies yields a reasonable prospect that photon dispersion\neffects consistent with some quantum gravity formalisms may be detected in\nsufficiently bright bursts. Short bursts have no or very small inherent lags,\nand are therefore better prospects than long ones, but even they suffer\nsystematic error due to pulse asymmetry that may yield an irreducible\nuncertainty.

We\ninvestigate this key issue from both experimental (Raman scattering) and\ntheoretical (first-principles bond length and phonon calculations) sides,\nfocusing on Zn[1-x]Be[x]Se (0<x=0.92). Its large contrast in cation-anion bond\nlengths should stimulate CPSO to some extent, and is at the origin of a\nuniquely well-resolved 1-bond->2-phonon behaviour for the Be-Se species. Based\non percolation, CPSO finds a previously missing natural explanation, at the\nmesosocopic scale. Also, the transfer of oscillator strength from the high- to\nthe low-frequency Be-Se mode in the Raman spectra potentially emerges as a\nsensitive probe of CPSO in ZnBeSe. First-principles calculations indicate that\nthe transfer is completed for the value of the long range order parameter of\neta~0.5 in ZnBeSe2 (x~0.5), corresponding to a pure 1-bond->1-mode behaviour.\nWith further ordering the alloy is forced to re-adopt a non-rewarding\n1-bond->2-mode behaviour, due to the formation of ZnSe/BeSe micro-domains in\nthe crystal. Therefore eta~0.5 appears as an intrinsic limit to CPSO in\nZnBeSe2, and possibly in stoichiometric alloys in general.\n","Comment: revised version on 16 pages; 7 unchanged figures"]}]
