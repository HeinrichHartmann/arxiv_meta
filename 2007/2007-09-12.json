It has been established that this DPT falls in\nthe same universality class as the equilibrium phase transition in the\ntwo-dimensional Ising model in zero applied field. Here we study for the first\ntime the scaling of the dynamic order parameter with respect to a nonzero,\nperiod-averaged, magnetic `bias' field, H_b, for a DPT produced by a\nsquare-wave applied field. We find evidence that the scaling exponent,\n\\delta_d, of H_b at the critical period of the DPT is equal to the exponent for\nthe critical isotherm, \\delta_e, in the equilibrium Ising model. This implies\nthat H_b is a significant component of the field conjugate to Q. A finite-size\nscaling analysis of the dynamic order parameter above the critical period\nprovides further support for this result. We also demonstrate numerically that,\nfor a range of periods and values of H_b in the critical region, a\nfluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR), with an effective temperature\nT_{eff}(T, P, H_0) depending on the period, and possibly the temperature and\nfield amplitude, holds for the variables Q and H_b.

As recently recognised the maximum stellar mass in a star cluster is\nlimited by the embedded total cluster mass and, in addition, the maximum\nembedded star cluster mass is constrained by the current SFR. The combination\nof these two relations leads to an integrated galaxial initial stellar mass\nfunction (IGIMF, the IMF for the whole galaxy) which is steeper in the high\nmass regime than the constant canonical IMF, and is dependent on the SFR of the\ngalaxy.

The call-answer table is indexed on the\ncall and a signature of the state in which the call was made. The answer\ncolumns contain the answer unification and a signature of the state after the\ncall was executed. The states are signed efficiently using a technique based on\ntries and counting.

The deletions and\ninsertions (executed in the transaction oracle) change the state of the\ndatabase. Using the heuristic of inertia (only a part of the state changes in\nresponse to elementary updates), most of the time it is cheaper to compute only\nthe changes in the state than to recompute the entire state from scratch. The\ntwo methods are complementary by the fact that the first method optimizes the\nevaluation when a call is repeated in the same state, and the second method\noptimizes the evaluation of a new state when a call-state pair is not found by\nthe tabling mechanism (i.e. the first method).

We show that at 1AU the turbulence\ndecomposes linearly into two coexistent components perpendicular and parallel\nto the local average magnetic field. The first of these is consistent with\npropagating Alfv\\'{e}n wavepackets and shows the scaling expected of\nAlfv\\'{e}nic turbulence, namely Irosnikov- Kraichnan. The second shows\nKolmogorov scaling which we also find in the number and magnetic energy\ndensity, and Poynting flux.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures, submitted PRL"]}]
