In some circumstances,\nwhich are described in this paper, a large number of RNAPs move simultaneously\nalong the same track.

We apply this mechanism to several car-following\nmodels and simulate traffic breakdowns in open systems with an on-ramp as\nbottleneck. Single-vehicle data generated by several 'virtual detectors' show a\nsemi-quantitative agreement with microscopic data from the Dutch freeway A9.\nThis includes the observed distributions of the net time headways and\ntimes-to-collision for free and congested traffic. While the times-to-collision\nshow a nearly universal distribution in free and congested traffic, the modal\nvalue of the time headway distribution is shifted by a factor of about two in\ncongested conditions. Macroscopically, this corresponds to the 'capacity drop'\nat the transition from free to congested traffic. Finally, we explain the wide\nscattering of one-minute flow-density data by a self-organized variance-driven\nprocess that leads to the spontaneous formation and decay of long-lived\nplatoons even for deterministic dynamics on a single lane.\n","Comment: Submitted to Phys.

The schemes are minimal,\ni.e. they involve a single additional probe qudit, and optimal, i.e. they\nprovide the maximum amount of information compatible with a given level of\ndisturbance. The performances of optimal single-user schemes in extracting\ninformation by sequential measurements in a N -user transmission line are also\ninvestigated, and the optimality is analyzed by explicit evaluation of\nfidelities. We found that the estimation fidelity does not depend on the number\nof users, neither for single-measure inference nor for collective one, whereas\nthe transmission fidelity decreases with N . The resulting trade-off is no\nlonger optimal and degrades with increasing N . We found that optimality can be\nrestored by an effective preparation of the probe states and present explicitly\ncalculations for the 2-user case.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figure.

In such a process the emphasis is on the quantum\noperation (evolution plus measurement) necessary to retrieve the original\ninformation. We analyze, for qubit systems, the cloning of a class generated by\ntwo noncommuting observables, elucidating the relationship between such a\nprocess and joint measurements. This helps in establishing an optimality\ncriterion for cloning of observables. We see that, even if the cloning machine\nis designed to act on the whole class generated by two noncommuting\nobservables, the same optimal performances of a joint measurement can be\nattained.
