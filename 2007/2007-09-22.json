We study graphene's visibility and show that it\ndepends strongly on both thickness of silicon dioxide and light wavelength. We\nhave found that by using monochromatic illumination, graphene can be isolated\nfor any silicon dioxide thickness, albeit 300 nm (the current standard) and,\nespecially, approx. 100 nm are most suitable for its visual detection. By using\na Fresnel-law-based model, we quantitatively describe the experimental data\nwithout any fitting parameters.\n","Comment: Since v1: minor changes to text and figures to improve clarity;\n  references added.
