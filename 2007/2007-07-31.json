Given the framework of a measurement-based quantum computer, where\nquantum information is processed by local operations only, the most general\nuniversal one-way quantum computer is one which is capable of accepting\narbitrary classical inputs and producing arbitrary quantum outputs--we refer to\nthis property as CQ-universality. We then show that a systematic study of\nCQ-universality in one-way quantum computation is possible by identifying\nentanglement features that must be present in every universal resource. These\ninsights are used to identify several states as being not universal, such as 1D\ncluster states, W states, and ground states of non-critical 1D spin systems.\nOur criteria are strengthened by considering the efficiency of a quantum\ncomputation, and we find that entanglement measures must obey a certain scaling\nlaw with the system size for all efficient universal resources. This again\nleads to examples of non-universal resources, such as, e.g., ground states of\ncritical 1D spin systems. We also provide several examples of efficient\nuniversal resources, namely graph states corresponding to hexagonal, triangular\nand Kagome lattices. Finally, we consider the more general notion of encoded\nCQ-universality, where quantum outputs are allowed to be produced in an encoded\nform. Again we provide entanglement-based criteria for encoded universality.\nMoreover, we present a general procedure to construct encoded universal\nresources.\n","Comment: 50 pages"]}]
