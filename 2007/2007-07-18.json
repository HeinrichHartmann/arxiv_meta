However, new protein\nfunctions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions\nthat are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are\nneutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause\nsubstantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable\nfuture functional evolution.\n  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how\ncytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on\na single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on\nfive other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much\nas four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous\nactivities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely\nrationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The\nactivities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated\nfashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change\nin one function based on the measurement of several others.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead\nto substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under\nselection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional\nevolution should selection \"ask new questions\" in the future.\n"]}]

It is widely claimed that no\nmore than three adiabatic invariants can exist for the motion of a point\ncharge. However, additional independent (not separating) adiabatic invariants\ndo exist. For a force free motion, the components of angular momentum provide\ntwo additional constants of motion. This result can be generalized to the\nHamilton Jacobi equation. The number of independent constants of motion is\nreduced if there is a global symmetry. For a gyrating particle, neglecting a\ngyro helix type of invariant, four 'useful' invariants could exist. A radial\ndrift invariant, corresponding to the average of the radial coordinate of the\nparticle, is a constant of motion for a confined gyrating particle. For the\nspecial case of a screw pinch where each gyro center moves on a magnetic flux\nsurface without mirror trapping, the radial drift invariant is the radial\ncoordinate of the gyro center. For a screw pinch, the set of constants of\nmotion consising of the energy, parallel velocity and radial drift invariant is\nconvenient to model the equilibrium.

Recently, Marchetti, Simons, and Littlewood have used a replica trick\nto investigate the effects of disorder on the condensation of cavity\npolaritons. Within their nonlinear sigma model, it was found that the\nsaddle-point equations assume the form reported previously by Zittartz in the\ncontest of the symmetry broken excitonic insulator, but with an order\nparameter, to which both photons and excitons contribute. In this paper, we\napply a closed-path time Green's function approach as an alternative to the\nreplica technique to formulate a nonperturbative description of cavity\npolaritons in the presence of a symmetry-breaking disorder. A field theoretical\nmethod is used to derive the Schwinger-Dyson equations for the average photon\nfield and the average single-particle Green's function. In contrast with the\nnonlinear sigma model and the corresponding saddle-point equations, we obtain\nthat the exact Schwinger-Dyson equations cannot be mapped to the corresponding\nequations derived by Zittartz.
