We propose that the\nsub-parsec-scale disk of massive stars orbiting the massive black hole at the\nGalactic center can be interpreted in terms of partial accretion of extended\nGalactic center clouds, such as the 50 \\kms molecular cloud, as these clouds\nenvelop Sgr A* on their passage through the inner Galactic center. The loss of\nangular momentum of the captured cloud material by self-interaction subsequent\nto gravitationally focusing by Sgr A* naturally creates a compact gaseous disk\nof material close to Sgr A* in which star formation takes place. On a larger\nscale the formation of massive clusters such as the Arches and Quintuplet\nclusters or on-going massive star formation such as Sgr B2 could also be\ntriggered by cloud-cloud collisions due to gravitational focusing in the deep\npotential of the central bulge.\n  Unlike the violent and high-pressure environment of clustered star formation\ntriggered by cloud-cloud collision, there are also isolated pockets of star\nformation and quiescent dense clouds. These sites suggest an inefficient, slow\nmode of star formation. We propose enhanced cosmic rays in the nuclear disk may\nbe responsible for inhibiting the process of star formation in this region. In\nparticular, we argue that the enhanced ionization rate due to the impact of\ncosmic-ray particles is responsible for lowering the efficiency of on-going\nstar formation in the nuclear disk of our Galaxy. The higher ionization\nfraction and higher thermal energy due to the impact of these electrons may\nalso reduce MHD wave damping which contributes to the persistence of the high\nvelocity dispersion of the molecular gas in the nuclear disk.\n","Comment: 8 pages, one figure; in Massive Star Formation: Observations confront\n  Theory\", ASP Conference Series, ed: H.

Max CSP captures many well-known problems\n(such as Max k-SAT and Max Cut) and is consequently NP-hard. Thus, it is\nnatural to study how restrictions on the allowed constraint types (or\nconstraint languages) affect the complexity and approximability of Max CSP. The\nPCP theorem is equivalent to the existence of a constraint language for which\nMax CSP has a hard gap at location 1, i.e. it is NP-hard to distinguish between\nsatisfiable instances and instances where at most some constant fraction of the\nconstraints are satisfiable. All constraint languages, for which the CSP\nproblem (i.e., the problem of deciding whether all constraints can be\nsatisfied) is currently known to be NP-hard, have a certain algebraic property.\nWe prove that any constraint language with this algebraic property makes Max\nCSP have a hard gap at location 1 which, in particular, implies that such\nproblems cannot have a PTAS unless P = NP.
