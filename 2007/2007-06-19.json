In other words, the network is\nrewired by Hebbian learning into a new synaptic structure that emerges with\nlearning on the basis of the correlations that progressively build up between\nneurons. We also observe that, within this emerging structure, the strongest\nsynapses organize as a small-world network. The second effect of the decay of\nthe weight matrix spectral radius consists in a rapid contraction of the\nspectral radius of the Jacobian matrix.
