The energy release, E_rel, is equal to the difference in\nmass-energies between the initial (normal) phase configuration and the final\nconfiguration containing a superdense matter core, assuming constant total\nbaryon number and the angular momentum. The calculations are performed with the\nuse of precise pseudo-spectral 2-D numerical code; the polytropic equations of\nstate (EOS) as well as realistic EOSs (Skyrme interactions, Mean Field Theory\nkaon condensate) are used. The results are obtained for a broad range of\nmetastability of initial configuration and size of the new superdense phase\ncore in the final configuration. For a fixed ``overpressure'', dP, defined as\nthe relative excess of central pressure of a collapsing metastable star over\nthe pressure of the equilibrium first-order PT, the energy release up to\nnumerical accuracy does not depend on the stellar angular momentum and\ncoincides with that for nonrotating stars with the same dP. When the equatorial\nradius of the superdense phase core is much smaller than the equatorial radius\nof the star, analytical expressions for the E_rel can be obtained: E_rel is\nproportional to dP^2.5 for small dP. At higher dP, the results of 1-D\ncalculations of E_rel(dP) for non-rotating stars reproduce with very high\nprecision exact 2-D results for fast-rotating stars. The energy release-angular\nmomentum independence for a given overpressure holds also for the so-called\n``strong'' PTs (that destabilise the star against the axi-symmetric\nperturbations), as well as for PTs with ``jumping'' over the energy barrier.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, proceedings of the International Symposium on\n  Exotic States of Nuclear Matter, EXOCT07, to be published by World Scientific\n  Publishing Co"]}]
