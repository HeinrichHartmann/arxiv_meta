The Universe began as the breaking in of photons of extremely high energy\ncontained in the 3-dimensional surface: $w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2=R^2_i$, whose radius\nhas continued to expand at the speed of ligth since its origin at $t=0$.\n  3. The wavelength of the photons is quantized and the quantum of wavelength\nis invariable.\n  These propositions imply that the value of the total energy of the zero-point\nradiation in the Universe remains constant and the condition $w^2 + x^2 + y^2 +\nz^2 = (R_i + ct)^2 = R_u^2$ determines that every point in our space is subject\nto a tension whose intensity $i$ is proportional to the curvature $1/R_u$. Any\nincrease of $R_u$ implies a decrease in $i$ and consequently an energy flow\nwhich translates into an expansive force. Therefore, the Universe will expand\nindefinitely: no Big Crunch is possible.

It is the first time that the very fast motion of the peeling\npoint is imaged. The speed of the camera, up to 16000 fps, allows us to observe\nand quantify the details of the peeling point motion during the stick and slip\nphases: stick and slip velocities, durations and amplitudes. First, in contrast\nwith previous observations, the stick-slip regime appears to be only transient\nin the force controlled peeling. Additionally, we discover that the stick and\nslip phases have similar durations and that at high mean peeling velocity, the\nslip phase actually lasts longer than the stick phase. Depending on the mean\npeeling velocity, we also observe that the velocity change between stick and\nslip phase ranges from a rather sudden to a smooth transition. These new\nobservations can help to discriminate between the various assumptions used in\ntheoretical models for describing the complex peeling of an adhesive tape.
