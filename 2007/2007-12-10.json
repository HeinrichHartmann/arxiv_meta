CRASH_alpha is a version of the continuum radiative transfer\ncode CRASH with a new algorithm to follow the propagation of Ly_alpha photons\nthrough a gas configuration whose ionization structure is evolving. The\nimplementation introduces the time evolution for Ly_alpha photons (a feature\ncommonly neglected in line radiative transfer codes) and, to reduce the\ncomputational time needed to follow each scattering, adopts a statistical\napproach to the Ly_alpha treatment by making extensive use of pre-compiled\ntables. With this statistical approach we experience a drastic increase of the\ncomputational speed and, at the same time, an excellent agreement with the full\nLy_alpha radiative transfer computations of the code MCLy_alpha. We find that\nthe emerging spectra keep memory of the ionization history which generates a\ngiven ionization configuration of the gas and, to properly account for this\neffect, a self-consistent joint evolution of line and ionizing continuum\nradiation as implemented in CRASH_alpha is necessary. A comparison between the\nresults from our code and from Ly_alpha scattering alone on a fixed HI density\nfield shows that the extent of the difference between the emerging spectra\ndepends on the particular configuration considered, but it can be substantial\nand can thus affect the physical interpretation of the problem at hand.

The first postulate defines the field properties (a\nvector space continuum) of the Cosmological Vacuum in terms of matrices of\nbasis functions that map exact differentials into neighborhoods of exterior\ndifferential 1-forms (potentials). The second postulate requires that the field\nequations must satisfy the First Law of Thermodynamics dynamically created in\nterms of the Lie differential with respect to a process direction field acting\non the exterior differential forms that encode the thermodynamic system. The\nvector space of infinitesimals need not be global and its compliment is used to\ndefine particle properties as topological defects embedded in the field vector\nspace. The potentials, as exterior differential 1-forms, are not (necessarily)\nuniquely integrable: the fibers can be twisted, leading to possible Chiral\nmatrix arrays of certain 3-forms defined as Topological Torsion and Topological\nSpin.
