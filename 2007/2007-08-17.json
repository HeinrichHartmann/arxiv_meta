Statistical\nanalyses of the CMB, in conjunction with other cosmological observables,\nrepresent some of the most powerful techniques available to cosmologists for\nplacing strong constraints on the cosmological parameters that describe the\norigin, content and evolution of the Universe. The last decade has witnessed\nthe introduction of wavelet analyses in cosmology and, in particular, their\napplication to the CMB. We review here spherical wavelet analyses of the CMB\nthat test the standard cosmological concordance model. The assumption that the\ntemperature anisotropies of the CMB are a realisation of a statistically\nisotropic Gaussian random field on the sphere is questioned. Deviations from\nboth statistical isotropy and Gaussianity are detected in the reviewed works,\nsuggesting more exotic cosmological models may be required to explain our\nUniverse. We also review spherical wavelet analyses that independently provide\nevidence for dark energy, an exotic component of our Universe of which we know\nvery little currently. The effectiveness of accounting correctly for the\ngeometry of the sphere in the wavelet analysis of full-sky CMB data is\ndemonstrated by the highly significant detections of physical processes and\neffects that are made in these reviewed works.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures; JFAA invited review, in press"]}]

In this article we present\nthe rationale for the design of G and demonstrate the expressiveness of G with\ntwo case studies: porting the Standard Template Library and the Boost Graph\nLibrary from C++ to G. The design of G shares much in common with the concept\nextension proposed for the next C++ Standard (the authors participated in its\ndesign) but there are important differences described in this article.\n","Comment: 50 pages"]}]

In order to solve this problem, we introduce three\ndifferent standards of the \"simple\" shape. The first standard is that the final\nshape of the congressional districts should be of a simplest figure and we\napply a modified \"shortest split line algorithm\" where the factor of the same\npopulation is considered only. The second standard is that the gerrymandering\nshould ensure the integrity of the current administrative area as the\nconvenience for management. Thus we combine the factor of the administrative\narea with the first standard, and generate an improved model resulting in the\nnew diagram in which the perimeters of the districts are along the boundaries\nof some current counties. Moreover, the gerrymandering should consider the\ngeographic features.The third standard is introduced to describe this\nsituation. Finally, it can be proved that the difference between the supporting\nratio of a certain party in each district and the average supporting ratio of\nthat particular party in the whole state obeys the Chi-square distribution\napproximately. Consequently, we can obtain an archetypal formula to check\nwhether the gerrymandering we propose is fair.\n","Comment: 23 pages,15 figures, 2007 American mathematical modeling contest\n  \"Meritorious Winner\""]}]

When the relay\nlistens, the channel operates in the broadcast mode. The channel switches to\nthe multiple access mode when the relay transmits. If the broadcast component\nchannel is physically degraded, the half-duplex relay channel will also be\nreferred to as physically degraded. The capacity of this degraded half-duplex\nrelay channel is examined. It is shown that the block Markov coding suggested\nin the seminal paper by Cover and El Gamal can be modified to achieve capacity\nfor the degraded half-duplex relay channel. In the code construction, the\nlisten-transmit schedule of the relay is made to depend on the message to be\nsent and hence the schedule carries information itself. If the schedule is\nrestricted to be deterministic, it is shown that the capacity can be achieved\nby a simple management of information flows across the broadcast and multiple\naccess component channels.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures"]}]
