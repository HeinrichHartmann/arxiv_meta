We assume diploid genomes consisting of two\nchromosomes, and we assume that each chromosome is functional if and only if\nits base sequence is identical to some master sequence. The growth and\nreplication of the yeast cells is modeled as a first-order process, with\nfirst-order growth rate constants that are determined by whether a given genome\nconsists of zero, one, or two functional chromosomes. In the asexual pathway,\nwe assume that a given diploid cell divides into two diploids.

We also show that, at low to\nintermediate replication fidelities, sexual replication with random mating has\na higher mean fitness than asexual replication, as long as the cost for sex is\nlow. This is consistent with previous work suggesting that sexual replication\nis advantageous at high population densities, low replication rates, and\nintermediate replication fidelities.

When the pacing rate of a\nperiodic train of stimuli is increased above a critical value, the action\npotential undergoes a period-doubling bifurcation, where the resulting\nalternation of the action potential duration is known as alternans in the\nmedical literature. Existing cardiac models treat alternans either as a smooth\nor as a border-collision bifurcation. However, recent experiments in paced\ncardiac tissue reveal that the bifurcation to alternans exhibits hybrid\nsmooth/nonsmooth behaviors, which can be qualitatively described by a model of\nso-called unfolded border-collision bifurcation. In this paper, we obtain\nanalytical solutions of the unfolded border-collision model and use it to\nexplore the crossover between smooth and nonsmooth behaviors. Our analysis\nshows that the hybrid smooth/nonsmooth behavior is due to large variations in\nthe system's properties over a small interval of the bifurcation parameter,\nproviding guidance for the development of future models.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We find equally good agreement\nbetween these results and a theoretical analysis of the model in the\nlong-wavelength regime that we derive for heterogeneous environments (dimer\nchains) and general bead interactions. Our analysis encompasses\npreviously-studied examples as special cases and also provides key insights on\nthe influence of heterogeneous lattices on the properties (width and\npropagation speed) of the nonlinear wave solutions of this system.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 2 tables, 12 figures (several with multiple panels)"]}]
