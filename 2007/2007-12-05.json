We find that the longitudinal relaxation rate of the 55Mn nuclei\nin Mn12-ac becomes roughly T-independent below T = 0.8 K, and can be strongly\nsuppressed with a longitudinal magnetic field.

The transverse nuclear relaxation is also\nT-independent for T < 0.8 K, and can be explained qualitatively and\nquantitatively by the dipolar coupling between like nuclei in neighboring\nmolecules.

It focuses on two possible types of long-range interactions. The\nfirst one is to replace nearest-neighbor couplings by unrestricted Levy flights\nwith a power-law distribution P(r) ~ r^(-d-sigma) controlled by an exponent\nsigma. Similarly, the temporal evolution can be modified by introducing waiting\ntimes Dt between subsequent moves which are distributed algebraically as P(Dt)~\n(Dt)^(-1-kappa). It turns out that such systems with Levy-distributed\nlong-range interactions still exhibit a continuous phase transition with\ncritical exponents varying continuously with sigma and/or kappa in certain\nranges of the parameter space. In a field-theoretical framework such\nalgebraically distributed long-range interactions can be accounted for by\nreplacing the differential operators nabla^2 and d/dt with fractional\nderivatives nabla^sigma and (d/dt)^kappa. As another possibility, one may\nintroduce algebraically decaying long-range interactions which cannot exceed\nthe actual distance to the nearest particle. Such interactions are motivated by\nstudies of non-equilibrium growth processes and may be interpreted as Levy\nflights cut off at the actual distance to the nearest particle.

We discuss\nthe relation of the electron to the Kerr's microgeon model and argue that the\nKerr geometry may be hidden beyond the Quantum Theory. In particular, we show\nthat the Foldi-Wouthuysen `mean-position' operator of the Dirac electron is\nrelated to a complex representation of the Kerr geometry, and to a complex\nstringy source. Therefore, the complex Kerr geometry may be hidden beyond the\nDirac equation.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, based on the invited talk given at the workshop\n  `Beyond the Quantum',v. 2. added new results, title is changed"]}]
