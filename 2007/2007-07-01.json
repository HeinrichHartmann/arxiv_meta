In recent years, the\nNetworks-on-Chip (NoC) paradigm emerged as a promising solution to interconnect\nchallenges in silicon-based electronics. Current NoC architectures are either\nhighly regular or fully customized, both of which represent implausible\nassumptions for emerging bottom-up self-assembled molecular electronics that\nare generally assumed to have a high degree of irregularity and imperfection.\nHere, we pragmatically and experimentally investigate important design\ntrade-offs and properties of an irregular, abstract, yet physically plausible\n3D small-world interconnect fabric that is inspired by modern network-on-chip\nparadigms. We vary the framework's key parameters, such as the connectivity,\nthe number of switch nodes, the distribution of long- versus short-range\nconnections, and measure the network's relevant communication characteristics.\nWe further explore the robustness against link failures and the ability and\nefficiency to solve a simple toy problem, the synchronization task. The results\nconfirm that (1) computation in irregular assemblies is a promising and\ndisruptive computing paradigm for self-assembled nano-scale electronics and (2)\nthat 3D small-world interconnect fabrics with a power-law decaying distribution\nof shortcut lengths are physically plausible and have major advantages over\nlocal 2D and 3D regular topologies.\n"]}]
