The gravitational field of the system is\ndominated by the black hole in its sphere of influence. It is further modified\nby the cluster mean field (a spherical term) and a gaseous disc/torus (an\naxially symmetric term) causing a secular evolution of stellar orbits via Kozai\noscillations. Intermittent phases of large eccentricity increase the chance\nthat stars become damaged inside the tidal radius of the central hole. Such\nevents can produce debris and lead to recurring episodes of enhanced accretion\nactivity. We introduce an effective loss cone and associate it with tidal\ndisruptions during the high-eccentricity phases of the Kozai cycle. By\nnumerical integration of the trajectories forming the boundary of the loss cone\nwe determine its shape and volume. We also include the effect of relativistic\nadvance of pericentre. The potential of the disc has the efffect of enlarging\nthe loss cone and, therefore, the predicted number of tidally disrupted stars\nshould grow by factor of ~10^2. On the other hand, the effect of the cluster\nmean potential together with the relativistic pericentre advance act against\nthe eccentricity oscillations. In the end we expect the tidal disruption events\nto be approximately ten times more frequent in comparison with the model in\nwhich the three effects -- the cluster mean field, the relativistic pericentre\nadvance, and the Kozai mechanism -- are all ignored. The competition of\ndifferent influences suppresses the predicted star disruption rate as the black\nhole mass increases. Hence, the process under consideration is more important\nfor intermediate-mass black holes, M_bh~10^4M_s.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures; Astronomy & Astrophysics accepted"]}]

Non-classical correlations and their applications"],"description":["  In the first part of this thesis Bell's theorem is revisited. It points at a\ndifference between the quantum and the classical world. This difference is\noften behind the advantages of solutions using quantum mechanics. New and more\ngeneral versions of Bell inequalities are presented. These inequalities involve\nmultiple settings per observer. Compared with the two-setting inequalities, the\nnew ones reveal the non-classical character of a broader class of states. Some\nof them are also proven to be optimal (tight). Next, we go beyond Bell's\ntheorem. It is shown, both in theory and in experiment, that incompatibility\nbetween quantum mechanics and realistic theories can be extended into an\nimportant class of nonlocal models. We also show that the violation of Bell\ninequalities disqualifies local realistic models with a limited lack of the\nexperimenter's freedom. This, at first glance quite philosophical result, has\nits down-to-earth implications for quantum communication. In the second part of\nthe thesis well-known examples of quantum communication are reviewed. Next, new\nresults concerning quantum cryptography and quantum communication complexity\nare given.\n","Comment: PhD thesis. University of Gdansk. 97 pages, 10 figures"]}]

We revisit fast addition algorithms in the Jacobian of C due to\nKhuri-Makdisi (math.NT/0409209, to appear in Math. Comp.). The algorithms,\nwhich reduce to linear algebra in vector spaces of dimension O(g) once |K| >>\ng, and which asymptotically require O(g^{2.376}) field operations using fast\nlinear algebra, are shown to perform efficiently even for certain low genus\ncurves. Specifically, we provide explicit formulae for performing the group law\non Jacobians of C_{3,4} curves of genus 3. We show that, typically, the\naddition of two distinct elements in the Jacobian of a C_{3,4} curve requires\n117 multiplications and 2 inversions in K, and an element can be doubled using\n129 multiplications and 2 inversions in K. This represents an improvement of\napproximately 20% over previous methods.\n","Comment: 25 pages, identical to version 2 except for a remark about the\n  published version of the article, which includes Magma code for the\n  algorithms"]}]

Pairs of\ndegenerate photons at telecom wavelength are created by parametric down\nconversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. The photon pairs\nare separated in a beam-splitter and transmitted via two fibers of 25km. The\nwave-packets are relatively delayed and recombined on a second beam-splitter,\nforming a large Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Coincidence counts between the\nphotons at the two output modes are registered. The main challenge consists in\nthe trade-off between low count rates due to narrow filtering and length\nfluctuations of the 25km long arms during the measurement. For balanced paths a\nHong-Ou-Mandel dip with a visibility of 47.3% is observed, which is close to\nthe maximal theoretical value of 50% developed here.
