Tresser in the nineteen-seventieth to study the\nasymptotic small scale geometry of the attractor of one-dimensional systems\nwhich are at the transition from simple to chaotic dynamics. This geometry\nturns out to not depend on the choice of the map under rather mild smoothness\nconditions. The existence of a unique renormalization fixed point which is also\nhyperbolic among generic smooth enough maps plays a crucial role in the\ncorresponding renormalization theory. The uniqueness and hyperbolicity of the\nrenormalization fixed point were first shown in the holomorphic context, by\nmeans that generalize to other renormalization operators. It was then proved\nthat in the space of $C^{2+\\alpha}$ unimodal maps, for $\\alpha$ close to one,\nthe period doubling renormalization fixed point is hyperbolic as well. In this\npaper we study what happens when one approaches from below the minimal\nsmoothness thresholds for the uniqueness and for the hyperbolicity of the\nperiod doubling renormalization generic fixed point. Indeed, our main results\nstates that in the space of $C^2$ unimodal maps the analytic fixed point is not\nhyperbolic and that the same remains true when adding enough smoothness to get\na priori bounds. In this smoother class, called $C^{2+|\\cdot|}$ the failure of\nhyperbolicity is tamer than in $C^2$. Things get much worse with just a bit\nless of smoothness than $C^2$ as then even the uniqueness is lost and other\nasymptotic behavior become possible. We show that the period doubling\nrenormalization operator acting on the space of $C^{1+Lip}$ unimodal maps has\ninfinite topological entropy.\n"]}]

Asian options are derivative contracts in which the underlying\nvariable is the average price of given assets sampled over a period of time.\nDue to this structure, Asian options display a lower volatility and are\ntherefore cheaper than their standard European counterparts. This paper is a\nsurvey of some recent enhancements to improve efficiency when pricing Asian\noptions by Monte Carlo simulation in the Black-Scholes model. We analyze the\ndynamics with constant and time-dependent volatilities of the underlying asset\nreturns. We present a comparison between the precision of the standard Monte\nCarlo method (MC) and the stratified Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS).

We study a\ndouble scaling limit: the size of the block is much larger then 1 but much\nsmaller then the length of the whole chain. In this limit, the entropy of the\nblock approaches a constant. The limiting entropy is a function of the\nanisotropy and of the magnetic field. The entropy reaches minima at product\nstates and increases boundlessly at phase transitions.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure"]}]

This changes the radiation properties of an atom as well as the\nlight forces acting on an atom. It has profound consequences in the\nstrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. For a single atom\ntrapped inside the cavity, we investigate the atom-cavity system by scanning\nthe frequency of a probe laser for various atom-cavity detunings. The avoided\ncrossing between atom and cavity resonance is visible in the transmission of\nthe cavity. It is also visible in the loss rate of the atom from the\nintracavity dipole trap. On the normal-mode resonances, the dominant\ncontribution to the loss rate originates from dipole-force fluctuations which\nare dramatically enhanced in the cavity. This conclusion is supported by\nMonte-Carlo simulations.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures"]}]
