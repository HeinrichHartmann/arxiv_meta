We present a model of the formation of\ndetached shells around thermal pulse asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars,\nbased on detailed modelling of mass loss and stellar evolution, leading to a\ncombination of eruptive mass loss and wind interaction.\n  The purpose of this paper is first of all to connect stellar evolution with\nwind and mass loss evolution and demonstrate its consistency with observations,\nbut also to show how thin detached shells around TP-AGB stars can be formed.\nPrevious attempts to link mass loss evolution with the formation of detached\nshells were based on approximate prescriptions for the mass loss and have not\nincluded detailed modelling of the wind formation as we do here.

The algorithmic complexity for exhibiting a basis of\nsuch a lattice is of order exp(nlogn), which improves upon previous theorems\nthat yield an equivalent lattice packing density.
