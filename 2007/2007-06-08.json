Usually this issue is addressed in the inflationary\ncontext, but trans-Planckian reasoning is much broader. We examine this logic\nin a simple example of scalar quantum field theory in the expanding and\ncontracting Milne universes, where wavelengths of the eigenmodes are red- or\nblue-shifted.

In contrast to this, the\ntrans-Planckian modification of the energy momentum tensor is not motivated. We\nprovide a similar argument for the expanding Milne universe, where the energy\nmomentum tensor in the conformal vacuum is non-zero.
