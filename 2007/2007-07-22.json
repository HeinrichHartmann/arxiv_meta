Molecule itself is\ntreated as a quantum dot with discrete energy levels, its connection to the\nelectrodes is described within the wide-band approximation, while the charging\nis incorporated by means of the self-consistent potential. Nonperturbative\ncomputational scheme, used in this work, is based on the Green's function\ntheory within the framework of mapping technique (GFT-MT). This method\ntransforms the many-body electron-phonon interaction problem into a one-body\nmulti-channel single-electron scattering problem with occupation of polaron\nlevels calculated in the self-consistent way. In particular, three different\nphenomena as a result of charging in polaronic transport via discrete quantum\nstates are discussed in detail: the suppression of the current at higher\nvoltages, negative differential resistance (NDR effect), and rectification.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures"]}]

We examine several subcases of this most\ngeneral problem taking into account the processing capability of the relays\n(half-duplex or full-duplex), and the network geometry (clustered or\nnon-clustered). We first study the multiple antenna relay channel with a\nfull-duplex relay to understand the effect of increased degrees of freedom in\nthe direct link. We find DMT upper bounds and investigate the achievable\nperformance of decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF)\nprotocols. Our results suggest that while DF is DMT optimal when all terminals\nhave one antenna each, it may not maintain its good performance when the\ndegrees of freedom in the direct link is increased, whereas CF continues to\nperform optimally. We also study the multiple antenna relay channel with a\nhalf-duplex relay. We show that the half-duplex DMT behavior can significantly\nbe different from the full-duplex case. We find that CF is DMT optimal for\nhalf-duplex relaying as well, and is the first protocol known to achieve the\nhalf-duplex relay DMT. We next study the multiple-access relay channel (MARC)\nDMT. Finally, we investigate a system with a single source-destination pair and\nmultiple relays, each node with a single antenna, and show that even under the\nidealistic assumption of full-duplex relays and a clustered network, this\nvirtual multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system can never fully mimic a real\nMIMO DMT. For cooperative systems with multiple sources and multiple\ndestinations the same limitation remains to be in effect.\n","Comment: version 1: 58 pages, 15 figures, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory, version 2: Final version, to appear IEEE IT, title\n  changed, extra figures added"]}]
