Here\nthe daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent\nresult of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals\nobserved in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the\nSun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it\nmoves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the\niodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles\nfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric\norbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb\noriginates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg\ninto near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the\nSun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories\ntraverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases\nthe probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.\nCorroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields\n~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.\n","Comment: 12 pages including 5 figures"]}]
