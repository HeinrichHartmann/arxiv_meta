The primary focus of our investigation is to introduce a suitable\nnotion of the normal trace of any divergence-measure field $\\FF$ over the\nboundary of an arbitrary set of finite perimeter, which ensures the validity of\nthe Gauss-Green theorem. To achieve this, we establish a fundamental\napproximation theorem which states that, given a Radon measure $\\mu$ that is\nabsolutely continuous with respect to $\\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$ on $\\rn$, any set of\nfinite perimeter can be approximated by a family of sets with smooth boundary\nessentially from the measure-theoretic interior of the set with respect to the\nmeasure $\\|\\mu\\|$. With this approximation theorem, we derive the normal trace\nof $\\FF$ on the boundary of any set of finite perimeter, (E), as the limit of\nthe normal traces of $\\FF$ on the boundaries of the approximate sets with\nsmooth boundary, so that the Gauss-Green theorem for $\\FF$ holds on (E). With\nthese results, we analyze the Cauchy fluxes that are bounded by a Radon measure\nover any oriented surface (i.e. an $(N-1)$-dimensional surface that is a part\nof the boundary of a set of finite perimeter) and thereby develop a general\nmathematical formulation of the physical principle of balance law through the\nCauchy flux. Finally, we apply this framework to the derivation of systems of\nbalance laws with measure-valued source terms from the formulation of balance\nlaw. This framework also allows the recovery of Cauchy entropy fluxes through\nthe Lax entropy inequality for entropy solutions of hyperbolic conservation\nlaws.\n","Comment: 43 pages"]}]

Here, Takeuti's formulation is extended to construct a model of set\ntheory based on the logic represented by the lattice of projections in an\narbitrary von Neumann algebra. A transfer principle is established that enables\nus to transfer theorems of ZFC to their quantum counterparts holding in the\nmodel. The set of real numbers in the model is shown to be in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the set of self-adjoint operators affiliated with the von\nNeumann algebra generated by the logic. Despite the difficulty pointed out by\nTakeuti that equality axioms do not generally hold in quantum set theory, it is\nshown that equality axioms hold for any real numbers in the model. It is also\nshown that any observational proposition in quantum mechanics can be\nrepresented by a corresponding statement for real numbers in the model with the\ntruth value consistent with the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, and\nthat the equality relation between two real numbers in the model is equivalent\nwith the notion of perfect correlation between corresponding observables\n(self-adjoint operators) in quantum mechanics.
