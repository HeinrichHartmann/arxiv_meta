Brownian motion is one such model,\nand since rates cannot become negative, a log Brownian model seems appropriate.\nDivergence time estimates can then be made using weighted least squares\npenalties. As sequences become long, this approach effectively becomes\nequivalent to penalized likelihood or Bayesian approaches. Different forms of\nthe least squares penalty are considered to take into account correlation due\nto shared ancestors. It is shown that a scale parameter is also needed since\nthe sum of squares changes with the scale of time. Errors or uncertainty on\nfossil calibrations, may be folded in with errors due to the stochastic nature\nof Brownian motion and ancestral polymorphism, giving a total sum of squares to\nbe minimized.

Their\ncomparison has shown large discrepancies. The comparison is extended here to\ninstant- and front-form calculations in unusual momentum configurations as well\nas to a point-form approach inspired from the Dirac's one (based on a\nhyperboloid surface). It is found that these new results depend on the momentum\ntransfer, Q, through its ratio to the total mass, Q/M, (closely related to the\nBreit-frame velocity of the system). They evidence features similar for a part\nto those shown by an earlier ``point-form'' implementation (based on\nhyperplanes perpendicular to the velocity of the initial and final states). It\nthus appears that the standard instant- and front-form calculations, which\ngenerally do well compared either to experiment or to predictions of a\ntheoretical model, rather represent exceptional cases. An argument explaining\nthe success of these last approaches is presented and discussed. It is based on\ntransformations of currents under Poincar\\'e space-time translations, going\nbeyond the energy-momentum conservation property which results from the\nLagrangian invariance under them. Depending on the approach, analytic or\napproximate numerical methods are proposed to correct form factors for missing\nconstraints then expected.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 12 figures, to be submitted.
