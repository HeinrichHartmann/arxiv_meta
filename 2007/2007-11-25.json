The proofs of such results\nare usually rather difficult, involving hard computations specific to the model\nin question. In this article we attempt to formulate a unified technique for\nderiving such results via relatively soft arguments. In the process, we\nintroduce a notion of `second order Poincar\\'e inequalities': just as ordinary\nPoincar\\'e inequalities give variance bounds, second order Poincar\\'e\ninequalities give central limit theorems. The proof of the main result employs\nStein's method of normal approximation. A number of examples are worked out,\nsome of which are new. One of the new results is a CLT for the spectrum of\ngaussian Toeplitz matrices.\n","Comment: 37 pages. To appear in PTRF"]}]

The presented analysis relies heavily on the\nSamuelsson-Andersson identification of the QPOs frequency from the range 30-200\nHz with those for torsional nodeless vibrations of multipole degree in the\ninterval 2-12. Based on this identification, which is used to fix the input\nparameters entering the obtained spectral formulae, we compute frequency\nspectrum of nodeless spheroidal elastic vibrations. Particular attention is\ngiven to the low-frequency QPOs in the data for SGR 1806-20 whose physical\norigin has been called into question. Our calculations suggest that these\nunspecified QPOs are due to nodeless dipole torsional (18 Hz) and dipole\nspheroidal (26 Hz) elastic shear vibrations.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures, corrected typos"]}]

This new equation possesses a dimensionless gravitational\ncoupling constant, and passes all experimental tests that also passes general\nrelativity. This quantum gravity and general relativity diverge essentially in\nthe domain of cosmology : we prove that quantum gravity gives the solution to\nthe whole set of problems left over by the standard cosmological model based on\ngeneral relativity. Essentially, we prove that the initial singularity, the big\nbang, is smoothed out by quantum gravity, that the flatness problem finds a\nprecise solution : quantum gravity predicts that Omega should be just a little\ngreater than 1, which fits perfectly with the observed 1.02. The cosmological\nconstant problem finds also its solution since we prove that the Lambda term\ndoes not come from any dark energy, but comes from nonperturbative quantum\ncorrections to classical relativity, and has the exact tiny but strictly\npositive value needed. Furthermore, the quantum equation of gravity possesses,\nwith no further efforts, features of unification. Indeed, our equation governs\nat the same time the large scale of the universe, as did general relativity,\nbut also the structure of particles.\n","Comment: 108 pages"]}]

Here, we investigate some properties of\nthe trapping/untrapping mechanism of a single particle into/outside the\ncluster. Since the single particle dynamics of the HMF model resembles the one\nof a simple pendulum, each particle can be identified as a high-energy particle\n(HEP) or a low-energy particle (LEP), depending on whether its energy is above\nor below the separatrix energy. We then define the trapping ratio as the ratio\nof the number of LEP to the total number of particles and the\n``fully-clustered'' and ``excited'' dynamical states as having either no HEP or\nat least one HEP. We analytically compute the phase-space average of the\ntrapping ratio by using the Boltzmann-Gibbs stable stationary solution of the\nVlasov equation associated with the $N \\to \\infty$ limit of the HMF model. The\nsame quantity, obtained numerically as a time average, is shown to be in very\ngood agreement with the analytical calculation. Another important feature of\nthe dynamical behavior of the system is that the dynamical state changes\ntransitionally: the ``fully-clustered'' and ``excited'' states appear in turn.\nWe find that the distribution of the lifetime of the ``fully-clustered'' state\nobeys a power law. This means that clusters die hard, and that the excitation\nof a particle from the cluster is not a Poisson process and might be controlled\nby some type of collective motion with long memory. Such behavior should not be\nspecific of the HMF model and appear also in systems where {\\it itinerancy}\namong different ``quasi-stationary'' states has been observed. It is also\npossible that it could mimick the behavior of transient motion in molecular\nclusters or some observed deterministic features of chemical reactions.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures"]}]
