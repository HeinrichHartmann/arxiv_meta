We generalize these results by introducing a\ngeometric object: the stratification of laminations. It is a stratification\nwhose strata are laminations. Our main theorem implies the persistence of some\nstratifications whose strata are normally expanded. The dynamics is a\n$C^r$-endomorphism of a manifold (which is possibly not invertible). The\npersistence means that for any $C^r$-perturbation of the dynamics, there exists\na close $C^r$-stratification preserved by the perturbation. This theorem in its\nelementary statement (the stratification is constituted by a unique stratum)\ngives the persistence of normally expanded laminations by endomorphisms,\ngeneralizing HPS theory. Another application of this theorem is the\npersistence, as stratifications, of submanifolds with boundary or corners\nnormally expanded. Moreover, we remark that SA diffeomorphism gives a canonical\nstratifications: the stratification whose strata are the stable sets of basic\npieces of the spectral decomposition.

In this paper we argue that the physical understanding of\nthe second solar spectrum requires the consideration of scattering processes in\nmultilevel atomic models, taking fully into account the transfer of atomic\npolarization among all the levels involved. The consideration of lower-level\natomic polarization leads to non-linear and non-local coupled sets of\nequations, even for the two-level model atom case considered in this paper. The\nunknowns of the problem are the irreducible tensor components of the atomic\ndensity matrix whose self-consistent values have first to be obtained to be\nable to calculate the emergent Stokes profiles. To solve numerically this\nnon-LTE problem of the second kind we present some iterative methods that are\nvery suitable for developing a general multilevel scattering polarization code.\nWe demonstrate that there exists metastable-level atomic polarization in the\nsolar chromosphere, which suggests that the solution to some\nrecently-formulated \"paradoxes\" is to be found by carefully revising our\ncurrent ideas about the chromospheric magnetic field.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures"]}]

However, for a certain type of (sufficiently) good codes an efficient\ndecoding algorithm with near optimal performance exists. These codes are\ndefined via a combination of constituent codes with low complexity trellis\nrepresentations. Their decoding algorithm is an instance of (loopy) belief\npropagation and is based on an iterative transfer of constituent beliefs. The\nbeliefs are thereby given by the symbol probabilities computed in the\nconstituent trellises. Even though weak constituent codes are employed close to\noptimal performance is obtained, i.e., the encoder/decoder pair (almost)\nachieves the information theoretic capacity. However, (loopy) belief\npropagation only performs well for a rather specific set of codes, which limits\nits applicability.\n  In this paper a generalisation of iterative decoding is presented. It is\nproposed to transfer more values than just the constituent beliefs. This is\nachieved by the transfer of beliefs obtained by independently investigating\nparts of the code space. This leads to the concept of discriminators, which are\nused to improve the decoder resolution within certain areas and defines\ndiscriminated symbol beliefs. It is shown that these beliefs approximate the\noverall symbol probabilities. This leads to an iteration rule that (below\nchannel capacity) typically only admits the solution of the overall decoding\nproblem.

Let $t$ be a formal parameter\nwhich commutes with $z$ and elements of $K$. We denote uniformly by $\\kzz$ and\n$\\kttzz$ the formal power series algebras of $z$ over $K$ and $K[[t]]$,\nrespectively. For any $\\alpha \\geq 1$, let $\\cDazz$ be the unital algebra\ngenerated by the differential operators of $\\kzz$ which increase the degree in\n$z$ by at least $\\alpha-1$ and $ \\ataz $ the group of automorphisms\n$F_t(z)=z-H_t(z)$ of $\\kttzz$ with $o(H_t(z))\\geq \\alpha$ and $H_{t=0}(z)=0$.\nFirst, for any fixed $\\alpha \\geq 1$ and $F_t\\in \\ataz$, we introduce five\nsequences of differential operators of $\\kzz$ and show that their generating\nfunctions form a $\\mathcal N$CS (noncommutative symmetric) system [Z4] over the\ndifferential algebra $\\cDazz$. Consequently, by the universal property of the\n$\\mathcal N$CS system formed by the generating functions of certain NCSFs\n(noncommutative symmetric functions) first introduced in [GKLLRT], we obtain a\nfamily of Hopf algebra homomorphisms $\\cS_{F_t}: {\\mathcal N}Sym \\to \\cDazz$\n$(F_t\\in \\ataz)$, which are also grading-preserving when $F_t$ satisfies\ncertain conditions. Note that, the homomorphisms $\\cS_{F_t}$ above can also be\nviewed as specializations of NCSFs by the differential operators of $\\kzz$.\nSecondly, we show that, in both commutative and noncommutative cases, this\nfamily $\\cS_{F_t}$ (with all $n\\geq 1$ and $F_t\\in \\ataz$) of differential\noperator specializations can distinguish any two different NCSFs. Some\nconnections of the results above with the quasi-symmetric functions ([Ge],\n[MR], [S]) are also discussed.\n","Comment: Latex, 33 pages. Some mistakes and misprints have been corrected"]}]
