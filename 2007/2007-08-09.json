In particular, we establish entropy estimates\ncharacterizing the asymptotic distribution of combinatorially inequivalent\ntriangulated $3$-manifolds, as the number of tetrahedra diverges. Moreover, we\noffer a rather detailed presentation of how spaces of three-dimensional\nriemannian manifolds with natural bounds on curvatures, diameter, and volume\ncan be used to prove that three-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity is\nconnected to a Gaussian model determined by the simple homotopy types of the\nunderlying manifolds. This connection is determined by a Gaussian measure\ndefined over the general linear group $GL({\\bf R},\\infty)$. It is shown that\nthe partition function of three-dimensional simplicial quantum gravity is\nwell-defined, in the thermodynamic limit, for a suitable range of values of the\ngravitational and cosmological coupling constants. Such values are determined\nby the Reidemeister-Franz torsion invariants associated with an orthogonal\nrepresentation of the fundamental groups of the set of manifolds considered.\nThe geometrical system considered shows also critical behavior, and in such a\ncase the partition function is exactly evaluated and shown to be equal to the\nReidemeister-Franz torsion. The phase structure in the thermodynamical limit is\nalso discussed. In particular, there are either phase transitions describing\nthe passage from a simple homotopy type to another, and (first order) phase\ntransitions within a given simple homotopy type which seem to confirm, on an\nanalytical ground, the picture suggested by numerical simulations.\n","Comment: 78 pages, latex"]}]
