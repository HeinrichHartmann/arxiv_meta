It is normally assumed that, following the merger of two massive\ngalaxies, a SMBH binary will form, shrink due to stellar or gas dynamical\nprocesses and ultimately coalesce by emitting a burst of gravitational waves.\nHowever, so far it has not been possible to show how two SMBHs bind during a\ngalaxy merger with gas due to the difficulty of modeling a wide range of\nspatial scales. Here we report hydrodynamical simulations that track the\nformation of a SMBH binary down to scales of a few light years following the\ncollision between two spiral galaxies. A massive, turbulent nuclear gaseous\ndisk arises as a result of the galaxy merger. The black holes form an eccentric\nbinary in the disk in less than a million years as a result of the\ngravitational drag from the gas rather than from the stars.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Science, 40 pages, 7 figures,\n  Supplementary Information included"]}]

When\nsubjected to a lateral force, these clusters should slide with an amount of\nfriction that could be measured. We examine the hypothetical possibility to\nmeasure by Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) the phononic sliding friction of\ngold clusters in the size range around 250 atoms on a graphite substrate\nbetween 300 and 600 K. Assuming the validity of Einstein's relations of\nordinary Brownian motion and making use of the experimentally available\nactivated behavior of the diffusion coefficients, we can predict the sliding\nfriction and slip times as a function of temperature. It is found that a\nprototypical deposited gold cluster could yield slip times in the standard\nmeasurable size of 10^(-9) sec for temperatures around 450-500 K, or 200 C.\nSince gold nanoclusters may also melt around these temperatures, QCM would\noffer the additional chance to observe this phenomenon through a frictional\nchange.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures.

The zero temperature\ndependence of the neutron and proton spin polarization parameters as functions\nof density is found for SkM$^*$, SGII (symmetric case) and SLy4, SLy5 (strongly\nasymmetric case) effective forces. By comparing free energy densities, it is\nshown that in symmetric nuclear matter ferromagnetic spin state (parallel\norientation of neutron and proton spins) is more preferable than\nantiferromagnetic one (antiparallel orientation of spins). Strongly asymmetric\nnuclear matter undergoes at some critical density a phase transition to the\nstate with the oppositely directed spins of neutrons and protons while the\nstate with the same direction of spins does not appear. In comparison with\nneutron matter, even small admixture of protons strongly decreases the\nthreshold density of spin instability. It is clarified that protons become\ntotally polarized within a very narrow density domain while the density profile\nof the neutron spin polarization parameter is characterized by the appearance\nof long tails near the transition density.\n","Comment: The article for Nova Science Publishers (NY) volume \"Progress in\n  Ferromagnetism Research\", 18 pages, 6 figures"]}]
