This problem had became popular after the discovery of high-Tc\nsuperconductors because the fluctuation phenomena are much stronger in the HTSC\nthan in the conventional superconductors. Most people are sure that this sharp\ntransition was observed for the present only in HTSC and are ignorant that it\nwas observed as far back as 1981, before the HTSC discovery. In the last years\nsome papers devoted to the problem of vortex lattice melting in conventional\nsuperconductors were published. The authors of these papers and others should\nbe aware of the result obtained before the HTSC discovery. It was found first\nin the presented paper that the transition into the Abrikosov vortex state is\nvery narrow in high quality samples with weak pinning and it is observed below\nthe second critical field. These results signify that this phase transition can\nbe first-order and it is not connected directly with appearance of a finite\ndensity of superconducting pairs.\n","Comment: 2 pages, 1 figure"]}]

Visualization would be helpful for obtaining immediate\ninformation about structural organization. In this work, metabolic networks of\n75 organisms were investigated from a topological point of view. A spread\nbow-tie model was proposed to give a clear visualization of the bow-tie\nstructure for metabolic networks. The revealed topological pattern helps to\ndesign more efficient algorithm specifically for metabolic networks. This\ncoarse-grained graph also visualizes the vulnerable connections in the network,\nand thus could have important implication for disease studies and drug target\nidentifications. In addition, analysis on the reciprocal links and main cores\nin the GSC part of bow-tie also reveals that the bow-tie structure of metabolic\nnetworks has its own intrinsic and significant features which are significantly\ndifferent from those of random networks.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 5 figures"]}]
