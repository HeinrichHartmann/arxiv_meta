Recently, a powerful new\nalgorithm called Affinity Propagation (AP) based on message-passing techniques\nwas proposed by Frey and Dueck \\cite{Frey07}. In AP, each cluster is identified\nby a common exemplar all other data points of the same cluster refer to, and\nexemplars have to refer to themselves. Albeit its proved power, AP in its\npresent form suffers from a number of drawbacks. The hard constraint of having\nexactly one exemplar per cluster restricts AP to classes of regularly shaped\nclusters, and leads to suboptimal performance, {\\it e.g.}, in analyzing gene\nexpression data. Results: This limitation can be overcome by relaxing the AP\nhard constraints. A new parameter controls the importance of the constraints\ncompared to the aim of maximizing the overall similarity, and allows to\ninterpolate between the simple case where each data point selects its closest\nneighbor as an exemplar and the original AP. The resulting soft-constraint\naffinity propagation (SCAP) becomes more informative, accurate and leads to\nmore stable clustering. Even though a new {\\it a priori} free-parameter is\nintroduced, the overall dependence of the algorithm on external tuning is\nreduced, as robustness is increased and an optimal strategy for parameter\nselection emerges more naturally. SCAP is tested on biological benchmark data,\nincluding in particular microarray data related to various cancer types. We\nshow that the algorithm efficiently unveils the hierarchical cluster structure\npresent in the data sets. Further on, it allows to extract sparse gene\nexpression signatures for each cluster.\n","Comment: 11 pages, supplementary material:\n  http://isiosf.isi.it/~weigt/scap_supplement.pdf"]}]

Indeed, the masses distributions inside the Earth govern the\nbehaviour of the rotation axis in space (precession-nutation) and in the Earth\n(polar motion), as well as the Earth rotation rate (or equivalently, length of\nthe day). These distributions of masses can be measured by space owing to\nartificial satellites, the orbitography of which provides the Earth gravity\nfield determination. Then, the temporal variations of the Earth gravity field\ncan be related to the variations of the Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP)\n(with the Inertia Tensor). Nowadays, the Earth orientation measurements in\nspace, obtained with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), have a precision\nbetter than the milliarcsecond level. It is then necessary to consider all the\ngeophysical sources that can improve the models precision. The goal of my PhD\nThesis was to use the Earth gravity field measurements, as well as its\nvariations, as a tool to improve the Earth orientation modelisation. We present\nhere the results obtained as well as various proposals to extend these\ninvestigations (numerical studies, the use of J2 geophysical series,\nintegration of GRACE data ...).\n"]}]

This provides a simplified\nanalysis in which the inner and outer solutions are governed by distinct\nmechanics.

The outer solution determines the\nradiation of energy away from the tip, and requires solving dynamic equations\nin the unperturbed configuration. The outer and inner expansions are matched\nvia the small parameter L/l defined by the disparate length scales: the crack\nperturbation length L and the outer length scale l associated with the loading.\nThe method is first illustrated for a scalar crack model and then applied to\nthe elastodynamic mode I problem.\n  The dispersion relation for crack front waves is found by requiring that the\nenergy release rate is unaltered under perturbation. The wave speed is\ncalculated as a function of the nondimensional parameter kl where k is the\ncrack front wavenumber, and dispersive properties of the crack front wave speed\nare described for the first time.
