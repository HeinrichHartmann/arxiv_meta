We have obtained Keck spectroscopy of a\nsample of ~200 HII regions in M33, with 61 detections of the [O III] 4363 A\nline that can be used for determining electron temperatures, including\nmeasurements at small galactocentric radii where auroral lines are generally\ndifficult to detect. We find an oxygen abundance gradient of -0.027 +/- 0.012\ndex/kpc, in agreement with infrared measurements of the neon abundance gradient\nbut much shallower than most previous oxygen gradient measurements. There is\nsubstantial intrinsic scatter of 0.11 dex in the metallicity at any given\nradius in M33, which imposes a fundamental limit on the accuracy of gradient\nmeasurements that rely on small samples of objects. Finally, we present a\ntwo-dimensional map of oxygen abundances across the southern half of M33 and\ndiscuss the evidence for deviations from axisymmetry.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, uses asp2006.sty.

This paper presents a new\ntheoretic foundation for cross-layer optimization, which allows each layer to\nmake autonomous decisions individually, while maximizing the utility of the\nwireless user by optimally determining what information needs to be exchanged\namong layers. Hence, this cross-layer framework does not change the current\nlayered architecture. Specifically, because the wireless user interacts with\nthe environment at various layers of the protocol stack, the cross-layer\noptimization problem is formulated as a layered Markov decision process (MDP)\nin which each layer adapts its own protocol parameters and exchanges\ninformation (messages) with other layers in order to cooperatively maximize the\nperformance of the wireless user. The message exchange mechanism for\ndetermining the optimal cross-layer transmission strategies has been designed\nfor both off-line optimization and on-line dynamic adaptation.

This is the case of disordered systems which\npresent quantum interferences in the diffusive regime, i.e. Anderson\nlocalization effects.

Using a semiclassical description for\nthe atom and field dynamics, we derive a closed system of differential\nequations to describe this coupled atom-field dynamics. For sufficiently strong\npumping the system starts lasing when the atom gets close to a field antinode,\nand the associated light forces provide for self-trapping of the atom. For a\ncavity mode blue detuned with respect to the atomic transition frequency this\nis combined with cavity induced motional cooling allowing for long term\nsteady-state operation of such a laser. The analytical results for temperature\nand field statistics agree well with our earlier predictions based on Quantum\nMonte Carlo simulations. We find sub-Doppler temperatures that decrease with\ngain and coupling strength and can even go beyond the limit of passive cavity\ncooling. Besides demonstrating the importance of light forces in single-atom\nlasers, this result also gives strong evidence to enhance laser cooling through\nstimulated emission in resonators.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Within a semiclassical description, we solve the equations for atomic\nmotion and internal dynamics to obtain analytic expressions for the optical\npotential and friction force seen by each atom. When optical gain is maximum at\nfrequencies where the light field extracts kinetic energy from the atomic\nmotion, the dynamics combines optical lasing and motional cooling. From the\ncorresponding momentum diffusion coefficient we predict sub-Doppler\ntemperatures in the stationary state. This generalizes the theory of cavity\nenhanced laser cooling to active cavity systems. We identify the gain induced\nreduction of the effective resonator linewidth as key origin for the faster\ncooling and lower temperatures, which implys that a bad cavity with a gain\nmedium can replace a high-Q cavity. In addition, this shows the importance of\nlight forces for gas lasers in the low-temperature limit, where atoms can\narrange in a periodic pattern maximizing gain and counteracting spatial hole\nburning. Ultimately, in the low temperature limit, such a setup should allow to\ncombine optical lasing and atom lasing in single device.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]
