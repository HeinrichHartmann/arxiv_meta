Moreover, additional\nseismic fluctuations in the low frequency band can raise this equivalent\ntemperature significantly to 10^5 K. Recently, various methods using\nopto-mechanical forces have been reported to decrease this thermal energy for\nMHz, micro-cantilever oscillators, effectively cooling them.
