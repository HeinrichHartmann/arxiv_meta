Analyses of gene expression or sequence data, which\nhave been indispensable for investigating aging, have been limited to studying\ngenes and their protein products in isolation, ignoring their connectivities.\nHowever, proteins function by interacting with other proteins, and this is\nexactly what biological networks (BNs) model. Thus, analyzing the proteins' BN\ntopologies could contribute to understanding of aging. Current methods for\nanalyzing systems-level BNs deal with their static representations, even though\ncells are dynamic. For this reason, and because different data types can give\ncomplementary biological insights, we integrate current static BNs with\naging-related gene expression data to construct dynamic, age-specific BNs.\nThen, we apply sensitive measures of topology to the dynamic BNs to study\ncellular changes with age.\n  Results: While global BN topologies do not significantly change with age,\nlocal topologies of a number of genes do. We predict such genes as\naging-related. We demonstrate credibility of our predictions by: 1) observing\nsignificant overlap between our predicted aging-related genes and \"ground\ntruth\" aging-related genes; 2) showing that our aging-related predictions group\nby functions and diseases that are different than functions and diseases of\ngenes that are not predicted as aging-related; 3) observing significant overlap\nbetween functions and diseases that are enriched in our aging-related\npredictions and those that are enriched in \"ground truth\" aging-related data;\n4) providing evidence that diseases which are enriched in our aging-related\npredictions are linked to human aging; and 5) validating all of our\nhigh-scoring novel predictions via manual literature search.\n"]}]

This\npaper highlights a number of original results obtained by a detailed\nbioinformatics analysis of the protein. Large scale sequence analysis indicated\nthe presence of an extended transit peptide sequence of PfHsp70-x which\npotentially directs it to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

The basic\nconjecture underlying the Bogolyubov approach is the functional hypothesis,\naccording to which, the many-particle distribution functions are assumed to be\nfunctionals of the one-particle distribution function on kinetic time scales.\nAnother ingredient in the Bogolyubov approach is the principle of the spatial\nweakening of correlations, which reflects statistical independence of physical\nvalues at distant spatial points. One can consider it as a reasonable mixing\nproperty of many-particle distribution functions. The motivation behind the\ngeneralization of Bogolyubov's approach to (classical) many-body dissipative\nsystems is the wish to describe the dynamics of granular systems, in particular\ngranular fluids. To this end we first define a general dissipative fluid\nthrough a dissipation function, thereby generalizing the commonly employed\nmodels for granular fluids. Using the Bogolyubov functional hypothesis we show\nhow a reduction of the pertinent BBGKY hierarchy can be achieved. The method is\nthen employed to cases which can be treated perturbatively, such as those in\nwhich the interactions are weak or the dissipation is small or the particle\ndensity is small. Kinetic descriptions are obtained in all of these limiting\ncases. As a test case, we show that the Bogolyubov method begets the now\nstandard inelastic Boltzmann equation for dilute monodisperse collections of\nspheres whose collisions are characterized by a fixed coefficient of normal\nrestitution.
