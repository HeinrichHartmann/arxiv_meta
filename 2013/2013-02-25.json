We show that if such a quark with a mass in\nthe phenomenologically interesting range of 400 GeV--600 GeV decays to a light\nquark and a W-boson, it will produce a signal in a number of channels which can\nbe seen above the background from the three generation Standard Model\nprocesses. In particular, such quarks could be seen in channels where multiple\njets are present with large missing momentum and either a single hard lepton,\nan opposite sign hard lepton pair or a same sign lepton pair.\n  In the same sign dilepton channel there is little background and so an excess\nof such pairs at large invariant mass will indicate the presence of heavy down\ntype quarks. More generally, in our study, the main tool we use to determine\nthe mass of the heavy quark in each of the channels we consider is to use the\nkinematics of the decay of such quarks to resolve the momenta of the unobserved\nneutrinos. We show how this can be carried out, even in cases where the\nkinematics is under-determined by use of the approximation, which holds quite\nwell, that the two heavy quarks are nearly at rest in the center of mass frame.\n  Since it is very likely that at least the lightest heavy quark decays in the\nmode we consider, this means that it should be observed at the LHC. Indeed, it\nis expected that the mass splitting between the quarks is less than $m_W$ so\nthat if the Cabbibo-Kobayshi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element between the fourth\nand lower generations are not too small, both members of the fourth generation\nquark doublet will decay in this way.

The CSIT is\ngiven by an arbitrary deterministic function of the channel state. This\ncharacteristic yields a full control over how much state information is\navailable, from perfect to no information. In literature, capacity derivations\nfor wireless ergodic fading channels, specifically for fading BCs, mostly rely\non the analysis of channels comprising of parallel sub-channels. This technique\nis usually suitable for the cases where perfect state information is available\nat the transmitters. In this paper, new arguments are proposed to directly\nderive (without resorting to the analysis of parallel channels) capacity bounds\nfor the two-user fading BC with both common and private messages based on the\nexisting bounds for the discrete channel. Specifically, a novel approach is\ndeveloped to adapt and evaluate the well-known UV-outer bound for the Gaussian\nfading channel using the entropy power inequality. Our approach indeed sheds\nlight on the role of broadcast auxiliaries in the fading channel. It is shown\nthat the derived outer bound is optimal for the channel with perfect CSIT as\nwell as for some special cases with partial CSIT. Our outer bound is also\ndirectly applicable to the case without CSIT which has been recently considered\nin several papers. Next, the approach is developed to analyze for the fading BC\nwith secrecy. In the case of perfect CSIT, a full characterization of the\nsecrecy capacity region is derived for the channel with common and confidential\nmessages.
