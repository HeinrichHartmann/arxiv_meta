We\nfirst focus on measuring the delay performance of a very popular cloud storage\nservice Amazon S3. We establish that there is significant randomness in service\ntimes for reading and writing small and medium size objects when assigned\ndistinct keys. We further demonstrate that using erasure coding, parallel\nconnections to storage cloud and limited chunking (i.e., dividing the object\ninto a few smaller objects) together pushes the envelope on service time\ndistributions significantly (e.g., 76%, 80%, and 85% reductions in mean, 90th,\nand 99th percentiles for 2 Mbyte files) at the expense of additional storage\n(e.g., 1.75x). However, chunking and erasure coding increase the load and hence\nthe queuing delays while reducing the supportable rate region in number of\nrequests per second per node. Thus, in the second part of our paper we focus on\nanalyzing the delay performance when chunking, FEC, and parallel connections\nare used together. Based on this analysis, we develop load adaptive algorithms\nthat can pick the best code rate on a per request basis by using off-line\ncomputed queue backlog thresholds. The solutions work with homogeneous services\nwith fixed object sizes, chunk sizes, operation type (e.g., read or write) as\nwell as heterogeneous services with mixture of object sizes, chunk sizes, and\noperation types. We also present a simple greedy solution that\nopportunistically uses idle connections and picks the erasure coding rate\naccordingly on the fly. Both backlog and greedy solutions support the full rate\nregion and provide best mean delay performance when compared to the best fixed\ncoding rate policy.

Spectroscopy of absorption lines produced in the interstellar medium\n(ISM) has been proven to be an effective way to measure the central wavelengths\nof these atomic transitions. In this work we analyze 36 Chandra High Energy\nTransmission Grating observations and search for and measure the ISM absorption\nlines along sight lines of 11 low-mass X-ray binaries. We correct the Galactic\nrotation velocity to the rest frame for every observation and then use two\ndifferent methods to merge all the corrected spectra to a co-added spectrum.\nHowever the co-added spectra obtained by these methods exhibit biases, either\nto the observations of high counts or high signal-to-noise ratios of the lines.\nWe make Bayesian analysis to several significantly detected lines to obtain the\nsystematic uncertainty and the bias correction of other lines.

K. Driver and T. Kemp\nconcerning the large-N limit of the Segal--Bargmann transform for the unitary\ngroup U(N). We consider the transform on matrix-valued functions that are\npolynomials in a single variable in U(N). We show that in the large-N limit,\nthe transform maps functions of this type to single-variable polynomial\nfunctions on the complex group GL(N;C). This result was conjectured by Ph.\nBiane and was also proved independently by G. C\\'ebron. The first main\ningredient in our proof of this result is an \"asymptotic product rule\" for the\nLaplacian on U(N), which allows us to compute explicitly the leading-order\nlarge-N behavior of the heat operator on U(N). The second main ingredient in\nthe proof is the phenomenon of \"concentration of traces,\" in which the relevant\nheat kernel measures are concentrating onto sets where the trace of any power\nof the variable is constant.\n","Comment: Revised version; added discussion of the PDE's for the generating\n  functions. 26 pages"]}]

This leads to a continuous 'cyber cycle' of\nattackers scanning networks, developing exploits and attacking systems, with\ndefenders detecting attacks, analyzing exploits and patching systems. This\nreactive nature leaves sensitive systems highly vulnerable to attack due to\nun-patched systems and undetected exploits. Some current research attempts to\naddress this major limitation by introducing systems that implement moving\ntarget defense. However, these ideas are typically based on the intuition that\na moving target defense will make it much harder for attackers to find and scan\nvulnerable systems, and not on theoretical mathematical foundations. The\ncontinuing lack of fundamental science and principles for developing more\nsecure systems has drawn increased interest into establishing a 'science of\ncyber security'. This paper introduces the concept of using cybernetics, an\ninterdisciplinary approach of control theory, systems theory, information\ntheory and game theory applied to regulatory systems, as a foundational\napproach for developing cyber security principles. It explores potential\napplications of cybernetics to cyber security from a defensive perspective,\nwhile suggesting the potential use for offensive applications. Additionally,\nthis paper introduces the fundamental principles for building non-stationary\nsystems, which is a more general solution than moving target defenses. Lastly,\nthe paper discusses related works concerning the limitations of moving target\ndefense and one implementation based on non-stationary principles.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The method consists in the\npower spectral analysis of solar acoustic oscillations on small regions (2 to\n30 degrees) of the solar surface. The power spectrum resembles a set of\ntrumpets nested inside each other and, for a given frequency, it looks like a\nring, hence the technique's name. It provides information on the horizontal\nflow field and thermodynamic structure in the layers immediately below the\nphotosphere. With data regularly provided by MDI (on board SOHO), GONG+ network\nand more recently HMI (on SDO), many important results have been achieved. In\nrecently years, these results include estimations of the meridional circulation\nand its evolution with solar cycle; flows associated with active regions, as\nwell as, flow divergence and vorticity; and thermal structure beneath and\naround active regions. Much progress is expected with data now provided by\nHMI's high spatial resolution observations and high duty cycle.
