Local Kalman filters are implemented on the\n($n_l-$dimensional, where $n_l\\ll n$) sub-systems that are obtained after\nspatially decomposing the large-scale system. The resulting sub-systems\noverlap, which along with an assimilation procedure on the local Kalman\nfilters, preserve an $L$th order Gauss-Markovian structure of the centralized\nerror processes. The information loss due to the $L$th order Gauss-Markovian\napproximation is controllable as it can be characterized by a divergence that\ndecreases as $L\\uparrow$. The order of the approximation, $L$, leads to a lower\nbound on the dimension of the sub-systems, hence, providing a criterion for\nsub-system selection. The assimilation procedure is carried out on the local\nerror covariances with a distributed iterate collapse inversion (DICI)\nalgorithm that we introduce. The DICI algorithm computes the (approximated)\ncentralized Riccati and Lyapunov equations iteratively with only local\ncommunication and low-order computation. We fuse the observations that are\ncommon among the local Kalman filters using bipartite fusion graphs and\nconsensus averaging algorithms. The proposed algorithm achieves full\ndistribution of the Kalman filter that is coherent with the centralized Kalman\nfilter with an $L$th order Gaussian-Markovian structure on the centralized\nerror processes.

Starting from the\nanalytically known traveling wave solution for the homogeneous medium,\ninfinitely extended, spatially periodic variations in kinetic parameters as the\nexcitation threshold, for example, are taken into account perturbatively. Two\ndifferent multiple scale perturbation methods are applied to derive a\ndifferential equation for the position of the front under perturbations. This\nequation allows the computation of a time independent average velocity,\ndepending on the spatial period length and the amplitude of the\nheterogeneities.

These TMRCAs have special\ndemographic implications because mtDNA is transmitted only from mother to\nchild, and NRY from father to son. Therefore, mtDNA reflects female history,\nand NRY, male history. To investigate what caused the two-to-one female-male\nTMRCA ratio in humans, we develop a forward-looking agent-based model (ABM)\nwith overlapping generations and individual life cycles. We implement two main\nmating systems: polygynandry and polygyny with different degrees in between. In\neach mating system, the male population can be either homogeneous or\nheterogeneous. In the latter case, some males are `alphas' and others are\n`betas', which reflects the extent to which they are favored by female mates. A\nheterogeneous male population implies a competition among males with the\npurpose of signaling as alphas. The introduction of a heterogeneous male\npopulation is found to reduce by a factor 2 the probability of finding equal\nfemale and male TMRCAs and shifts the distribution of the TMRCA ratio to higher\nvalues. We find that high male-male competition is necessary to reproduce a\nTMRCA ratio of 2: less than half the males can be alphas and betas can have at\nmost half the fitness of alphas. In addition, in the modes that maximize the\nprobability of having a TMRCA ratio between 1.5 and 2.5, the present generation\nhas 1.4 times as many female as male ancestors. We also tested the effect of\nsex-biased migration and sex-specific death rates and found that these are\nunlikely to explain alone the sex-biased TMRCA ratio observed in humans.

Since IP-access can be used for all types of services,\ninstead of a plethora of dedicated, single-service systems, there is a\nsignificant potential to make spectrum use more efficient. In this paper, the\nfeasibility and potential benefit of replacing the current terrestrial UHF TV\nbroadcasting system with a mobile, cellular data (IP-) network is analyzed. In\nthe cellular network, TV content would be provided as {one} of the services,\nhere referred to as CellTV. In the investigation we consider typical Swedish\nrural and urban environments. We use different models for TV viewing patterns\nand cellular technologies as expected in the year 2020. Results of the\nquantitative analysis indicate that CellTV distribution can be beneficial if\nthe TV consumption trend goes towards more specialized programming, more local\ncontents, and more on-demand requests. Mobile cellular systems, with their\nflexible unicast capabilities, will be an ideal platform to provide these\nservices. However, the results also demonstrate that CellTV is not a\nspectrum-efficient replacement for terrestrial TV broadcasting with current\nviewing patterns (i.e. a moderate number of channels with each a high numbers\nof viewers). In this case, it is doubtful whether the expected spectrum savings\ncan motivate the necessary investments in upgrading cellular sites and\ndeveloping advanced TV receiver required for the success of CellTV\ndistribution.\n","Comment: To appear on Trans.

For the low probe-photon\nenergy case, the negative differential transmission is found to come from the\nincrease of the intra-band conductivity due to the large variation of electron\ndistribution after the pumping. As for the high probe-photon energy case, the\nnegative differential transmission is shown to tend to appear with the\nhot-electron temperature being closer to the equilibrium one and the chemical\npotential higher than the equilibrium one but considerably smaller than half of\nthe probe-photon energy. We also show that this negative differential\ntransmission can come from both the inter- and the intra-band components of the\nconductivity.

The experimental results show how the turbulence evolves from\nalmost isotropic 3D turbulence ($\\Omega\\lesssim 0.2$ rad/s) to quasi-2D\nturbulence ($\\Omega\\approx 5.0$ rad/s) and how this is reflected by several\nstatistical quantities. In particular, we have studied the orientation of the\nvorticity vector with respect to the three eigenvectors of the local strain\nrate tensor and with respect to the vortex stretching vector. Additionally, we\nhave quantified the role of system rotation on the self-amplification terms of\nthe enstrophy and strain rate equations and the direct contribution of the\nbackground rotation on these evolution equations. The main effect is the strong\nreduction of extreme events and related (strong) reduction of the skewness of\nPDFs of several quantities such as, for example, the intermediate eigenvalue of\nthe strain rate tensor and the enstrophy self-amplification term.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables"]}]

As shown\nin the applications, these results may be applied to the study of periodic\ntime-dependent quantum systems, classical dynamical systems and spectral\nproblems related to the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle.\n"]}]

These mineralizations were\nobserved during a systematic rock-sampling undertaken to complete the\ngeological survey for the new 1:50 000 map of this volcanic area. The examined\nspecimens were collected inside distal deposits correlated to the last Albano\nMaar activity, which are geographically located within the boundaries of the\nNemi community. Tremolite occurs within both carbonate ejecta and the host\npyroclastic rocks. It shows up as whitish to light gray coloured aggregates of\ncrystals with fibrous aspect and sericeous brightness. Due to the extremely\nsmall crystal dimensions, never exceeding 0.5 micron in diameter, the\nmicro-chemical composition of the fibres could be obtained only by combining\nP-XRD, SEM-EDX and FTIR methods. Infrared spectroscopy, in particular, proved\nto be a valuable technique to characterize the studied amphibole. The\ncomposition determined is that of a Fe-free F-rich (c. 53%) tremolite with\nsignificant (c. 20%) richterite components in solid-solution. The occurrence of\nfibrous tremolite in an inhabited place, occurring as natural geological\nmaterial rather than being due to anthropogenic pollution, should be examined\nwith concern, because it implies complex health and legal responsibilities in\nthe case of mobilization due to extreme climatic events.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 5 figures. accepted Rend.
