Tight observational limits on their\nabundance constrain the amplitude of the primordial fluctuations on very small\nscales which can not otherwise be constrained, with PBH's only forming from the\nextremely rare large fluctuations. The number of PBH's formed is therefore\nsensitive to small changes in the shape of the tail of the fluctuation\ndistribution, which itself depends on the amount of non-Gaussianity present. We\nstudy, for the first time, how quadratic and cubic local non-Gaussianity of\narbitrary size (parameterised by f_nl and g_nl respectively) affects the PBH\nabundance and the resulting constraints on the amplitude of the fluctuations on\nvery small scales. Intriguingly we find that even non-linearity parameters of\norder unity have a significant impact on the PBH abundance. The sign of the\nnon-Gaussianity is particularly important, with the constraint on the allowed\nfluctuation amplitude tightening by an order of magnitude as f_nl changes from\njust -0.5 to 0.5. We find that if PBH's are observed in the future, then\nregardless of the amplitude of the fluctuations, non-negligible negative f_nl\nwould be ruled out. Finally we show that g_nl can have an even larger effect on\nthe number of PBH's formed than f_nl.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, v2: version to appear in Phys. Rev.

Historically, the NLSy1s have been distinguished from the\nBLSy1s by the narrow width of the broad Hbeta emission line. The upper limit on\nthe full width at half maximum of this line is 2000 km/s for NLSy1s, while in\nBLSy1s it can be of several thousands of km/s. However, this border has been\narbitrarily set and does not correspond to the change of any physical property.\nAll observed parameters in Type 1 AGN cover continues ranges of values, which\ndoes not allow to infer the existence of two different kind of populations with\nFWHM(Hbeta,broad) = 2000 km/s as dividing point. We argue that the usage of\nthis velocity limit to define samples of NLSy1s galaxies - as it is usually\ndone in comparative studies -, together with the well known observational\nbiases, naturally favors the selection of sources with low black hole masses\nand high Eddington ratios that are hosted by blue spiral galaxies.

Assuming\nexponentially declining star formation rate, we used a set of theoretical\ngalaxy templates obtained from Yunnan EPS models (with and without binary\ninteractions) to present the C-M and C-C relations for passive galaxies via\nMonte Carlo simulation. In Yunnan EPS models with binary interactions, various\nprocesses are included, such as mass transfer, mass accretion, common-envelope\nevolution, collisions, supernova kicks, tidal evolution, and all angular\nmomentum loss mechanisms. In these models, approximately 50 per cent of the\nstellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100\\,yr. This\nfraction is a typical value for the Milky Way.

To accurately describe the carrier scattering process and shed light\non the origin of the thinning-induced mobility degradation, a generalized\nCoulomb scattering model is developed with strictly considering device\nconfigurative conditions, i.e., asymmetric dielectric environments and lopsided\ncarrier distribution. We reveal that the carrier scattering from interfacial\nCoulomb impurities (e.g., chemical residues, gaseous adsorbates and surface\ndangling bonds) is greatly intensified in extremely thinned channels, resulting\nfrom shortened interaction distance between impurities and carriers. Such a\npronounced factor may surpass lattice phonons and serve as dominant scatterers.\nThis understanding offers new insight into the thickness induced scattering\nintensity, highlights the critical role of surface quality in electrical\ntransport and would lead to rational performance improvement strategies for\nfuture atomic electronics.\n","Comment: With Supporting Information"]}]

We report the correlations of published UHECRs,\nrescaling event energies so as to reconcile the spectra of the different\nexperiments and taking the overall energy uncertainty into account; different\ncomposition hypotheses are considered. This work demonstrates the feasibility\nof calculating GMF deflections to low enough rigidities to allow for heavy\ncomposition in correlation studies, and that non-trivial arrival direction\nstructure should be expected even for mixed or heavy composition, as long as\nUHECRs come from the local universe.\n","Comment: Conference proceedings for the ICRC 2013, 4 pages, 7 figures"]}]
