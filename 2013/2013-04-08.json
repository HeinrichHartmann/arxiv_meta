In this paper, we investigate\nusing the bag-of-features strategy to classify the tissue types in medical\nimaging applications. Two important issues are considered here: the visual\nvocabulary learning and weighting. Although there are already plenty of\nalgorithms to deal with them, all of them treat them independently, namely, the\nvocabulary learned first and then the histogram weighted. Inspired by\nAuto-Context who learns the features and classifier jointly, we try to develop\na novel algorithm that learns the vocabulary and weights jointly. The new\nalgorithm, called Joint-ViVo, works in an iterative way. In each iteration, we\nfirst learn the weights for each visual word by maximizing the margin of ROI\ntriplets, and then select the most discriminate visual words based on the\nlearned weights for the next iteration. We test our algorithm on three tissue\nclassification tasks: identifying brain tissue type in magnetic resonance\nimaging (MRI), classifying lung tissue in HRCT images, and classifying breast\ntissue density in mammograms. The results show that Joint-ViVo can perform\neffectively for classifying tissues.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to the terrible\n  writing"]}]

The problem is studied\nanalytically, based on the dipole model, and numerically. Three sources of the\nfield mechanical action - energy density gradient and the orbital and spin\nparts of the energy flow - differ by the ponderomotive mechanism, and their\nphysical nature manifests itself in the optical force dependence on the\nparticle radius a. If a is much less than the radiation wavelength, the optical\nforce behaves as a^n and integer n can be used to classify the sources of the\nmechanical action. This classification correlates with the multipole\nrepresentation of the field-particle interaction: The gradient force and the\norbital-momentum force appear due to the electric or magnetic dipole moments\nper se, the spin-momentum force emerges due to interaction between the electric\nand magnetic dipoles or between the dipole and quadruple moments (if the\nparticle is polarisable electrically but not magnetically or vice versa).

The band structure of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene consists of\na monolayer-like and a bilayer-like pairs of bands. Here we study electronic\nproperties of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene biased by a perpendicular electric\nfield.

The positions and masses of the\nemergent Dirac fermions are tunable by bias, and one group of Dirac fermions\nbecomes massless at a certain bias value. Therefore, in contrast to bilayer\ngraphene, the conductivity at the neutrality point is expected to show\nnon-monotonic behavior, becoming of the order of a few e^2/h when some Dirac\nmasses vanish. Further, we analyze the evolution of Landau level spectrum as a\nfunction of bias. Emergence of new Dirac points in the band structure\ntranslates into new three-fold-degenerate groups of Landau levels. This leads\nto an anomalous quantum Hall effect, in which some quantum Hall steps have a\nheight of 3e^2/h. At an intermediate bias, the degeneracies of all Landau\nlevels get lifted, and in this regime all quantum Hall plateaus are spaced by\ne^2/h.

Every solution corresponds to a different\nmatter configuration. Each family has one solution with special properties,\nwhich can be written in Kerr-like form in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. These\nspecial solutions are of Petrov type D, they are singularity free, but they\nviolate the weak energy condition for a non-vanishing spin and their curvature\ninvariants have different values at $r=0$ depending on the way one approaches\nthe origin. We propose a natural prescription to have rotating solutions with a\nminimal violation of the weak energy condition and without the questionable\nproperty of the curvature invariants at the origin.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures. v2: refereed version"]}]

The advantage of this logical formalism\nis that it offers a declarative representation of statistical knowledge;\nknowledge represented in this manner can be used for a variety of reasoning\ntasks. The logic differs from previous work in probability logics in that it\nuses a probability distribution over the domain of discourse, whereas most\nprevious work (e.g., Nilsson [2], Scott et al. [3], Gaifinan [4], Fagin et al.\n[5]) has investigated the attachment of probabilities to the sentences of the\nlogic (also, see Halpern [6] and Bacchus [7] for further discussion of the\ndifferences). The logic Lp possesses some further important features. First, Lp\nis a superset of first order logic, hence it can represent ordinary logical\nassertions. This means that Lp provides a mechanism for integrating statistical\ninformation and reasoning about uncertainty into systems based solely on logic.\nSecond, Lp possesses transparent semantics, based on sets and probabilities of\nthose sets. Hence, knowledge represented in Lp can be understood in terms of\nthe simple primative concepts of sets and probabilities. And finally, the there\nis a sound proof theory that has wide coverage (the proof theory is complete\nfor certain classes of models). The proof theory captures a sufficient range of\nvalid inferences to subsume most previous probabilistic uncertainty reasoning\nsystems. For example, the linear constraints like those generated by Nilsson's\nprobabilistic entailment [2] can be generated by the proof theory, and the\nBayesian inference underlying belief nets [8] can be performed. In addition,\nthe proof theory integrates quantitative and qualitative reasoning as well as\nstatistical and logical reasoning. In the next section we briefly examine\nprevious work in probability logics, comparing it to Lp. Then we present some\nof the varieties of statistical information that Lp is capable of expressing.\nAfter this we present, briefly, the syntax, semantics, and proof theory of the\nlogic. We conclude with a few examples of knowledge representation and\nreasoning in Lp, pointing out the advantages of the declarative representation\noffered by Lp. We close with a brief discussion of probabilities as degrees of\nbelief, indicating how such probabilities can be generated from statistical\nknowledge encoded in Lp.

For the case of corundum, we find that the 13$\\mu$m\nemission feature - seen in the IR spectra of many AGB stars - can very well be\nassigned to this mineral species. The best fit of the feature is achieved with\noblate corundum grains at mean temperatures around 550 K. Spinel remains a\nviable carrier of the 13$\\mu$m feature as well, but only for T < 300 K and\nnearly spherical grain shapes. Under such circumstances, spinel grains may also\naccount for the 31.8$\\mu$m band that is frequently seen in sources of the\n13$\\mu$m feature and which has not yet been identified with certainty.\n","Comment: Astronomy & Astrophysics, accepted, 26 February 2013.

It has been proposed that the temporal coincidence of a gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) and a type Ib/c supernova (SN) can be explained with the concept of\ninduced gravitational collapse (IGC), induced by the matter ejected from an SN\nIb/c accreting onto a neutron star (NS). The NS is expected to reach the\ncritical mass necessary for it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and emit a GRB.\nWe found a standard luminosity light curve behavior in the late-time X-ray\nemission of this subclass of GRBs. Aims. We test if this standard behavior in\nthe luminosity found in this subclass of GRBs can become a redshift estimator\nof these sources. Methods. We selected a sample of GRBs that belong to this\nsubclass of IGC GRBs associated to an SN (IGC GRB-SN sources). These sources\nhave an isotropic energy $E_{iso} > 10^{52}$ erg and their cosmological\nredshifts are in the range of $z = 0.49-1.261$. We focused on the corresponding\nX-ray luminosity light curves. Results. We find that all GRBs of the sample\nwith measured redshift present a standard luminosity late-time light curve in\nthe $0.3-10$ keV rest-frame energy range. We used these results to estimate the\nGRB redshift of the sample without a measured redshift and found results\nconsistent with other possible redshift indicators. Conclusions. The standard\nlate-time X-ray luminosity light curve of all GRBs of the sample shows a common\nphysical mechanism in this particular phase of the X-ray emission, possibly\nrelated to the creation of the NS from the SN process. This scaling law\nmoreover represents strong evidence of very low or even absent beaming in this\nlate phase of the X-ray afterglow emission process. This could be a fundamental\ntool for estimating the redshift of GRBs that belong to this subclass of\nevents. We are currently expanding this subclass of GRBs to further verify the\nuniversal validity of this new redshift estimation method.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures"]}]

For infinite\nfields the answer is easily seen to positive, so we concentrate on finite\nfields.

This, in turn, yields an algorithm that, given $g$ and the\ninvariant factors of any $A$, returns the elementary divisors of $g(A)$. It is\na rational procedure, as opposed to the classical method that uses the Jordan\ndecomposition of $A$ to find that of $g(A)$.\n  Finally, extending prior results by the authors, we show that for an\nintegrally closed ring $R$ with field of fractions $F$ and companion matrices\n$C,D$ the subalgebra $R< C,D>$ of $M_n(R)$ is a free $R$-module of rank\n$n+(n-m)(n-1)$, where $m$ is the degree of $\\gcd (f,g)\\in F[X]$, and a\npresentation for $R< C,D>$ is given in terms of $C$ and $D$.
