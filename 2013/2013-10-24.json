Real\nworld networks such as the world wide web, however, are not static and\nexperience a considerable amount of turnover, where nodes and edges are both\nadded and deleted. Considering degree-based node removals, we examine the\npossibility of preserving networks from these types of disruptions. We recover\nthe original degree distribution by allowing the network to react to the attack\nby introducing new nodes and attaching their edges via specially tailored\nschemes. We focus particularly on the case of non-uniform failures, a subject\nthat has received little attention in the context of evolving networks.

Due to resonant coupling between direct and\nindirect excitons via electronic tunnelling, dipolaritons possess large dipole\nmoments. Resonant excitation of the cavity mode by a short pulse of light\ninduces oscillations of the indirect exciton density with a characteristic\nfrequency of Rabi flopping. This results in oscillations of classical Hertz\ndipoles array which generate supperradiant emission on a terahertz (THz)\nfrequency. Resulting THz signal may be enhanced using the supplementary THz\ncavity in the weak coupling regime.\n","Comment: 5+10 pages, 3+5 figures; close to printed version, to appear in Phys.\n  Rev.

One traditionally\nwaits for the junk radiation to exit the computational domain before taking\nphysical readings, at the expense of throwing away a segment of the evolution,\nand with the hope that junk radiation exits cleanly. We argue that this hope\ndoes not necessarily pan out as junk radiation could excite long-lived\nconstraint violation. Another complication with the initial data is that it\ncontains orbital eccentricity that needs to be removed, usually by evolving the\nearly part of the inspiral multiple times with gradually improved input\nparameters. We show that this procedure is also adversely impacted by junk\nradiation. In this paper, we do not attempt to eliminate junk radiation\ndirectly, but instead tackle the much simpler problem of ameliorating its\nlong-lasting effects. We report on the success of a method that achieves this\ngoal by combining the removal of junk radiation and eccentricity into a single\n\"joint-elimination\" procedure. This approach has the following benefits: (1) We\ndo not have to contend with the influence of junk radiation on eccentricity\nmeasurements for later iterations of the eccentricity reduction procedure. (2)\nWe re-enforce constraints periodically by invoking the initial data solver,\nremoving the constraint violation excited by junk radiation previously. (3) The\nwasted simulation segment associated with the junk radiation's evolution is\nabsorbed into the eccentricity reduction iterations.

The principal type\nof humor considered, slippage humor, is defined and contrasted with\naggression-based humor. A variety of slippage humor, based on Hofstadter's\nnotion of a frame blend, is presented. Given that a frame is a small coherent\ncluster of concepts pertaining to a single topic (similar to a script), a frame\nblend results when elements extracted from two distinct frames are spliced\ntogether to yield a new hybrid frame. Diverse ways of blending two frames can\nproduce varying degrees and types of humor. Studies of this phenomenon are\npresented. We discuss the connection between frame blends and analogies,\nfocusing on the Copycat domain: an idealized microworld in which analogy making\ncan be studied and modeled on computer. It is shown how jokes can be mapped\ninto that domain, giving rise to a kind of abstract microworld humor. This\nhighlights the relationships amongst good jokes, defective analogies, and frame\nblends. We discuss the notion that many jokes can share the same abstract\nstructure, and propose the term ur-joke for the most abstract level of a joke.\nSeveral specific ur-jokes are presented, each with a set of fully fleshed-out\njokes based on it. We recount efforts at translating two jokes from one subject\nmatter to another in an attempt to determine whether a joke's funniness is due\nmore to its underlying ur-joke or its subject matter. We discuss the\nrelationship between the Raskin's overlapping-script theory of humor,\nHofstadter's frame-blend theory, and a theory that incorporates multiple-level\nanalysis of jokes.

Here we develop a novel\neconomic-market model where transient and long-term market dynamics are\ndetermined by trade friction and agent adaptation, and can influence disease\ntransmission. We specify the participants, frequency, volume, and price in\ntrade transactions, and investigate, using analytical insights and simulation,\nhow trade friction affects joint market and epidemiological dynamics. The\nfriction values explored encompass estimates from French cattle and pig\nmarkets. We show that, when trade is the dominant route of transmission, market\nfriction can be a significantly stronger determinant of epidemics than\nrisk-aversion behaviour. In particular, there is a critical friction level\nabove which epidemics do not occur. For a given level of friction, open\nunregulated markets can boost epidemics compared with closed or tightly\nregulated markets. Our results are robust to model specificities and can hold\nin the presence of non-trade disease-transmission routes. In particular, we try\nto explain why outbreaks in French livestock markets appear more frequently in\ncattle than swine despite swine trade-flow being larger. To minimize contagion\nin markets, safety policies could generate incentives for larger-volume,\nless-frequent transactions, increasing trade friction without necessarily\naffecting overall trade flow.\n","Comment: 51 pages, 9 figures"]}]
