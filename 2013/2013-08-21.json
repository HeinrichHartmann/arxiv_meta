This is addressed by von Neumann's concept of a\nself-replicating automaton (SRA). A SRA consists of a self-assembly code that\nis used in two distinct ways: (1) actively deciphered during development to\nconstruct a self-similar replicant, and (2) passively copied to the replicant\nto ensure that it can reproduce. Information that is acquired over a lifetime\nis not transmitted to offspring, whereas information that is inherited during\ncopying is transmitted. In cultural evolution there is no mechanism for\ndiscarding acquired change. Acquired change can accumulate orders of magnitude\nfaster than, and quickly overwhelm, inherited change due to differential\nreplication of variants in response to selection. This prohibits a selectionist\nbut not an evolutionary framework for culture. Recent work on the origin of\nlife suggests that early life evolved through a non-Darwinian process referred\nto as communal exchange that does not involve a self-assembly code, and that\nnatural selection emerged from this more haphazard, ancestral evolutionary\nprocess. It is proposed that communal exchange provides a more appropriate\nevolutionary framework for culture than selectionism.

The study focuses on globally modulated STDP, as\na special use-case of this method. Flexibility is achieved by embedding a\ngeneral-purpose processor dedicated to plasticity into the wafer. To evaluate\nthe suitability of the proposed system, we use a reward modulated STDP rule in\na spike train learning task. A single layer of neurons is trained to fire at\nspecific points in time with only the reward as feedback. This model is\nsimulated to measure its performance, i.e. the increase in received reward\nafter learning. Using this performance as baseline, we then simulate the model\nwith various constraints imposed by the proposed implementation and compare the\nperformance. The simulated constraints include discretized synaptic weights, a\nrestricted interface between analog synapses and embedded processor, and\nmismatch of analog circuits. We find that probabilistic updates can increase\nthe performance of low-resolution weights, a simple interface between analog\nsynapses and processor is sufficient for learning, and performance is\ninsensitive to mismatch. Further, we consider communication latency between\nwafer and the conventional control computer system that is simulating the\nenvironment. This latency increases the delay, with which the reward is sent to\nthe embedded processor. Because of the time continuous operation of the analog\nsynapses, delay can cause a deviation of the updates as compared to the not\ndelayed situation. We find that for highly accelerated systems latency has to\nbe kept to a minimum.

We also clarify the conditions under which the\nspecific heat matches to the behavior of a Fermi liquid or a Bose liquid. We\ncalculate the current-current and density-density retarded Green's functions,\nfrom which we can obtain the AC conductivity and the zero sound mode. The AC\nconductivity scales as $\\omega^{-1}$ when $d/\\eta<2$ and $\\omega^{-2\\eta/d}$\nwhen $d/\\eta>2$, while it contains a logarithmic term in $\\omega$ when\n$d/\\eta=2$.

The spatial variation of chromatin density within\nmouse olfactory sensory neurons is determined from soft X-ray tomography\nreconstructions of five nuclei. We show that there is a division of the nuclear\nspace into regions of low-density euchromatin and high-density heterochromatin.\nVolume exclusion experienced by a diffusing protein caused by this varying\ndensity of chromatin is modeled by a repulsive potential. The value of the\npotential at a given point in space is chosen to be proportional to the density\nof chromatin at that location. The constant of proportionality, called the\nvolume exclusivity, provides a model parameter that determines the strength of\nvolume exclusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the mean time for a\nprotein to locate a binding site localized in euchromatin is minimized for a\nfinite, non-zero volume exclusivity. For binding sites in heterochromatin, the\nmean time is minimized when the volume exclusivity is zero (the protein\nexperiences no volume exclusion). An analytical theory is developed to explain\nthese results. The theory suggests that for binding sites in euchromatin there\nis an optimal level of volume exclusivity that balances a reduction in the\nvolume searched in finding the binding site, with the height of effective\npotential barriers the protein must cross during the search process.\n","Comment: 22 Pages, 7 Figures, Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, 2013.

Our approach includes an interface to justification graphs, which treat\nwhy-not and defeasibility as well as provenance of the rules supporting\nanswers. It also includes tools for trace-based analysis of computations to\npermit understanding of erroneous non-termination and of general performance\nissues. For semantically correct cases of the non-terminating behavior, Silk\noffers a different approach, which addresses the problem in a formally sound\nmanner by leveraging a form of bounded rationality called restraint.\n","Comment: Part of WLPE 2013 proceedings (arXiv:1308.2055)"]}]

We\nassert that the notion of `levels of structure', the coupling strength between\nconstituents in different levels, and the use of collective variables in each\nlevel are all pertinent factors. We consider two types of coupling, each\nconstituent particle is coupled to only one other particle (1-to-1) versus it\ncoupled to all particles (1-to-all). In the 1-1 case with pairwise interactions\nof equal strength, the entanglement is independent of the number of constituent\nparticles $N$ in the macroscopic object. In the 1-to-all case the relative\ncoordinates are decoupled and the center of mass (CoM) coupling scales with\n$N$. We provide a proof of the conditions whereby the CoM variable decouples, a\ncause for the special role the CoM variable plays in the entanglement between\nthe two such macroscopic objects. This qualitative behavior is largely not\naffected by fluctuations in the interaction strength.

The difference between our method and conventional ones is in\nthe signal spaces. Conventional designs are executed in the discrete-time\ndomain, while our design takes account of both the discrete-time and the\ncontinuous-time signals. Namely, our method can take account of the\ncharacteristic of the original analog signal and the influence of the A/D and\nD/A conversion. While the conventional method often indicates that an ideal\ndigital low-pass filter is preferred, we show that the optimal solution need\nnot be an ideal low-pass when the original analog signal is not completely\nband-limited. This fact can not be recognized only in the discrete-time domain.\nMoreover, we consider quantization effects. We discuss the stability and the\nperformance of quantized sampled-data control systems. We justify H-infinity\ncontrol to reduce distortion caused by the quantizer. Then we apply it to\ndifferential pulse code modulation.

Measurements of isotopic ratios\nin cometary materials provide strong constraints on the content of the\nprotosolar nebula. Their relation with the composition of the parental dark\nclouds is, however, still very elusive. In this paper, we bring new constraints\nbased on the isotopic composition of nitrogen in dark clouds, with the aim of\nunderstanding the chemical processes that are responsible for the observed\nisotopic ratios. We have observed and detected the fundamental rotational\ntransition of C$^{15}$N towards two starless dark clouds, L1544 and L1498. We\nwere able to derive the column density ratio of C$^{15}$N over $^{13}$CN\ntowards the same clouds, and obtain the CN/C$^{15}$N isotopic ratios, which\nwere found to be $500\\pm75$ for both L1544 and L1498. These values are\ntherefore marginally consistent with the protosolar value of 441. Moreover,\nthis ratio is larger than the isotopic ratio of nitrogen measured in HCN. In\naddition, we present model calculations of the chemical fractionation of\nnitrogen in dark clouds, which make it possible to understand how CN can be\ndeprived of $^{15}$N and HCN can simultaneously be enriched in heavy nitrogen.\nThe non-fractionation of N2H+, however, remains an open issue and we propose\nsome chemical way of alleviating the discrepancy between model predictions and\nthe observed ratios.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Recently, scaling properties were shown to fluctuate\nacross brain networks and to be modulated between rest and task (He, 2011):\nnotably, Hurst exponent, quantifying long memory, decreases under task in\nactivating and deactivating brain regions. In most cases, such results were\nobtained: First, from univariate (voxelwise or regionwise) analysis, hence\nfocusing on specific cognitive systems such as Resting-State Networks (RSNs)\nand raising the issue of the specificity of this scale-free dynamics modulation\nin RSNs. Second, using analysis tools designed to measure a single scaling\nexponent related to the second order statistics of the data, thus relying on\nmodels that either implicitly or explicitly assume Gaussianity and (asymptotic)\nself-similarity, while fMRI signals may significantly depart from those either\nof those two assumptions (Ciuciu et al., 2008; Wink et al., 2008). To address\nthese issues, the present contribution elaborates on the analysis of the\nscaling properties of fMRI temporal dynamics by proposing two significant\nvariations. First, scaling properties are technically investigated using the\nrecently introduced Wavelet Leader-based Multifractal formalism (WLMF; Wendt et\nal., 2007). This measures a collection of scaling exponents, thus enables a\nricher and more versatile description of scale invariance (beyond correlation\nand Gaussianity), referred to as multifractality. Also, it benefits from\nimproved estimation performance compared to tools previously used in the\nliterature. Second, scaling properties are investigated in both RSN and non-RSN\nstructures (e.g., artifacts), at a broader spatial scale than the voxel one,\nusing a multivariate approach, namely the Multi-Subject Dictionary Learning\n(MSDL) algorithm (Varoquaux et al., 2011) that produces a set of spatial\ncomponents that appear more sparse than their Independent Component Analysis\n(ICA) counterpart. These tools are combined and applied to a fMRI dataset\ncomprising 12 subjects with resting-state and activation runs (Sadaghiani et\nal., 2009). Results stemming from those analysis confirm the already reported\ntask-related decrease of long memory in functional networks, but also show that\nit occurs in artifacts, thus making this feature not specific to functional\nnetworks. Further, results indicate that most fMRI signals appear multifractal\nat rest except in non-cortical regions. Task-related modulation of\nmultifractality appears only significant in functional networks and thus can be\nconsidered as the key property disentangling functional networks from\nartifacts. These finding are discussed in the light of the recent literature\nreporting scaling dynamics of EEG microstate sequences at rest and addressing\nnon-stationarity issues in temporally independent fMRI modes.\n"]}]
