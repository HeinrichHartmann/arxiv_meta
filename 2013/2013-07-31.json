It was recently shown that when it comes to designing optimal\ncentralized or partially structured decentralized state-feedback controllers\nwith limited model information, the best control design strategy in terms of\ncompetitive ratio is a static one. This is true even though the optimal\nstructured decentralized state-feedback controller with full model information\nis dynamic. In this paper, we show that, in contrast, the best limited model\ninformation control design strategy for the disturbance accommodation problem\ngives a dynamic controller. We find an explicit minimizer of the competitive\nratio and we show that it is undominated, that is, there is no other control\ndesign strategy that performs better for all possible plants while having the\nsame worst-case ratio. This optimal controller can be separated into a static\nfeedback law and a dynamic disturbance observer. For constant disturbances, it\nis shown that this structure corresponds to proportional-integral control.\n"]}]

It can also\ncontribute significantly to the construction of a discriminant rule for\npredicting the class of origin of an unclassified tissue sample from a patient.\nWe present a novel approach to the problem of detecting DE genes that is based\non a test statistic formed as a weighted (normalized) cluster-specific contrast\nin the mixed effects of the mixture model used in the first instance to cluster\nthe gene profiles into a manageable number of clusters. The key factor in the\nformation of our test statistic is the use of gene-specific mixed effects in\nthe cluster-specific contrast.

This semiclassical approach bridges the\ngap between the drift-diffusion and ballistic (\"thermionic\") models of carrier\ntransport, whose validity is limited to the range of very small and very large\nvalues, respectively, of the carrier mean free path. The physical concept\nunderlying the thermoballistic approach, while incorporating basic features of\nthe drift-diffusion and ballistic descriptions, constitutes a novel, unifying\nscheme. It is based on the introduction of \"ballistic configurations\" defined\nby a random partitioning of the length of a semiconducting sample into\nballistic transport intervals, which are linked by points of local\nthermodynamic equilibrium at which carriers are emitted or absorbed. By\naveraging the carrier currents in the ballistic intervals over all ballistic\nconfigurations, a position-dependent thermoballistic current is derived for\narbitrary magnitude of the carrier mean free path. This current is the key\nelement of the thermoballistic concept and forms the point of departure of the\ncalculation of various transport quantities. The present article starts out\nwith an account of the standard drift-diffusion and ballistic transport models,\nand of a prototype model which paves the way for the fully developed form of\nthat concept. In the main body of the article, a coherent exposition of the\nthermoballistic approach is given within a general formulation that takes into\naccount arbitrarily shaped, spin-split potential energy profiles and spin\nrelaxation during the carrier motion across ballistic intervals.

The emergence of third generation sequencing (Pacific\nBiosciences) with long reads enables the opportunity to resolve complicated\nrepeats that could not be resolved by the short read data. However, these long\nreads have high error rate and it is an uphill task to assemble the genome\nwithout using additional high quality short reads. Recently, Koren et al. 2012\nproposed an approach to use high quality short reads data to correct these long\nreads and, thus, make the assembly from long reads possible. However, due to\nthe large size of both dataset (short and long reads), error-correction of\nthese long reads requires excessively high computational resources, even on\nsmall bacterial genomes. In this work, instead of error correction of long\nreads, we first assemble the short reads and later map these long reads on the\nassembly graph to resolve repeats.\n  Contribution: We present a hybrid assembly approach that is both\ncomputationally effective and produces high quality assemblies. Our algorithm\nfirst operates with a simplified version of the assembly graph consisting only\nof long contigs and gradually improves the assembly by adding smaller contigs\nin each iteration.

Following the\nmulti-line detections of O2 with low abundances in the Orion and rho Oph A\nmolecular clouds with Herschel, it is important to investigate other\nenvironments, and we here quantify the O2 abundance near a solar-mass\nprotostar. Observations of O2, at 487 GHz toward a deeply embedded low-mass\nClass 0 protostar, NGC 1333-IRAS 4A, are presented, using the HIFI instrument\non the Herschel Space Observatory.

The high spectral resolution data are\nanalysed using radiative transfer models to infer column densities and\nabundances, and are tested directly against full gas-grain chemical models. The\ndeep HIFI spectrum fails to show O2 at the velocity of the dense protostellar\nenvelope, implying one of the lowest abundance upper limits of O2/H2 at\n<6x10^-9 (3 sigma).

For the protostellar envelope, pure gas-phase models\nand gas-grain chemical models require a long pre-collapse phase (~0.7-1x10^6\nyears), during which atomic and molecular oxygen are frozen out onto dust\ngrains and fully converted to H2O, to avoid overproduction of O2 in the dense\nenvelope. The same model also reproduces the limits on the chemically related\nNO molecule. The tentative detection of O2 in the surrounding cloud is\nconsistent with a low-density PDR model with small changes in reaction rates.\nThe low O2 abundance in the collapsing envelope around a low-mass protostar\nsuggests that the gas and ice entering protoplanetary disks is very poor in O2.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures, accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

Proposed methods are mainly\nbased on the use of graphical Gaussian models for observational wild-type data\nand provide undirected graphs that are not able to accurately highlight the\ncausal relationships among genes. In the present work, we seek to improve\nestimation of causal effects among genes by jointly modeling observational\ntranscriptomic data with intervention data obtained by performing knock-outs or\nknock-downs on a subset of genes. By examining the impact of such expression\nperturbations on other genes, a more accurate reflection of regulatory\nrelationships may be obtained than through the use of wild-type data alone.\nResults: Using the framework of Gaussian Bayesian networks, we propose a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithm with a Mallows model and an analytical likelihood\nmaximization to sample from the posterior distribution of causal node\norderings, and in turn, to estimate causal effects. The main advantage of the\nproposed algorithm over previously proposed methods is that it has the\nflexibility to accommodate any kind of intervention design, including partial\nor multiple knock-out experiments. Methods were compared on simulated data as\nwell as data from the DREAM 2007 challenge. Conclusions: The simulation study\nconfirmed the impossibility of estimating causal orderings of genes with\nobservation data only. The proposed algorithm was found, in most cases, to\nperform better than the previously proposed methods in terms of accuracy for\nthe estimation of causal effects. In addition, multiple knock-outs proved to\nbring valuable additional information compared to single knock-outs. The choice\nof optimal intervention design therefore appears to be a crucial aspect for\ncausal inference and an interesting challenge for future research.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

We develop differential geometry on manifolds in which a basic set\nof coordinates (`fields') have two superpartners (`antifields'). The\nquantization on such a triplectic manifold requires introducing several\nspecific differential-geometric objects, whose properties we study. These\nobjects are then used to impose a set of generalized master-equations that\nensure gauge-independence of the path integral. The theory thus quantized is\nshown to extend to a level-1 theory formulated on a manifold that includes\nantifields to the Lagrange multipliers. We also observe intriguing relations\nbetween triplectic and ordinary symplectic geometry.\n","Comment: Revised version -- our treatment in Section 5 has been extended and\n  several pedagogical notes inserted in Sections 2--4; more references added."]}]
