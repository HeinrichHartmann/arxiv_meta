We illustrate this by\nperforming the anatomy of flavour violation in the 331 models, based on the\ngauge group SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X that are among the simplest NP scenarios\nwith new sources of flavour and CP violation. The latter originate dominantly\nthrough the flavour violating interactions of ordinary quarks and leptons with\na new heavy Z' gauge boson. After discussing first these models in some\ngenerality, we present a detailed study of Delta F=2 observables and of rare K\nand B meson decays in the specific beta=1/\\sqrt{3} model (to be called\noverline{331} model) assuming significantly smaller uncertainties in CKM and\nhadronic parameters than presently available. The most prominent roles in our\nanalysis play epsilon_K, Delta M_q (q=d,s), the mixing induced CP asymmetries\nS_{psi K_S} and S_{psi phi}, rare decays B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- and in particular\nthe CP-asymmetry S_{mu^+ mu^-}^s in B_s ->mu^+ mu^-. We identify a number of\ncorrelations between various observables that differ from those known from CMFV\nmodels. While, the Delta F=2 observables allow still for four oases in the new\nparameter space, we demonstrate how the inclusion of Delta F=1 observables can\nin the future identify the optimal oasis for this model. For 1 TeV <= M_{Z'}<=\n3 TeV the overline{331} model is in good agreement with the recent data for\nB^+->tau^+ nu_tau, it removes the epsilon_K-S_{psi K_S} tension present in the\nSM and the epsilon_K-Delta M_{s,d} tension present in CMFV models.\nSimultaneously, while differing from the SM, it is consistent with the present\ndata on BR(B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^-) and S_{psi phi}.

For wavelengths > 170 nm, the wavelength dependence of\nln(cross-section_CO2(wavelength, T)x1/Qv(T)) can be parametrized with a linear\nlaw. Thus, we can interpolate cross-section_CO2(wavelength, T) at any\ntemperature between 300 and 800 K. Within the studied range of temperature, the\nCO2 cross section can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in\nparticular, makes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high\nas 230 nm. The absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to\ntemperature. The model predicts that accounting for this temperature dependency\nof CO2 cross section can affect the computed abundances of NH3, CO2, and CO by\none order of magnitude in the atmospheres of hot Jupiter and hot Neptune.

These changes\ncan even lead to a reversal of the usual Poynting effect. Therefore the usual\npractice of arbitrarily choosing a value of Poisson's ratio when numerically\nmodelling rubbers and soft tissue will, almost certainly, lead to a significant\ndifference between the simulated and actual normal stresses in a sheared block\nbecause of the difference between the assumed and actual value of Poisson's\nratio. The worrying conclusion is that simulations based on arbitrarily\nspecifying Poisson's ratio close to 1/2 cannot accurately predict the normal\nstress distribution even for the simplest of shearing deformations.

In this context, we present a (classical)\nmolecular density functional theory (MDFT) of water that is derived from first\nprinciples and is based on two classical density fields, a scalar one, the\nparticle density, and a vectorial one, the multipolar polarization density. Its\nimplementation requires as input the partial charge distribution of a water\nmolecule and three measurable bulk properties, namely the structure factor and\nthe k-dependent longitudinal and transverse dielectric constants. It has to be\ncomplemented by a solute-solvent three-body term that reinforces tetrahedral\norder at short range. The approach is shown to provide the correct\nthree-dimensional microscopic solvation profile around various molecular\nsolutes, possibly possessing H-bonding sites, at a computer cost two-three\norders of magnitude lower than with explicit simulations.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures"]}]
