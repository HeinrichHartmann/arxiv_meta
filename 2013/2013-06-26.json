In particular, the relation to the Schwinger method of an effective\naction is established. As an example, we calculate neutral fermion creation\nfrom the vacuum by a linearly growing magnetic field. We show that the total\nnumber and the vacuum-to-vacuum transition probability of created pairs depend\nonly on the gradient of the magnetic field, but not on its strength, and this\nfact does not depend on the spacetime dimension. We show that the created flux\naimed in one of the directions is formed from fluxes of particles and\nantiparticles of equal intensity and with the same magnetic moments parallel to\nthe external field. In such a flux, particle and antiparticle velocities that\nare perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic moment and flux direction are\nessentially depressed. The creation of neutral fermions with anomalous magnetic\nmoments leads to a smoothing of the initial magnetic field, which in turn\nprevents appearance of superstrong constant magnetic fields. Our estimations\nshow that the vacuum instability with respect to the creation of neutrinos and\neven neutrons in strong magnetic fields of the magnetars and fields generated\nduring a supernova explosion has to be taken into account in the astrophysics.\nIn particular, it may be of significance for dark matter studies.\n","Comment: 20 pages, discussion of dark matter and 5 refs. added, misprints\n  corrected, version published by Phys.

This interaction relies on strong coupling\nbetween the qubits' transition dipole moments and the vacuum fluctuations of\nthe resonator in the same manner as cavity QED, and has consequently come to be\ncalled \"circuit QED\" (cQED). Great strides in the control of quantum\ninformation have already been made experimentally using this idea.

The main objectives of Part 1 are to\npostulate a new principle of representation invariance (PRI), and to refine the\nunified field model of four interactions, derived using the principle of\ninteraction dynamics (PID). Intuitively, PID takes the variation of the action\nfunctional under energy-momentum conservation constraint, and PRI requires that\nphysical laws be independent of representations of the gauge groups. One\nimportant outcome of this field model is a natural duality between the\ninteracting fields and the adjoint bosonic fields. This duality predicts two\nHiggs particles of similar mass with one due to weak interaction and the other\ndue to strong interaction. The field model can be naturally decoupled to study\nindividual interactions, leading to 1) modified Einstein equations, giving rise\nto a unified theory for dark matter and dark energy, 2) three levels of strong\ninteraction potentials for quark, nucleon/hadron, and atom respectively, and 3)\ntwo weak interaction potentials. These potential/force formulas offer a clear\nmechanism for both quark confinement and asymptotic freedom. The main\nobjectives of Part 2 are 1) to propose a sub-leptons and sub-quark model, which\nwe call weakton model, and 2) to derive a mechanism for all sub-atomic decays\nand bremsstrahlung. The weakton model postulates that all matter particles and\nmediators are made up of massless weaktons. The weakton model offers a perfect\nexplanation for all sub-atomic decays and all generation/annihilation precesses\nof matter-antimatter. In particular, the precise constituents of particles\ninvolved in all decays both before and after the reaction can now be precisely\nderived. In addition, the bremsstrahlung phenomena can be understood using the\nweakton model. Also, the weakton model offers an explanation to the baryon\nasymmetry problem.\n","Comment: expanded version with minor typos corrected as well"]}]

The statistical (frequentist) hypothesis testing framework, does\nnot scale with the number of hypotheses in the sense that naively performing\nmany hypothesis tests will probably yield many false findings. Indeed,\nstatistical \"significance\" is evidence for the presence of a signal within the\nnoise expected in a single test, not in a multitude. In order to protect\nhimself from an uncontrolled number of erroneous findings, a researcher has to\nconsider of the type or errors he wishes to avoid and select the adequate\nprocedure for that particular error type and data structure. A quick search of\nthe tag [multiple-comparisons] in the statistics Questions & Answers web site\nCross Validates (http://stats.stackexchange.com) demonstrates the amount of\nconfusion this task can actually cause.

We show\nthat the massive vector fields of indefinite spin are consistent with Poincare\nsymmetry and have physically desirable properties that are absent for their\npure spin-one counterpart. Using the new vector fields, the decay of the\nW^{\\pm} and Z bosons to leptons at tree-level are in agreement with the\nStandard Model (SM) predictions. For higher order scattering amplitudes, the\ntheory has better convergent behaviour than the intermediate vector boson model\nand the Fermi theory. Elko has the unusual property that it satisfies the\nKlein-Gordon but not the Dirac equation and has mass dimension one instead of\nthree-half. We show that the Elko fields are local only along a preferred axis\nand that they violate Lorentz symmetry. Motivated by the results obtained by\nAhluwalia and Horvath that the Elko spin-sums are covariant under very special\nrelativity (VSR) transformations, we derive the VSR particle states and quantum\nfields. We show that the VSR particles can only interact with the SM particles\nthrough gravity and massive scalar particles thus making them and hence Elko\ndark matter candidates.\n","Comment: Ph.D. thesis.

While dimensional\nregularization yields a result which respects the electromagnetic Ward\nidentities, additional terms which violate gauge invariance arise if the\ncalculation is done setting $d=4$. This discrepancy between the $d=4-\\epsilon$\nand $d=4$ results is recognized as a true ambiguity which must be resolved\nusing physics input; as dimensional regularization respects gauge invariance,\nthe $d=4-\\epsilon$ calculation is accepted as the correct SM result. However,\nhere we point out another possibility; working in analogy with the gauge chiral\nanomaly, we note that it is possible that the individual diagrams do violate\nthe electromagnetic Ward identities, but that the gauge-invariance-violating\nterms cancel when all contributions to $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$, both from\nthe SM and from new physics, are included. We thus examine the consequences of\nthe hypothesis that the $d=4$ calculation is valid, but that such a\ncancellation occurs.

We point out that the\ngauge-invariance-violating terms in $d=4$ arise not just for the diagram\ncontaining a SM $W^{\\pm}$ boson, but also for general fermion and scalar loops,\nand relate these terms to a lack of shift invariance in Higgs tadpole diagrams.\nWe then derive the analogue of \"anomaly cancellation conditions\", and find\nconsequences for solutions to the hierarchy problem.

Inertial mass\nand gravitational mass are not merely equal, they are the identical thing\nviewed from two complementary perspectives (Annalen der Physik, 14 (8), 479,\n2005). In the first case an object accelerating through the electromagnetic\nzero-point field experiences resistance from the field. In the case of an\nobject held fixed in a gravitational field, the electromagnetic zero-point\nfield propagates on curved geodesics, in effect accelerating with respect to\nthe fixed object, thereby generating weight. Hence, the equivalence principle\ndoes not need to be independently postulated.\n"]}]

The asymptotic part of the\nspin dependent amplitude is found to be well represented by pi-0-exchange in\nthe t-channel. A backward spin-polarizability of\ngamma(pi)=(-37.1+-0.6(stat+syst)+-3.0(model))x10^{-4}fm^4 has been determined\nfrom data of the first resonance region below 455 MeV. This value is in a good\nagreement with predictions of dispersion relations and chiral pertubation\ntheory. From a subset of data between 280 and 360 MeV the resonance\npion-photoproduction amplitudes were evaluated leading to a E2/M1 multipole\nratio of the p-to-Delta radiative transition of EMR(340\nMeV)=(-1.7+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))%. It was found that this number is\ndependent on the parameterization of photo-meson amplitudes. With the MAID2K\nparameterization an E2/M1 multipole ratio of EMR(340\nMeV)=(-2.0+-0.4(stat+syst)+-0.2(model))% is obtained.\n"]}]
