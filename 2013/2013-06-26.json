In particular, the relation to the Schwinger method of an effective\naction is established. As an example, we calculate neutral fermion creation\nfrom the vacuum by a linearly growing magnetic field. We show that the total\nnumber and the vacuum-to-vacuum transition probability of created pairs depend\nonly on the gradient of the magnetic field, but not on its strength, and this\nfact does not depend on the spacetime dimension. We show that the created flux\naimed in one of the directions is formed from fluxes of particles and\nantiparticles of equal intensity and with the same magnetic moments parallel to\nthe external field. In such a flux, particle and antiparticle velocities that\nare perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic moment and flux direction are\nessentially depressed. The creation of neutral fermions with anomalous magnetic\nmoments leads to a smoothing of the initial magnetic field, which in turn\nprevents appearance of superstrong constant magnetic fields. Our estimations\nshow that the vacuum instability with respect to the creation of neutrinos and\neven neutrons in strong magnetic fields of the magnetars and fields generated\nduring a supernova explosion has to be taken into account in the astrophysics.\nIn particular, it may be of significance for dark matter studies.\n","Comment: 20 pages, discussion of dark matter and 5 refs. added, misprints\n  corrected, version published by Phys.

This interaction relies on strong coupling\nbetween the qubits' transition dipole moments and the vacuum fluctuations of\nthe resonator in the same manner as cavity QED, and has consequently come to be\ncalled \"circuit QED\" (cQED). Great strides in the control of quantum\ninformation have already been made experimentally using this idea.

The main objectives of Part 1 are to\npostulate a new principle of representation invariance (PRI), and to refine the\nunified field model of four interactions, derived using the principle of\ninteraction dynamics (PID). Intuitively, PID takes the variation of the action\nfunctional under energy-momentum conservation constraint, and PRI requires that\nphysical laws be independent of representations of the gauge groups. One\nimportant outcome of this field model is a natural duality between the\ninteracting fields and the adjoint bosonic fields. This duality predicts two\nHiggs particles of similar mass with one due to weak interaction and the other\ndue to strong interaction. The field model can be naturally decoupled to study\nindividual interactions, leading to 1) modified Einstein equations, giving rise\nto a unified theory for dark matter and dark energy, 2) three levels of strong\ninteraction potentials for quark, nucleon/hadron, and atom respectively, and 3)\ntwo weak interaction potentials. These potential/force formulas offer a clear\nmechanism for both quark confinement and asymptotic freedom. The main\nobjectives of Part 2 are 1) to propose a sub-leptons and sub-quark model, which\nwe call weakton model, and 2) to derive a mechanism for all sub-atomic decays\nand bremsstrahlung. The weakton model postulates that all matter particles and\nmediators are made up of massless weaktons. The weakton model offers a perfect\nexplanation for all sub-atomic decays and all generation/annihilation precesses\nof matter-antimatter. In particular, the precise constituents of particles\ninvolved in all decays both before and after the reaction can now be precisely\nderived. In addition, the bremsstrahlung phenomena can be understood using the\nweakton model. Also, the weakton model offers an explanation to the baryon\nasymmetry problem.\n","Comment: expanded version with minor typos corrected as well"]}]

Furthermore, these studies find other families\nof initial data which similarly avoid the instability for sufficiently weak\nparameters. Heuristically, we argue that initial data families with widely\ndistributed mass-energy distort the spacetime sufficiently to oppose the\ncoherent amplification favored by the instability. From the dual CFT\nperspective our findings suggest that there exist families of rather generic\ninitial conditions in strongly coupled CFT (with large number of degrees of\nfreedom) that do not thermalize in the infinite future.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 12 figures; Updated with a few more references and typos\n  fixed"]}]

The statistical (frequentist) hypothesis testing framework, does\nnot scale with the number of hypotheses in the sense that naively performing\nmany hypothesis tests will probably yield many false findings. Indeed,\nstatistical \"significance\" is evidence for the presence of a signal within the\nnoise expected in a single test, not in a multitude. In order to protect\nhimself from an uncontrolled number of erroneous findings, a researcher has to\nconsider of the type or errors he wishes to avoid and select the adequate\nprocedure for that particular error type and data structure. A quick search of\nthe tag [multiple-comparisons] in the statistics Questions & Answers web site\nCross Validates (http://stats.stackexchange.com) demonstrates the amount of\nconfusion this task can actually cause.

To be\nmore precise, it is seen that the set of coding rates achieved by linear\nencoder over certain non-field rings is strictly larger than the one achieved\nby the field version, regardless which finite field is considered.

While dimensional\nregularization yields a result which respects the electromagnetic Ward\nidentities, additional terms which violate gauge invariance arise if the\ncalculation is done setting $d=4$. This discrepancy between the $d=4-\\epsilon$\nand $d=4$ results is recognized as a true ambiguity which must be resolved\nusing physics input; as dimensional regularization respects gauge invariance,\nthe $d=4-\\epsilon$ calculation is accepted as the correct SM result. However,\nhere we point out another possibility; working in analogy with the gauge chiral\nanomaly, we note that it is possible that the individual diagrams do violate\nthe electromagnetic Ward identities, but that the gauge-invariance-violating\nterms cancel when all contributions to $H\\rightarrow\\gamma\\gamma$, both from\nthe SM and from new physics, are included. We thus examine the consequences of\nthe hypothesis that the $d=4$ calculation is valid, but that such a\ncancellation occurs. We work in general renormalizable gauge, thus avoiding\nissues with momentum routing ambiguities. We point out that the\ngauge-invariance-violating terms in $d=4$ arise not just for the diagram\ncontaining a SM $W^{\\pm}$ boson, but also for general fermion and scalar loops,\nand relate these terms to a lack of shift invariance in Higgs tadpole diagrams.\nWe then derive the analogue of \"anomaly cancellation conditions\", and find\nconsequences for solutions to the hierarchy problem.

For this purpose, two different techniques have been employed. The\nfirst one relies on the measurement of the fragments resulting after\ncollisional activation and subsequent dissociation of mass selected cluster\nions in a molecular beam passing through a cell filled with noble gas atoms.\nThe second one is a new approach that we introduce and is based on crossed\nmolecular beams to measure the fragmentation cross sections, in a more\nefficient manner without mass selection of the individual clusters. The cross\nsections obtained with the different techniques are compared with each other as\nwell as with theoretical ones resulting from the application of a simple\ngeometrical projection model.
