Due to the nonmonotonicity of the slip\nequation the resulting steady-state flow curve is nonmonotonic and unstable\nsteady-states appear in the negative-slope regime. It has been known that\nself-sustained oscillations of the pressure gradient are obtained when an\nunstable steady-state is perturbed [Fyrillas et al., Polymer Eng.

It is shown\nfor the first time how equilibrium solutions lose stability to oscillating ones\nthrough a subcritical Hopf bifurcation point which generates a branch of\nunstable limit cycles and how the stable periodic solutions lose their\nstability through a critical point which marks the onset of the unstable limit\ncycles.

The current research and development in physical layer security is\noften based on the ideal assumption of perfect channel knowledge or the\ncapability of variable-rate transmissions. In this work, we study the secure\ntransmission design in more practical scenarios by considering channel\nestimation errors at the receiver and investigating both fixed-rate and\nvariable-rate transmissions. Assuming quasi-static fading channels, we design\nsecure on-off transmission schemes to maximize the throughput subject to a\nconstraint on secrecy outage probability. For systems with given and fixed\nencoding rates, we show how the optimal on-off transmission thresholds and the\nachievable throughput vary with the amount of knowledge on the eavesdropper's\nchannel. In particular, our design covers the interesting case where the\neavesdropper also uses the pilots sent from the transmitter to obtain imperfect\nchannel estimation. An interesting observation is that using too much pilot\npower can harm the throughput of secure transmission if both the legitimate\nreceiver and the eavesdropper have channel estimation errors, while the secure\ntransmission always benefits from increasing pilot power when only the\nlegitimate receiver has channel estimation errors but not the eavesdropper.\nWhen the encoding rates are controllable parameters to design, we further\nderive both a non-adaptive and an adaptive rate transmission schemes by jointly\noptimizing the encoding rates and the on-off transmission thresholds to\nmaximize the throughput of secure transmissions.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in IEEE TIFS"]}]

For 30 years this was\nattributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (AGN) of low\nluminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN-sub-population, dominating in\nnumbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however,\nposes a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many\nLINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN. Using\nintegral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we aim at comparing\nthe observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from\nillumination by an AGN. Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of\nemission-lines, especially weak lines such as the Balmer Hb line which is\nsuperposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code\nwhich simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.\nWe show for 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, that the radial emission-line\nsurface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central\npoint-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone. The most probable\nexplanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars\nduring the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads\nus to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their\nionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with gas\npresent and stars older than ~1 Gyr, unless a stronger radiation field from\nyoung hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with\nLINER-like emission are in fact not a class defined by a property, but rather\nby the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed\nmostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures"]}]

More surprisingly, and directly\ncounter to Gogolin et al., we give an efficient algorithm that distinguishes\nthese two distributions with constant bias.

DeGroot's seminal idea is to base testing\nstatistical hypothesis on minimizing the weighted sum of type I plus type II\nerror instead of of the prevailing paradigm which is fixing type I error and\nminimizing type II error. DeGroot's result is that in simple vs simple\nhypothesis the optimal criterion is to reject, according to the likelihood\nratio as the evidence (ordering) statistics using a fixed threshold value,\ninstead of a fixed tail probability. By defining expected type I and type II\nerrors, we generalize DeGroot's approach and find that the optimal region is\ndefined by the ratio of evidences, that is, averaged likelihoods (with respect\nto a prior measure) and a threshold fixed. This approach yields an optimal\ntheory in complete generality, which the Classical Theory of Testing does not.\nThis can be seen as a Bayes-Non-Bayes compromise: the criteria (weighted sum of\ntype I and type II errors) is Frequentist, but the test criterion is the ratio\nof marginalized likelihood, which is Bayesian. We give arguments, to push the\ntheory still further, so that the weighting measures (priors)of the likelihoods\ndoes not have to be proper and highly informative, but just predictively\nmatched, that is that predictively matched priors, give rise to the same\nevidence (marginal likelihoods) using minimal (smallest) training samples.

The STA descriptors are local\nhistogram-based descriptors of space-time, suitable for building a partial\nrepresentation of arbitrary spatio-temporal phenomena. Because of the\npossibility of iterative refinement, they are interesting in the context of\nonline human action recognition. We investigate the use of dense optical flow\nas the image function of the STA descriptor for human action recognition, using\ntwo different algorithms for computing the flow: the Farneb\\\"ack algorithm and\nthe TVL1 algorithm. We provide a detailed analysis of the influencing optical\nflow algorithm parameters on the produced optical flow fields. An extensive\nexperimental validation of optical flow-based STA descriptors in human action\nrecognition is performed on the KTH human action dataset. The encouraging\nexperimental results suggest the potential of our approach in online human\naction recognition.\n","Comment: Part of the Proceedings of the Croatian Computer Vision Workshop,\n  CCVW 2013, Year 1"]}]

We\nconsider a social network in which each individual observes a private signal\nabout the underlying state of the world and communicates with her neighbors at\neach time period. Unlike many existing approaches, the underlying state is\ndynamic, and evolves according to a geometric random walk. We view the scenario\nas an optimization problem where agents aim to learn the true state while\nsuffering the smallest possible loss. Based on the decomposition of the global\nloss function, we introduce two update mechanisms, each of which generates an\nestimate of the true state. We establish a tight bound on the rate of change of\nthe underlying state, under which individuals can track the parameter with a\nbounded variance. Then, we characterize explicit expressions for the steady\nstate mean-square deviation(MSD) of the estimates from the truth, per\nindividual. We observe that only one of the estimators recovers the optimal\nMSD, which underscores the impact of the objective function decomposition on\nthe learning quality. Finally, we provide an upper bound on the regret of the\nproposed methods, measured as an average of errors in estimating the parameter\nin a finite time.\n","Comment: 12 pages, To appear in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)\n  2013"]}]
