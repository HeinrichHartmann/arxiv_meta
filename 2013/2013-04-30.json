A process for their backward evolution is referred to as a time reversed\nprocess. It is often greatly helpful to view a stochastic model from two\ndifferent time directions. In particular, if some property is unchanged under\ntime reversal, we may better understand that property. A concept of\nreversibility is invented for this invariance. Local balance for a stationary\nMarkov chain has been used for a weaker version of the reversibility. However,\nit is still too strong for queueing applications.\n  We are concerned with a continuous time Markov chain, but dose not assume it\nhas the stationary distribution. We define reversibility in structure as an\ninvariant property of a family of the set of models under certain operation.\nThe member of this set is a pair of transition rate function and its supporting\nmeasure, and each set represents dynamics of queueing systems such as arrivals\nand departures. We use a permutation {\\Gamma} of the family menmbers, that is,\nthe sets themselves, to describe the change of the dynamics under time\nreversal. This reversibility is is called {\\Gamma}-reversibility in structure.\n  To apply these definitions, we introduce new classes of models, called\nreacting systems and self-reacting systems.

Theoretical work and empirical\ninvestigation in Escherichia coli have shown that negative autoregulation\nconfers both rapid response times and reduced intrinsic noise, which is\nreflected in the fact that almost half of Escherichia coli transcription\nfactors are negatively autoregulated. However, negative autoregulation is\nexceedingly rare amongst the transcription factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nThis difference is all the more surprising because E. coli and S. cerevisiae\notherwise have remarkably similar profiles of network motifs. In this study we\nfirst show that regulatory interactions amongst the transcription factors of\nDrosophila melanogaster and humans have a similar dearth of negative\nautoregulation to that seen in S. cerevisiae.

As a result, the reduced-order model loses its\ncomputational efficiency, which, however, is its the most significant\nadvantage. Nonlinear dimensional reduction methods, such as the discrete\nempirical interpolation method, have been widely used to evaluate the nonlinear\nterms at a low cost. But when the finite element method is utilized for the\nspatial discretization, nonlinear snapshot generation requires inner products\nto be fulfilled, which costs lots of off-line time. Numerical integrations are\nalso needed over elements sharing the selected interpolation points during the\nsimulation, which keeps on-line time high. In this paper, we extend the finite\nelement method with interpolated coefficients to nonlinear reduced-order\nmodels. It approximates the nonlinear function in the reduced-order model by\nits finite element interpolation, which makes coefficient matrices of the\nnonlinear terms pre-computable and, thus, leads to great savings in the\ncomputational efforts. Due to the separation of spatial and temporal variables\nin the finite element interpolation, the discrete empirical interpolation\nmethod can be directly applied on the nonlinear functions. Therefore, the main\ncomputational hurdles when applying the discrete empirical interpolation method\nin the finite element context are conquered. We also establish a rigorous\nasymptotic error estimation, which shows that the proposed approach achieves\nthe same accuracy as that of the standard finite element method under certain\nsmoothness assumptions of the nonlinear functions.

The statistical sum of a such plat is related\nhere to the partition function of a two-component anyon gas.

When the processor is operating\nat a speed $s$, the energy consumed per unit time is given by a convex power\nfunction $P(s)$ having the property that $P(0) > 0$ and $P\"(s) > 0$ for all\nvalues of $s$. Moreover, $C > 0$ units of energy is required to make a\ntransition from the sleep state to the active state. The jobs are specified by\ntheir arrival time, deadline and the processing volume.\n  We consider a scheduling problem, called speed scaling with sleep state,\nwhere each job has to be scheduled within their arrival time and deadline, and\nthe goal is to minimize the total energy consumption required to process these\njobs. Albers et. al. proved the NP-hardness of this problem by reducing an\ninstance of an NP-hard partition problem to an instance of this scheduling\nproblem. The instance of this scheduling problem consists of the arrival time,\nthe deadline and the processing volume for each of the jobs, in addition to $P$\nand $C$. Since $P$ and $C$ depend on the instance of the partition problem,\nthis proof of the NP-hardness of the speed scaling with sleep state problem\ndoesn't remain valid when $P$ and $C$ are fixed. In this paper, we prove that\nthe speed scaling with sleep state problem remains NP-hard for any fixed\npositive number $C$ and convex $P$ satisfying $P(0) > 0$ and $P\"(s) > 0$ for\nall values of $s$.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Our previous work illustrated that the initial hydrogen densities of\nthe first equilibrium DSs are high, ~10^{17}/cm^3 for the case of 100 GeV\nWIMPs, with a stellar radius of ~2-3 AU. Subsequent authors have somehow missed\nthe fact that equilibrium DSs have the high densities they do. S12 have\nnumerically simulated the effect of dark matter annihilation on the contraction\nof a protostellar gas cloud en route to forming the first stars. They show\nresults at a density ~5 10^{14}/cm^3, slightly higher than the value at which\nannihilation heating prevails over cooling. However, they are apparently unable\nto reach the ~10^{17}/cm^3 density of our hydrostatic DS solutions. We are in\ncomplete agreement with their physical result that the gas keeps collapsing to\ndensities > 5 10^{14}/cm^3, as it must before equilibrium DSs can form. However\nwe are in disagreement with some of the words in their paper which imply that\nDSs never come to exist. It seems to us that S12 supports the DS scenario. They\nuse the sink particle approach to treat the gas that collapses to scales\nsmaller than their resolution limit. We argue that their sink is effectively a\nDS, or contains one. An accretion disk forms as more mass falls onto the sink,\nand the DS grows. S12 not only confirm our predictions about DS in the range\nwhere the simulations apply, but also solve a potential obstruction to DS\nformation by showing that dark matter annihilation prevents the fragmentation\nof the collapsing gas. Whereas fragmentation might perturb the dark matter away\nfrom the DS and remove its power source, instead S12 show that further sinks,\nif any, form only far enough away as to leave the DS undisturbed in the comfort\nof its dark matter surroundings.\n","Comment: 8 pages, no figure"]}]
