Spin lifetimes of up to ~100 ps are measured at\nroom temperature and vary little as the temperature is decreased to low\ntemperatures. However, the mobility of the STO has a strong temperature\ndependence. This behavior and the carrier doping dependence of the spin\nlifetime suggest that the spin lifetime is limited by spin-dependent scattering\nat the MgO/STO interfaces, perhaps related to the formation of doping induced\nTi3+.

One property that has been\nparticularly useful is negative correlation of the resulting vector.\nUnfortunately negative correlation has its limitations, and there are some\nfurther desirable properties that do not seem to follow from existing\ntechniques. In particular, recent concentration results for sums of independent\nrandom matrices are not known to extend to a negatively dependent setting.\n  We introduce a simple but useful technique called concavity of pessimistic\nestimators. This technique allows us to show concentration of submodular\nfunctions and concentration of matrix sums under pipage rounding. The former\nresult answers a question of Chekuri et al. (2009). To prove the latter result,\nwe derive a new variant of Lieb's celebrated concavity theorem in matrix\nanalysis.\n  We provide numerous applications of these results. One is to spectrally-thin\ntrees, a spectral analog of the thin trees that played a crucial role in the\nrecent breakthrough on the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We show a\npolynomial time algorithm that, given a graph where every edge has effective\nconductance at least $\\kappa$, returns an $O(\\kappa^{-1} \\cdot \\log n / \\log\n\\log n)$-spectrally-thin tree. There are further applications to rounding of\nsemidefinite programs, to the column subset selection problem, and to a\ngeometric question of extracting a nearly-orthonormal basis from an isotropic\ndistribution.\n"]}]

Observations of tornado\nprominences similar to the ones seen by SDO had already been documented by\nSecchi (1877) in his famous \"Le Soleil\". High resolution and high cadence\nmultiwavelength data obtained by SDO reveal that the tornado-like appearance of\nthese prominences is mainly an illusion due to projection effects. We discuss\ntwo different cases where prominences on the limb might appear to have a\ntornado-like behavior. One case of apparent vortical motions in prominence\nspines and barbs arises from the (mostly) 2D counterstreaming plasma motion\nalong the prominence spine and barbs together with oscillations along\nindividual threads. The other case of apparent rotational motion is observed in\nprominence cavities and results from the 3D plasma motion along the writhed\nmagnetic fields inside and along the prominence cavity as seen projected on the\nlimb. Thus, the \"tornado\" impression results either from counterstreaming and\noscillations or from the projection on the plane of the sky of plasma motion\nalong magnetic field lines, rather than from a true vortical motion around an\n(apparent) vertical or horizontal axis.

Our the- oretical analysis is based on the\nthree-orbital model, which takes into account t2g orbitals of Ti ions. Because\nof the interfacial breaking of mirror symmetry, a Rashba-type antisymmetric\nspin-orbit coupling arises from the cooperation of intersite and interorbital\nhybridyzation and atomic LS coupling. This model shows a characteristic spin\ntexture and carrier density dependence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling through\nthe orbital degree of freedom. Superconductivity is mainly caused by heavy\nquasiparticles consisting of dyz and dzx orbitals at high carrier densities. We\nfind that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling stabilizes a quasi-one-dimensional\nsuperconducting phase caused by one of the dyz or dzx orbitals at high magnetic\nfields along interfaces. This quasi-one-dimensional superconducting phase is\nprotected against para- magnetic depairing effects by the Rashba spin-orbit\ncoupling and realizes a large upper critical field Hc2 beyond the\nPauli-Clogston-Chandrasekhar limit.

A simple polynomial-time reduction reduces any input to one with at\nmost $k^2$ points. We show that this is essentially tight under standard\nassumptions.

In recent years, many different drift\ntheorems, including additive, multiplicative and variable drift, have been\ndeveloped, applied and partly generalized or adapted to particular processes. A\ncomprehensive overview article was missing.\n  We provide not only such an overview but also present a universal drift\ntheorem that generalizes virtually all existing drift theorems found in the\nliterature. On the one hand, the new theorem bounds the expected first hitting\ntime of optimal states in the underlying stochastic process. On the other hand,\nit also allows for general upper and lower tail bounds on the hitting time,\nwhich were not known before except for the special case of upper bounds in\nmultiplicative drift scenarios. As a proof of concept, the new tail bounds are\napplied to prove very precise sharp-concentration results on the running time\nof the (1+1) EA on OneMax, general linear functions and LeadingOnes. Moreover,\nuser-friendly specializations of the general drift theorem are given.\n","Comment: 34 pages"]}]
