This allows the writing of an equivalent\nform of Einstein's equation, which works for degenerate metric too.\n  Once we make the singularities manageable from mathematical viewpoint, we can\nextend analytically the black hole solutions and then choose from the maximal\nextensions globally hyperbolic regions. Then we find space-like foliations for\nthese regions, with the implication that the initial data can be preserved in\nreasonable situations. We propose qualitative models of non-primordial and/or\nevaporating black holes.\n  We supplement the material with a brief note reporting on progress made since\nthis talk was given, which shows that we can analytically extend the\nSchwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom metrics at and beyond the singularities,\nand the singularities can be made degenerate and handled with the mathematical\napparatus we developed.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 14 figures"]}]

This integrated optical dipole trap can\nsupport an atomic ensemble with a large optical depth due to its small mode\narea. Its quasi-TE0 waveguide mode has an advantage over the HE11 mode of a\nnanofiber, with little inhomogeneous Zeeman broadening at the trapping region.\nThe longitudinal confinement eliminates the need for a 1-D optical lattice,\nreducing collisional blockaded atomic loading, potentially producing larger\nensembles.

The distributions of optically-excited hot carriers are\ndramatically different in metal nanocrystals with large and small sizes. In\nlarge nanocrystals, most carriers have very small energies and the hot carrier\ndistribution resembles the case of a plasmon wave in bulk. In nanocrystals\nsmaller than 20nm, the carrier distribution extends to larger energies and\noccupies the whole region E_{F}<E<omega. The physical reason for the above\nbehaviors is non-conservation of momentum in a nanocrystal. Because of the\nabove properties, nanocrystals of small sizes are most suitable for designing\nof opto-electronic and photosynthetic devices based on injection of plasmonic\nelectrons and holes. The central parameter of the problem is\nDeltaN=omega/q_{L}*v_{F}, where q_{L} is the momentum transfer and v_{F} is the\nFermi velocity. In gold nanocrystals, when DeltaN<7, the high-energy\nhot-electron generation is efficient. For larger parameters DeltaN, the number\nof high-energy electrons is greatly reduced. Another important factor is the\npolarization of the exciting light.

In this\narticle we compare the localization/delocalization properties of one and two\nparticles. Whereas the metal-insulator transition is a consequence of\nsingle-particle Anderson localization, the superconductor-insulator transition\n(SIT) is due to pair localization - or, alternatively, fluctuations of the\nphase conjugate to pair density.

We address\nthis question using inhomogeneous mean field theory and quantum Monte Carlo\ntechniques and make several testable predictions for local spectroscopic probes\nacross the SIT. We show that with increasing disorder, the system forms\nsuperconducting blobs on the scale of the coherence length embedded in an\ninsulating matrix. In the superconducting state, the phases on the different\nblobs are coherent across the system whereas in the insulator long-range phase\ncoherence is disrupted by quantum fluctuations. As a consequence of this\nemergent granularity, we show that the single-particle energy gap in the\ndensity of states survives across the transition, but coherence peaks exist\nonly in the superconductor.
