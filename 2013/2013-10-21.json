One of the remarkable\nadvantages of our proposal is that even if the underlying target distribution\nis very high-dimensional, deterministic transformation of a one-dimensional\nrandom variable is sufficient to generate an appropriate Markov chain that is\nguaranteed to converge to the high-dimensional target distribution. Apart from\nclearly leading to massive computational savings, this idea of\ndeterministically transforming a single random variable very generally leads to\nexcellent acceptance rates, even though all the random variables associated\nwith the high-dimensional target distribution are updated in a single block.\nSince it is well-known that joint updating of many random variables using\nMetropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm generally leads to poor acceptance rates,\nTMCMC, in this regard, seems to provide a significant advance.

The\ngrain motion and the fluid pressure influence each other: It is well\nestablished that when the fluid pressure rises, the shear resistance of\nfluid-filled granular systems decreases, and as a result catastrophic events\nsuch as soil liquefaction, earthquakes, and accelerating landslides may be\ntriggered. Alternatively, when the pore pressure drops, the shear resistance of\nthese systems increases. Despite the great importance of the coupled mechanics\nof grains-fluid systems, the basic physics that controls this coupling is far\nfrom understood. We developed a new multi-scaled model based on the discrete\nelement method, coupled with a continuum model of fluid pressure, to explore\nthis dynamical system. The model was shown recently to capture essential\nfeedbacks between porosity changes arising from rearrangement of grains, and\nlocal pressure variations due to changing pore configurations. We report here\nnew results from numerical experiments of a continuously shearing layer of\ncircular two-dimensional grains, trapped between two parallel rough boundaries.\nThe experiments use a fixed confining stress on the boundary walls, and a\nconstant velocity applied to one of the boundaries, as if this system was the\ninterior of a sliding geological fault filled with 'fault gouge'. In addition,\nwe control the layer permeability and the drainage boundary conditions. This\npaper presents modeling results showing that the localization of shear (into a\nnarrow shear band within the shearing layer) is strongly affected by the\npresence of fluids. While in dry granular layers there is no preferred position\nfor the onset of localization, drained systems tend to localize shear on their\nboundary. We propose a scaling argument to describe the pressure deviations in\na shear band, and use that to predict the allowable positions of shear\nlocalizations as a function of the fault and gouge properties.\n","Comment: Fifth Biot Conference on Poromechanics, Vienna : Austria (2013)"]}]

More precisely, for a reproducing kernel Hilbert\nmodule $\\clh$ over $\\mathbb{C}[z_1, \\ldots, z_n]$ of analytic functions on the\npolydisc in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ which satisfies certain conditions, we characterize\nthe quotient modules $\\q$ of $\\clh$ such that $\\q$ is of the form $\\q_1 \\otimes\n\\cdots \\otimes \\q_n$, for some one variable quotient modules $\\{\\q_1, \\ldots,\n\\q_n\\}$. For $\\clh$ the Hardy module over polydisc $H^2(\\mathbb{D}^n)$, this\nreduces to some recent results by Izuchi, Nakazi and Seto and the third author.\nThis is used to obtain a classification of co-doubly commuting submodules for a\nclass of reproducing kernel Hilbert modules over the unit polydisc. These\nresults are applied to compute the cross commutators of co-doubly commuting\nsubmodules. This is used to give further insight into the wandering subspaces\nand ranks of submodules of the Hardy module case.
