We show that combination of an electric field and\nintrinsic spin-orbit interaction leads to quantum phase transitions at the\ncharge neutrality point. This phase transition from a two dimensional\ntopological insulator to a trivial insulating state is accompanied by a\nquenching of the quantum spin Hall effect and the onset of a quantum valley\nHall effect, providing a tool to experimentally tune the topological state of\nsilicene. In contrast to graphene and other conventional topological\ninsulators, the proposed effects in silicene are accessible to experiments.\n","Comment: 8 pages and 2 figures"]}]

Previous approaches to this Quantized Compressed Sensing (QCS)\nproblem based on Gaussian models (bounded l2-norm) for the quantization\ndistortion yield results that, while often acceptable, may not be fully\nconsistent: re-measurement and quantization of the reconstructed signal do not\nnecessarily match the initial observations. Quantization distortion instead\nmore closely resembles heteroscedastic uniform noise, with variance depending\non the observed quantization bin. Generalizing our previous work on uniform\nquantization, we show that for nonuniform quantizers described by the\n\"compander\" formalism, quantization distortion may be better characterized as\nhaving bounded weighted lp-norm (p >= 2), for a particular weighting. We\ndevelop a new reconstruction approach, termed Generalized Basis Pursuit DeNoise\n(GBPDN), which minimizes the sparsity of the reconstructed signal under this\nweighted lp-norm fidelity constraint. We prove that for B bits per measurement\nand under the oversampled QCS scenario (when the number of measurements is\nlarge compared to the signal sparsity) if the sensing matrix satisfies a\nproposed generalized Restricted Isometry Property, then, GBPDN provides a\nreconstruction error of sparse signals which decreases like\nO(2^{-B}/\\sqrt{p+1}): a reduction by a factor \\sqrt{p+1} relative to that\nproduced by using the l2-norm. Besides the QCS scenario, we also show that\nGBPDN applies straightforwardly to the related case of CS measurements\ncorrupted by heteroscedastic Generalized Gaussian noise with provable\nreconstruction error reduction. Finally, we describe an efficient numerical\nprocedure for computing GBPDN via a primal-dual convex optimization scheme, and\ndemonstrate its effectiveness through simulations.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 9 figures"]}]

These results have important implications\nfor the regularization of positive definite matrices, where functions are often\napplied to only the off-diagonal elements to obtain sparse matrices with better\nproperties (e.g., Markov random field/graphical model structure, better\ncondition number). As a particular case, it is shown that\n\\emph{soft-thresholding}, a commonly used operation in modern high-dimensional\nprobability and statistics, is not guaranteed to maintain positive\ndefiniteness, even if the original matrix is sparse. This result has a deep\nconnection to graphs, and in particular, to the class of trees. We then proceed\nto fully characterize functions which do preserve positive definiteness. This\ncharacterization is in terms of absolutely monotonic functions and turns out to\nbe quite different from the case when the function is also applied to diagonal\nelements.

This suggests that it would be inappropriate to dismiss a system as\nnot being critical purely based on an inability to rigorously fit a power law\ndistribution as has been recently advocated. In assessing whether a system,\nespecially a finite-size one, is critical it is thus important to consider\nother possible markers.

In two\ndimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized\nenergy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. In 1976\nDouglas Hofstadter theoretically considered the intersection of these two\nproblems and discovered that 2D electrons subjected to both a magnetic field\nand a periodic electrostatic potential exhibit a self-similar recursive energy\nspectrum. Known as Hofstadter's butterfly, this complex spectrum results from a\ndelicate interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two\nquantizing fields, and represents one of the first quantum fractals discovered\nin physics. In the decades since, experimental attempts to study this effect\nhave been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical\ncrystalline systems (<1 nm periodicity) require impossibly large magnetic\nfields to reach the commensurability condition, while in artificially\nengineered structures (>100 nm), the corresponding fields are too small to\ncompletely overcome disorder. Here we demonstrate that moire superlattices\narising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a nearly\nideal-sized periodic modulation, enabling unprecedented experimental access to\nthe fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall effect features associated\nwith the fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers,\nand report evidence of their recursive structure.

Here we report a fourfold oscillation in the anisotropic magneto\nresistance (AMR) and the observation of planar Hall effect (PHE) at the\nLaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterointerface. We evaluate the carrier confinement\neffects on the AMR and find that the fourfold oscillation appears only for the\ncase of 2DEG system while it is twofold for the 3D system. As the fourfold\noscillation fits well to the phenomenological model for a cubic symmetry\nsystem, we attribute this oscillation to the anisotropy in the magnetic\nscattering arising from the interaction of electrons with the localized\nmagnetic moments coupled to the crystal symmetry. The AMR behavior is further\nfound to be sensitive to applied gate electric field, emphasizing the\nsignificance of spin-orbit coupling at the interface. These confinement effects\nsuggest that the magnetic interactions are predominant at the interface, and\nthe gate electric field modulation of AMR suggest the possible gate tunable\nmagnetic interactions in these systems. The observed large PHE further\nindicates that the in plane nature of magnetic ordering arises from the\nin-plane Ti 3dxy orbitals.\n","Comment: Main manuscript: 20 pages, Figures: 5, Supplementary Information: 5\n  pages"]}]

Although a rich theory has\narisen from this viewpoint, cf. [L1], idempotent semirings possess a restricted\nalgebraic structure theory, and also do not reflect certain valuation-theoretic\nproperties, thereby forcing researchers to rely often on combinatoric\ntechniques.\n  In this paper we describe an alternative structure, more compatible with\nvaluation theory, studied by the authors over the past few years, that permits\nfuller use of algebraic theory especially in understanding the underlying\ntropical geometry. The idempotent max-plus algebra $A$ of an ordered monoid\n$\\tM$ is replaced by $R: = L\\times \\tM$, where $L$ is a given indexing semiring\n(not necessarily with 0). In this case we say $R$ layered by $L$. When $L$ is\ntrivial, i.e, $L=\\{1\\}$, $R$ is the usual bipotent max-plus algebra. When\n$L=\\{1,\\infty\\}$ we recover the \"standard\" supertropical structure with its\n\"ghost\" layer. When $L = \\NN $ we can describe multiple roots of polynomials\nvia a \"layering function\" $s: R \\to L$. Likewise, one can define the layering\n$s: R^{(n)} \\to L^{(n)}$ componentwise; vectors $v_1, \\dots, v_m$ are called\ntropically dependent if each component of some nontrivial linear combination\n$\\sum \\a_i v_i$ is a ghost, for \"tangible\" $\\a_i \\in R$. Then an $n\\times n$\nmatrix has tropically dependent rows iff its permanent is a ghost.\n  We explain how supertropical algebras, and more generally layered algebras,\nprovide a robust algebraic foundation for tropical linear algebra, in which\nmany classical tools are available. In the process, we provide some new results\nconcerning the rank of d-independent sets (such as the fact that they are\nsemi-additive),put them in the context of supertropical bilinear forms, and lay\nthe matrix theory in the framework of identities of semirings.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]
