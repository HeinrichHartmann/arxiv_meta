The calculated velocity dispersion results from theory and simulations\nshows a good agreement with the velocity dispersion results of (Abdullah et al.\n\\cite{Abd11}). An Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), Grid based hybrid code have\nbeen used to carry out the simulations. Our results indicate that the average\nvelocity dispersion profile of $20$ Abell galaxy clusters falls in the range of\n$500-1000$ km/s and their temperature profile is of the order of $10^7$ to\n$10^8$K calculated on the basis of kinetic theory. The data in the plot shows a\nsignificant contribution of gravitating particles clustering together in the\nvicinity of cluster center and beyond a certain region this velocity dies out\nand gets dominated by the Hubble's flow due to which all the galaxy clusters in\nan expanding universe participate in Hubble's expansion.\n","Comment: 7 Pages, 1 figure"]}]
