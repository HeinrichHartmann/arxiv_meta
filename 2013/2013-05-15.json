Using a local Taylor expansion method we study the low-redshift\nconditions to obtain an apparent negative deceleration parameter $q^{app}(z)$\nderived from the luminosity distance $D_L(z)$ for a central observer in a LTB\nspace, confirming that central smoothness implies a positive central\ndeceleration. Since observational data is only available at redshift greater\nthan zero we find the critical values of the parameters defining a centrally\nsmooth LTB model which give a positive apparent acceleration at $z>0$,\nproviding a graphical representation of the conditions in the\n$q_0^{app},q_1^{app}$ plane, which are respectively the zero and first order\nterms of the central Taylor expansion of $q^{app}(z)$. We finally derive a\ncoordinate independent expression for the apparent deceleration parameter based\non the expansion of the relevant functions in red-shift rather than in the\nradial coordinate.\n  We calculate $q^{app}(z)$ with two different methods to solve the null\ngeodesic equations, one based on a local central expansion of the solution in\nterms of cosmic time and the other one using the exact analytical solution in\nterms of generalized conformal time. %The expansion of the solution in terms of\ncosmic time is quite useful also for other applications requiring foliation %of\nspace-time in space-like hyper-surfaces, such as spatial averaging, which is\nmuch more difficult to study using the %analytical solution in terms of the\ngeneralized conformal time coordinate.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures, abstract, added section with coordinate\n  independent conditions, version accepted for publication in GRG"]}]

The present formulation represents an extension\nof recent work that establishes a consistent size-dependent theory for solid\nmechanics.

Next, the constitutive relations, displacement\nformulations, the uniqueness theorem and the reciprocal theorem for the\ncorresponding linear small deformation size-dependent piezoelectricity are\ndeveloped. As with existing flexoelectric formulations, one finds that the\npiezoelectric effect can also exist in isotropic materials, although in the\npresent theory the coupling is strictly through the skew-symmetric mean\ncurvature tensor.

At an even higher current, these skyrmions are\nstrongly deformed due to the damping and become unstable at a threshold\ncurrent, leading to a chiral liquid. We show how skyrmions can be created by\nincreasing the current in the magnetic spiral state. We then construct a\ndynamic phase diagram for a chiral magnet with a current. The instability\ntransitions between different states can be observed as experimentally clear\nsignatures in the transport measurements, such as jumps and hysteresis.\n","Comment: 5 pages and 4 figures; more details than the published version are\n  included"]}]

A natural question is how to\nusefully define a domain-independent coordinate system for such a collection of\ngraphs, so that the set of possible structures can be compactly represented and\nunderstood within a common space. In this work, we draw on the theory of graph\nhomomorphisms to formulate and analyze such a representation, based on\ncomputing the frequencies of small induced subgraphs within each graph. We find\nthat the space of subgraph frequencies is governed both by its combinatorial\nproperties, based on extremal results that constrain all graphs, as well as by\nits empirical properties, manifested in the way that real social graphs appear\nto lie near a simple one-dimensional curve through this space.\n  We develop flexible frameworks for studying each of these aspects. For\ncapturing empirical properties, we characterize a simple stochastic generative\nmodel, a single-parameter extension of Erdos-Renyi random graphs, whose\nstationary distribution over subgraphs closely tracks the concentration of the\nreal social graph families. For the extremal properties, we develop a tractable\nlinear program for bounding the feasible space of subgraph frequencies by\nharnessing a toolkit of known extremal graph theory. Together, these two\ncomplementary frameworks shed light on a fundamental question pertaining to\nsocial graphs: what properties of social graphs are 'social' properties and\nwhat properties are 'graph' properties?\n  We conclude with a brief demonstration of how the coordinate system we\nexamine can also be used to perform classification tasks, distinguishing\nbetween social graphs of different origins.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

We\nexamine this question, existing approaches, and present two novel families of\nsolutions, applicable in different settings. In particular, it is demonstrated\nthat a simple biologically plausible formula gives rise to an an unbiased (but\nnoisy) estimator of the gradient with respect to a binary stochastic neuron\nfiring probability. Unlike other estimators which view the noise as a small\nperturbation in order to estimate gradients by finite differences, this\nestimator is unbiased even without assuming that the stochastic perturbation is\nsmall. This estimator is also interesting because it can be applied in very\ngeneral settings which do not allow gradient back-propagation, including the\nestimation of the gradient with respect to future rewards, as required in\nreinforcement learning setups. We also propose an approach to approximating\nthis unbiased but high-variance estimator by learning to predict it using a\nbiased estimator. The second approach we propose assumes that an estimator of\nthe gradient can be back-propagated and it provides an unbiased estimator of\nthe gradient, but can only work with non-linearities unlike the hard threshold,\nbut like the rectifier, that are not flat for all of their range.

The new technology of vertical ICs places circuit blocks in the\nvertical dimension in addition to the conventional horizontal plane. Compared\nto the planar ICs, vertical ICs have shorter latencies as well as lower power\nconsumption due to shorter wires. This also increases speed, improves\nperformances and adds to ICs density. The benefits of vertical ICs increase as\nwe stack more dies, due to successive reductions in wire lengths. However, as\nwe stack more dies, the lattice self-heating becomes a challenging and critical\nissue due to the difficulty in cooling down the layers away from the heat sink.\nIn this paper, we provide a quantitative electro-thermal analysis of the\ntemperature rise due to stacking. Mathematical models based on steady state\nnon-isothermal drift-diffusion transport equations coupled to heat flow\nequation are used. These physically based models and the different heat sources\nin semiconductor devices will be presented and discussed. Three dimensional\nnumerical results did show that, compared to the planar ICs, the vertical ICs\nwith 2-die technology increase the maximum temperature by 17 Kelvin in the die\naway from the heat sink. These numerical results will also be presented and\nanalyzed for a typical 2-die structure of complementary metal oxide\nsemiconductor (CMOS) transistors.\n"]}]

They admit two notions of morphism: logical morphisms which preserve all\nof the structure and therefore the interpretation of higher order logic, and\ngeometric morphisms which only preserve only some of the structure and\ntherefore only some of the interpretation of higher order logic. The question\nthen arises: what kinds of higher order theories are preserved by geometric\nmorphisms? It is known that certain first order theories called internal\ngeometric theories are preserved by geometric morphisms, and these admit what\nare known as classifying topoi. Briefly, a classifying topos for an internal\ngeometric theory $\\mathbb{T}$ in a topos $\\mathcal{E}$ is a topos\n$\\mathcal{E}[\\mathbb{T}]$ such that models of $\\mathbb{T}$ in any topos\n$\\mathcal{F}$ with a geometric morphism to $\\mathcal{E}$ are in one to one\ncorrespondence with geometric morphisms from $\\mathcal{F}$ to\n$\\mathcal{E}[\\mathbb{T}]$ over $\\mathcal{E}$. One useful technique for showing\nthat a higher order theory $\\mathcal{T}$ is preserved by geometric morphisms is\nto define an internal geometric theory $\\mathbb{T}$ of \"bad sets\" for\n$\\mathcal{T}$ and show that $\\mathcal{T}$ is equivalent to the higher order\ntheory which says \"the classifying topos for $\\mathbb{T}$ is degenerate\". We\nset up a deduction calculus for internal geometric theories and show that it\nproves a contradiction if and only if the classifying topos of that theory is\ndegenerate. We use this result to study a variant of the higher order theory of\nDedekind finite objects and the higher order theory of field objects considered\nas ring objects with no non-trivial ideals.\n"]}]
