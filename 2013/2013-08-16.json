Fisher and Muller proposed that\nrecombination provides an evolutionary advantage in large populations by\nalleviating this competition.

We solve the infinite population dynamics\nexactly and show that, for a particular, natural mutation scheme, the speed of\nadaptation in sexuals is twice as large as in asexuals. Guided by the infinite\npopulation result and by previous work on asexual adaptation, we postulate an\nexpression for the speed of adaptation in finite sexual populations that agrees\nwith numerical simulations over a wide range of population sizes and\nrecombination rates. The ratio of the sexual to asexual adaptation speed is a\nfunction of population size that increases in the clonal interference regime\nand approaches 2 for extremely large populations. The simulations also show\nthat the imbalance between the numbers of accumulated mutations at the two loci\nis strongly suppressed even by a small amount of recombination. The\ngeneralization of the model to an arbitrary number $L$ of loci is briefly\ndiscussed. If each offspring samples the alleles at each locus from the gene\npool of the whole population rather than from two parents, the ratio of the\nsexual to asexual adaptation speed is approximately equal to $L$ in large\npopulations.

The\nflattening of f_(N,z) in the sub-DLA regime is present in the observations. The\nredshift evolution of f_(N,z) down to sub-DLA regime is also presented,\nindicating the presence of more sub-DLAs at high-redshift as compared to\nlow-redshift. f_(N,z) is further used to determine the neutral gas mass\ndensity, Omega_g, at 1.5 < z < 5.0. The complete sample shows that sub-DLAs\ncontribute 8-20% to the total Omega_g from 1.5 < z < 5.0. In agreement with\nprevious studies, no evolution of Omega_g is seen from low-redshift to\nhigh-redshift, suggesting that star formation solely cannot explain this\nnon-evolution and replenishment of gas and/or recombination of ionized gas is\nneeded.

As a part of the characterization, a new transmission method\ncalled space-time interference alignment is proposed, which exploits both the\ncurrent and past CSI jointly. Using the proposed alignment technique, an inner\nbound of the sum-DoF region is characterized as a function of a normalized CSI\nfeedback frequency, which measures CSI feedback speed compared to the speed of\nuser's channel variations. One consequence of the result is that the achievable\nsum-DoF gain is improved significantly when a user sends back both current and\noutdated CSI compared to the case where the user sends back current CSI only.\nThen, a trade-off between CSI feedback delay and the sum-DoF gain is\ncharacterized for the multi-user vector broadcast channel in terms of a\nnormalized CSI feedback delay that measures CSI obsoleteness compared to\nchannel coherence time. A crucial insight is that it is possible to achieve the\noptimal DoF gain if the feedback delay is less than a derived fraction of the\nchannel coherence time.

Whereas for small and moderate time scales as well as\nfor few excitatory interactions, the dynamics stays stable, there is a smooth\ntransition to chaos if the synaptic response becomes sufficiently slow (even in\npurely inhibitory networks) or the number of excitatory interactions becomes\ntoo large. These results indicate that chaotic and stable dynamics are equally\ncapable of generating the irregular neuronal activity.

Now a days, most of the web browsers offer auto\nlogin feature for the favorite web sites such as yahoo, google, gmail etc.\nusing these credential information. This facilitates the misuse of user\ncredentials. Privatizing user credential information of web services in a\nshared user environment provides a feature enhancement where the root user will\nbe able to privatize his stored credentials by enforcing some masking\ntechniques such that even a user logs on to the system with root user\ncredentials, he will not be able to access privatized data. In case of web\nbrowsers auto login feature, a root user can disable the feature manually by\ndeleting entries from web browsers' saved password list. But this involves\nspending a considerable amount of time and the biggest problem is that he has\nto insert those credentials once again when he next visits these websites. This\napplication resumes auto login feature whenever root user disable the masked\nmode. The application includes two parts: Masked Application Mode and Disabling\nthe Masked Application Mode. When the system goes for masked application mode,\nthe other user will not be able to use the credentials of the root user.If the\nother user tries to access any of the web pages which have been masked, the\nother user will have to authenticate with his own credentials. Disabling the\nmasked mode requires authentication from the root user. As long as this\ncredential is not shared, masked mode can be disabled only by the root user.\n","Comment: Selected for proceedings of NETs2012 International Conference on\n  Internet Studies held in Bangkok, Thailand from August 17-19, 2012"]}]

To complement the VHE\nobservations, simultaneous MWL data were collected in high energy gamma-rays\nusing the \\textit{Fermi Large Area Telescope (HE, 300 MeV - 100 GeV), in the\nX-ray and UV band with the \\textit{Swift} satellite, in the optical R--band\nthrough observations with the KVA telescope and in the radio band using the\nOVRO telescope. This constitutes the first time that such a broad band coverage\nhas been obtained for this source. We study the source properties through the\ncharacterization of the spectral energy distribution (SED) and its evolution\nthrough two different VHE flux states.
