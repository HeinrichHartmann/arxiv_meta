Studies that\nsystematically determine the conditions required to initiate detonations in C/O\nmaterial exist, but until now no analogous investigation of He matter has been\nconducted. We perform one-dimensional reactive hydrodynamical simulations at a\nvariety of initial density and temperature combinations and find critical\nlength scales for the initiation of He detonations that range between 1 -\n$10^{10}$ cm. A simple estimate of the length scales over which the total\nconsumption of fuel will occur for steady-state detonations is provided by the\nChapman-Jouguet (CJ) formalism. Our initiation lengths are consistently smaller\nthan the corresponding CJ length scales by a factor of $\\Sim 100$, providing\nopportunities for thermonuclear explosions in a wider range of low-mass white\ndwarfs (WDs) than previously thought possible. We find that virialized WDs with\nas little mass as 0.24 $M_\\odot$ can be detonated, and that even less massive\nWDs can be detonated if a sizable fraction of their mass is raised to a higher\nadiabat. That the initiation length is exceeded by the CJ length implies that\ncertain systems may not reach nuclear statistical equilibrium within the time\nit takes a detonation to traverse the object. In support of this hypothesis, we\ndemonstrate that incomplete burning will occur in the majority of He WD\ndetonations and that $^{40}$Ca, $^{44}$Ti, or $^{48}$Cr, rather than $^{56}$Ni,\nis the predominant burning product for many of these events.

This unexpected behavior can be understood as arising due to\na common path interference between two distinct tunneling solutions. The\nphenomenon is insensitive to magnetic field, and arises whenever the low energy\ndispersion relation contains higher order terms in addition to the usual $p^2$\nterm. Such higher order terms are generically present, albeit with small\nco-efficient, so that the oscillatory Zener tunneling is a universal\nphenomenon. However, the first `Zener oscillation' occurs at a transmission\nprobability which is exponentially small when the co-efficient of the higher\norder terms is small. This explains why this oscillatory aspect of Zener\ntunneling has been hitherto overlooked, despite its universality. The common\npath interference is also destroyed by the presence of odd powers of $p$ in the\nlow energy dispersion relation. Since odd powers of $p$ are strictly absent\nonly when the tunneling barrier lies along an axis of mirror symmetry, it\nfollows that the robustness of the oscillatory behavior depends on the\norientation of the tunneling barrier.

Although apparently simple in its scope, the study of ionic dynamics\nin confined geometries has revealed interesting new phenomena that have an\nalmost one-to-one correspondence with the quantum regime. The picture that\nemerges is that ions can form two `quasi-particle' states, one in which they\nsurround themselves with other ions of opposite charge - ionic atmosphere - and\none in which semi-bound water molecules form layers at different distances from\nthe ions - hydration layers. The second state gives rise to two additional\neffects. In the first, which is a single quasi-particle effect, the ionic\nconductance through a nanopore is predicted to be `quantized' as a function of\npore radius, with the corresponding `quantization units' not related to\nuniversal constants - like the Plank constant and the elementary charge - but\nrather to the radii of the hydration layers. The second effect instead involves\nthe many-body interaction among ionic quasi-particles of the same sign, and\noccurs when the pore has a finite capacitance to accommodate ions so that there\nis a threshold concentration beyond which ions of the same sign are not\nenergetically allowed to enter the pore. Similar to the electron transport\ncase, the ionic counterpart appears only in the `quantum' regime, when the\nhydration layers forming the ionic quasi-particles need to break in order to\npass through the pore. Here, we review all these phenomena, and discuss the\nconditions under which they may be detected making the analogy with the\nelectronic transport case. Since nanopores are being considered for a host of\ntechnological applications in DNA sequencing and detection, we expect these\nphenomena will become very relevant and their understanding paramount to\nprogress.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 11 figures"]}]

In this work, by means of\ntheoretical ab-initio calculations we investigate the effect of strain on the\nopto-electronic properties of Si-NCs pairs. We consider two sources of strain:\nthe strain induced by an embedding SiO2 matrix, and the strain generated by\nmutual NC-NC forces occurring at small distances. Independently on its source,\nwe observe a fundamental impact of the strain on the orbitals localization and,\nas a consequence, on the transition probability between energy states,\nbelonging or not to the same NC. The resulting picture allots to the structural\nstrain a fundamental role in the NC-NC interaction mechanisms, suggesting the\npossibility of enabling a strain-controlled response in Si-NC ensambles.\n"]}]
