The connection between the two parts\nis the notion of \"categorification\" which we shortly explain/recall in the\nintroduction.\n  In the first part of this thesis we extend Bar-Natan's cobordism based\ncategorification of the Jones polynomial to virtual links. Our topological\ncomplex allows a direct extension of the classical Khovanov complex (h=t=0),\nthe variant of Lee (h=0,t=1) and other classical link homologies. We show that\nour construction allows, over rings of characteristic 2, extensions with no\nclassical analogon, e.g. Bar-Natan's Z/2Z-link homology can be extended in two\nnon-equivalent ways.\n  Our construction is computable in the sense that one can write a computer\nprogram to perform calculations, e.g. we have written a MATHEMATICA based\nprogram.\n  Moreover, we give a classification of all unoriented TQFTs which can be used\nto define virtual link homologies from our topological construction.\nFurthermore, we prove that our extension is combinatorial and has semi-local\nproperties. We use the semi-local properties to prove an application, i.e. we\ngive a discussion of Lee's degeneration of virtual homology.\n  In the second part of this thesis (which is based on joint work with Mackaay\nand Pan) we use Kuperberg's sl3 webs and Khovanov's sl3 foams to define a new\nalgebra K_S, which we call the sl3 web algebra. It is the sl3 analogue of\nKhovanov's arc algebra H_n.\n  We prove that K_S is a graded symmetric Frobenius algebra. Furthermore, we\ncategorify an instance of q-skew Howe duality, which allows us to prove that\nK_S is Morita equivalent to a certain cyclotomic KLR-algebra. This allows us to\ndetermine the split Grothendieck group K_0(K_S), to show that its center is\nisomorphic to the cohomology ring of a certain Spaltenstein variety, and to\nprove that K_S is a graded cellular algebra.\n","Comment: 189 pages, many figures, Ph.D. thesis"]}]
