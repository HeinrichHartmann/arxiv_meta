Although community detection methods abound, there is a\nlack of consensus on how to quantify and rank the quality of partitions. We\nshow here that the quality of a partition can be measured in terms of its\nstability, defined in terms of the clustered autocovariance of a Markov process\ntaking place on the graph. Because the stability has an intrinsic dependence on\ntime scales of the graph, it allows us to compare and rank partitions at each\ntime and also to establish the time spans over which partitions are optimal.\nHence the Markov time acts effectively as an intrinsic resolution parameter\nthat establishes a hierarchy of increasingly coarser clusterings. Within our\nframework we can then provide a unifying view of several standard partitioning\nmeasures: modularity and normalized cut size can be interpreted as one-step\ntime measures, whereas Fiedler's spectral clustering emerges at long times. We\napply our method to characterize the relevance and persistence of partitions\nover time for constructive and real networks, including hierarchical graphs and\nsocial networks.

The existence\nof misbehaving nodes may paralyze the routing operation in MANETs. To overcome\nthis behavior, the trustworthiness of the network nodes should be considered in\nthe route selection process combined with the hop count. The trustworthiness is\nachieved by measuring the trust value for each node in the network. In this\npaper, a new protocol based on self monitoring (agent-based) and following the\ndynamic source routing (DSR) algorithm is presented. This protocol is called\nAgent-Based Trusted Dynamic Source Routing (ATDSR) Protocol for MANETs. The\nobjective of this protocol is to manage trust information locally with minimal\noverhead in terms of extra messages and time delay. This objective is achieved\nthrough installing in each participated node in the network a multi-agent\nsystem (MAS). MAS consists of two types of agents: monitoring agent (MOA) and\nrouting agent (ROA). A new mathematical and more realistic objective model for\nmeasuring the trust value is introduced. This model is weighted by both number\nand size of routed packets to reflect the selective forwarding behavior of a\nnode. The performance evaluation via simulation shows that our protocol is\nbetter than standard and trusted DSR.

The degree of compensation determines whether\nrecruitment respectively decreases, saturates, or increases at high levels of\nspawning stock biomass. In 1982 J.G. Shepherd united these dynamics into a\nsingle model, where the degree of compensation is determined by a single\nparameter, however the difficulty in relating this parameter to biological data\nhas limited its usefulness. Here we use a generalized modeling framework to\nshow that the degree of compensation can be related directly to the functional\nelasticity of growth, which is a general quantity that measures the change in\nrecruitment relative to a change in biomass, irrespective of the specific SRR.\nWe show that the elasticity of growth can be calculated from short-term\nfluctuations in fish biomass, is robust to observation error, and can be used\nto determine general attributes of the SRR in both continuous time production\nmodels, as well as discrete time age-structured models. This framework may be\nparticularly useful if fisheries time-series data are limited, and not\nconducive to determining functional relationships using traditional methods of\nstatistical best-fit.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, 1 table"]}]

The analysis concerns the exact sparsity case, i.e.,\nthe maximum number of non-zero components in the vectors of parameters in the\nfirst-stage equations, k1, and the number of non-zero components in the vector\nof parameters in the second-stage equation, k2, are allowed to grow with n but\nslowly compared to n.

This will enable direct imaging searches for, and\nsubsequent characterization of, companions around cool, low-mass stars for the\nfirst time, as well as routine visible-light imaging twice as sharp as HST for\nfainter targets. PULSE will reuse the laser and wavefront sensor technologies\ndeveloped for the automated Robo-AO laser system currently operating at the\nPalomar 60-inch telescope, as well as take advantage of pending optimization of\nlow-order NGS wavefront sensing and planned new interfaces to the PALM-3000\nreal-time reconstruction computer. The laser measurements will drive the 3,388\nactive element high-order deformable mirror in open-loop, while an adaptive\noptics sharpened faint natural source will be measured by the current PALM-3000\nwavefront sensor in its lowest spatial sampling mode, with commands sent in\nclosed-loop to the 241 active element low-order deformable mirror. The natural\nguide star loop corrects for both the relatively weak low-order high-altitude\nturbulence as well as functioning as both the tip-tilt and low-bandwidth\n`truth' sensor loops in a traditional laser adaptive optics system.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, 1 table"]}]
