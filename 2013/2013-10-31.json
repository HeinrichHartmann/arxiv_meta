In this work, we\ntheoretically investigate the possibility that the outflow results from\ninteraction between the wind and the ambient gas in the form of turbulent\nentrainment. In contrast to the previous models, turbulent motion of the\nambient gas around the protostar is taken into account. In our model, the\nram-pressure of the wind balances the turbulent ram-pressure of the ambient\ngas, and the outflow consists of the ambient gas entrained by the wind. The\ncalculated outflow from our modelling exhibits a conical shape. The total mass\nof the outflow is determined by the turbulent velocity of the envelope as well\nas the outflow age, and the velocity of the outflow is several times higher\nthan the velocity dispersion of the ambient gas. The outflow opening angle\nincreases with the strength of the wind and decreases with the increasing\nambient gas turbulence. The outflow exhibits a broad line width at every\nposition.

We first describe two key science drivers: 1) the evolution of grains\nin protoplanetary disks and debris disks, and 2) molecular gas in galaxies\nduring the era of re-ionization. Studies of these topics with Band 1 receivers\nwill significantly expand ALMA's Level 1 Science Goals.

For example, ALMA Band 1\ncontinuum data will probe the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect in galaxy clusters,\nVery Small Grains and spinning dust, ionized jets from young stars, spatial and\nflaring studies of Sgr A*, the acceleration sites of solar flares, pulsar wind\nnebulae, radio supernovae, and X-ray binaries.

The average outward speed of\nthe first jet is $\\approx 171$ km s$^{-1}$, well below the escape speed, hence\nif simple ballistic motion is considered, the plasma will not escape the Sun.\nThe second jet was observed in the south polar coronal hole with three XRT\nfilters, namely, C$_{-}$poly, Al$_{-}$poly, and Al$_{-}$mesh filters. We\nobserved that the second jet drifted at all altitudes along the jet with the\nsame drift speed of $\\simeq$ 7 km s$^{-1}$. The enhancement in the light curves\nof low-temperature EIS lines in the later phase of the jet lifetime and the\nshape of the jet's stack plots suggests that the jet material is falls back,\nand most likely cools down. To support this conclusion, the observed drifts\nwere interpreted within a scenario where reconnection progressively shifts\nalong a magnetic structure, leading to the sequential appearance of jets of\nabout the same size and physical characteristics. On this basis, we also\npropose a simple qualitative model that mimics the observations.\n","Comment: Accepted Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

It was\nfirst observed in computer simulations of the causal dynamical triangulation\n(CDT) approach to quantum gravity and refers to the reduction of the spectral\ndimension from 4 at classical scales to 2 at short distances. Thereafter\nseveral authors confirmed a similar result from different approaches to quantum\ngravity. Despite the contribution from different approaches, no analytical\nmodel was proposed to explain the numerical results as the continuum limit of\nCDT. In this thesis we introduce graph ensembles as toy models of CDT and show\nthat both the continuum limit and a scale dependent spectral dimension can be\ndefined rigorously. First we focus on a simple graph ensemble, the random comb.\nIt does not have any dynamics from the gravity point of view, but serves as an\ninstructive toy model to introduce the characteristic scale of the graph, study\nthe continuum limit and define the scale dependent spectral dimension. Having\ndefined the continuum limit, we study the reduction of the spectral dimension\non more realistic toy models, the multigraph ensembles, which serve as a radial\napproximation of CDT. We focus on the (recurrent) multigraph approximation of\nthe two-dimensional CDT whose ensemble measure is analytically controlled. The\nlatter comes from the critical Galton-Watson process conditioned on\nnon-extinction. Next we turn our attention to transient multigraph ensembles,\ncorresponding to higher-dimensional CDT. Firstly we study their fractal\nproperties and secondly calculate the scale dependent spectral dimension and\ncompare it to computer simulations.

This paper provides new results along this\nresearch line and presents new algorithms for performing minimal model finding\nand checking over positive propositional CNFs and model minimization over\npropositional CNFs. An algorithmic schema, called the Generalized Elimination\nAlgorithm (GEA) is presented, that computes a minimal model of any positive\nCNF. The schema generalizes the Elimination Algorithm (EA) [BP97], which\ncomputes a minimal model of positive head-cycle-free (HCF) CNF theories. While\nthe EA always runs in polynomial time in the size of the input HCF CNF, the\ncomplexity of the GEA depends on the complexity of the specific eliminating\noperator invoked therein, which may in general turn out to be exponential.\nTherefore, a specific eliminating operator is defined by which the GEA\ncomputes, in polynomial time, a minimal model for a class of CNF that strictly\nincludes head-elementary-set-free (HEF) CNF theories [GLL06], which form, in\ntheir turn, a strict superset of HCF theories. Furthermore, in order to deal\nwith the high complexity associated with recognizing HEF theories, an\n\"incomplete\" variant of the GEA (called IGEA) is proposed: the resulting\nschema, once instantiated with an appropriate elimination operator, always\nconstructs a model of the input CNF, which is guaranteed to be minimal if the\ninput theory is HEF.

We\nfurther provide experimental evidence suggesting that when the girth of a Nash\nequilibrium is increasing, the upper bound on {\\alpha} obtained by the simple\nstrategy changes is not increasing. To the end, we investigate the approach for\na coalitional variant of Nash equilibrium, where coalitions of two players\ncannot collectively improve, and show that if {\\alpha} >= 41n, then every such\nNash equilibrium is a tree.\n"]}]
