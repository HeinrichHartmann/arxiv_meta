A popular strategy of localization is to\nuse the measured differences in arrival times of source signals at multiple\npairs of receivers. In the literature, most algorithms that are based on time\ndifferences of arrival (TDOA) assume that the propagation velocity is a\nconstant as a function of the source position, which is valid for air\npropagation or even for narrow band signals. However a bounded medium such as a\nconcrete slab (encountered in indoor environement) is usually dispersive and\ndamped.

This peculiar behaviour\nprecludes any possibility to rely on existing localization methods in indoor\nenvironment. Therefore, a new localization algorithm that is adapted to a\ndamped and dispersive medium is proposed, using only on the sign of the\nmeasured TDOA (SO-TDOA).

These models require solving an elliptic sub-problem at each time\nstep, which takes the bulk of the computational time. The method we propose\nhere is a modular approach that facilitates data transfer with simple\ninterpolations and uses black-box solvers for solving the elliptic sub-problem\nand potential vorticity equations in the QG flow solvers. After solving the\nelliptic sub-problem on a coarsened grid, an interpolation scheme is used to\nobtain the fine data for subsequent time stepping on the full grid. The\npotential vorticity field is then updated on the fine grid with savings in\ncomputational time due to the reduced number of grid points for the elliptic\nsolver. The method is applied to both single layer barotropic and two-layer\nstratified QG ocean models for mid-latitude oceanic basins in the beta plane,\nwhich are standard prototypes of more realistic ocean dynamics. The method is\nfound to accelerate these computations while retaining the same level of\naccuracy in the fine-resolution field. A linear acceleration rate is obtained\nfor all the cases we consider due to the efficient linear-cost fast Fourier\ntransform based elliptic solver used. We expect the speed-up of the CGP method\nto increase dramatically for versions of the method that use other, suboptimal,\nelliptic solvers, which are generally quadratic cost. It is also demonstrated\nthat numerical oscillations due to lower grid resolutions, in which the Munk\nscales are not resolved adequately, are effectively eliminated with CGP method.\n","Comment: International Journal for Multiscale Computational Engineering, 2013.\n  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1212.0140,\n  arXiv:1212.0922, arXiv:1104.2730"]}]

After including all the correction for the\ninstrumental effects, the relative photometric calibration accuracy\n(repeatability) will be as good as 0.5% in the blue and green band and 2% in\nthe red band. This excellent calibration starts to reveal possible\ninconsistencies between the models of the K-type and the M-type stellar\ncalibrators. The absolute calibration accuracy is therefore mainly limited by\nthe 5% uncertainty of the celestial standard models in all three bands.

We first introduce an abstract\nalgebraic framework for the formulation of mathematical models of physical\nsystems that is general enough to encompass classical and quantum mechanical\nmodels. After a short discussion on the properties of classical systems\n(realism and determinism), we move on to the study of a general class of\nquantum-mechanical models of physical systems and explain what some of the key\nproblems in a quantum theory of observations and measurements are. In the last\npart of our essay, we attempt to elucidate the roles played by entanglement\nbetween a system and its environment and of information loss in understanding\n\"decoherence\" and \"dephasing\", which are key mechanisms in a quantum theory of\nmeasurements and experiments. We also discuss the problem of \"time in quantum\nmechanics\" and sketch an answer to the question when an experiment can be\nconsidered to have been completed successfully.\n"]}]

The gamma-ray detector,\nAGILE-GRID, has observed Galactic and extragalactic sources, many of which were\ncollected in the first AGILE Catalog. Aims: We present the calibration of the\nAGILE-GRID using in-flight data and Monte Carlo simulations, producing\nInstrument Response Functions (IRFs) for the effective area A_eff), Energy\nDispersion Probability (EDP), and Point Spread Function (PSF), each as a\nfunction of incident direction in instrument coordinates and energy. Methods:\nWe performed Monte Carlo simulations at different gamma-ray energies and\nincident angles, including background rejection filters and Kalman filter-based\ngamma-ray reconstruction. Long integrations of in-flight observations of the\nVela, Crab and Geminga sources in broad and narrow energy bands were used to\nvalidate and improve the accuracy of the instrument response functions.\nResults: The weighted average PSFs as a function of spectra correspond well to\nthe data for all sources and energy bands. Conclusions: Changes in the\ninterpolation of the PSF from Monte Carlo data and in the procedure for\nconstruction of the energy-weighted effective areas have improved the\ncorrespondence between predicted and observed fluxes and spectra of celestial\ncalibration sources, reducing false positives and obviating the need for\npost-hoc energy-dependent scaling factors.

Whereas a stable sort based\nlexicographical sorting algorithm operates from the least important to most\nimportant features, in contrast, QuickLexSort sorts from the most important to\nleast important features, refining the sort as it goes. QuickLexSort first\nrequires a one-time modest pre-processing step where each feature of the data\nset is sorted independently. When lexicographically sorting a database,\nQuickLexSort (including pre-processing) has comparable running time to using a\nstable sort based approach. For a data base with $m$ rows and $n$ columns, and\na sorting algorithm running in time $O(mlog(m))$, a stable sort based\nlexicographical sort and QuickLexSort will both take time $O(nmlog(m))$.\nHowever in many applications one has the need to lexicographically sort nested\ndata, e.g.\\ all possible sub-matrices up to a certain cardinality of columns.\nIn such cases we show QuickLexSort gives a performance improvement of a log\nfactor of the database length (rows in matrix) over using a standard stable\nsort based approach.

This is a nearly finished piece of\nmathematics, thanks heroic breakthroughs by Viro, Fiedler, Korchagin, Shustin,\nChevallier, Orevkov, yet still leaving undecided six tantalizing bosons among a\nmenagerie of 104 logically possible distributions of ovals (respecting\nB\\'ezout, Gudkov periodicity, and the Fiedler-Viro imparity law sieving away\n4+36 schemes). This quest inevitably involves glimpsing deep into the nebula\nreferrable to as Viro's patchworking, and the likewise spectacular\nobstructional laws of Fiedler, Viro, Shustin, Orevkov. In the overall, the game\nis much comparable to a pigeons hunting video-game, where 144 birds are\nliberated in nature, with some of them strong enough to fly higher and higher\nin the blue sky as to rejoin the stratospheric paradise of eternal life\n(construction of a scheme in the algebro-geometric category). Some other, less\nfortunate, birds were killed (a long time ago) and crashed down miserably over\nterrestrial crust (prohibition). Alas, the hunt is unfinished with still six\nbirds, apparently too feeble to rally safely the paradise, yet too acrobatic\nfor any homosapiens being skillful enough to shoot them down.\n","Comment: 424 pages; 164 Figures"]}]

While the results fall\nshort of showing that MRP implies SCH, it will be shown that MRP implies that\nif SCH fails first at kappa then every stationary subset of S_{kappa^+}^omega =\n{a < kappa^+ : cf(a) = omega} reflects. It will also be demonstrated that MRP\nalways fails in a generic extension by Prikry forcing.\n","Comment: 7 pages"]}]
