To date, observations from\nthe X-Ray Sensor (XRS) onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite (GOES) have been used to derive these properties, but have been\nlimited by a number of factors, including the lack of a consistent background\nsubtraction method capable of being automatically applied to large numbers of\nflares. In this paper, we describe an automated temperature and emission\nmeasure-based background subtraction method (TEBBS), which builds on the\nmethods of Bornmann (1990). Our algorithm ensures that the derived temperature\nis always greater than the instrumental limit and the pre-flare background\ntemperature, and that the temperature and emission measure are increasing\nduring the flare rise phase. Additionally, TEBBS utilizes the improved\nestimates of GOES temperatures and emission measures from White et al.

We confirm that the peak emission\nmeasure and total radiative losses scale with background subtracted GOES X-ray\nflux as power-laws, while the peak temperature scales logarithmically. As\nexpected, the peak emission measure shows an increasing trend with peak\ntemperature, although the total radiative losses do not. While these results\nare comparable to previous studies, we find that flares of a given GOES class\nhave lower peak temperatures and higher peak emission measures than previously\nreported.
