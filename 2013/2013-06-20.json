We consider the issue of judgement aggregation from the\nperspective of approximation. That is, we generalize the previous results by\nstudying approximate judgement aggregation. We relax the main two constraints\nassumed in the current literature, Consistency and Independence and consider\nmechanisms that only approximately satisfy these constraints, that is, satisfy\nthem up to a small portion of the inputs. The main question we raise is whether\nthe relaxation of these notions significantly alters the class of satisfying\naggregation mechanisms. The recent works for preference aggregation of Kalai,\nMossel, and Keller fit into this framework. The main result of this paper is\nthat, as in the case of preference aggregation, in the case of a subclass of a\nnatural class of aggregation problems termed `truth-functional agendas', the\nset of satisfying aggregation mechanisms does not extend non-trivially when\nrelaxing the constraints.

It is well known that\na weak probe beam experiences a greater phase shift from a strong pump beam\nthan the pump beam induces on itself. The physical mechanism behind the\nenhanced phase shift is diffraction of pump light into the probe direction by a\nnonlinear refractive index grating produced by interference between the two\nbeams. For an instantaneous third-order response, the effect of the grating is\nto simply double the probe phase shift, but when delayed nonlinearities are\nconsidered, the effect is more complex. A comprehensive treatment is given for\nboth degenerate and nondegenerate pump-probe experiments in noble and diatomic\ngases. Results of numerical calculations are compared to a recent transient\nbirefringence measurement [Loriot et al., Opt. Express 17, 13429 (2009)] and a\nrecent spectral interferometry experiment [Wahlstrand et al., Phys. Rev. A 85,\n043820 (2012)]. We also present results from two new experiments using\nspectrally-resolved transient birefringence with 800 nm pulses in Ar and air\nand degenerate chirped pulse spectral interferometry in Ar. Both experiments\nsupport the interpretation of the negative birefringence at high intensity as\narising from a plasma grating.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Warm\ninflation provides a natural arena to address this issue, with interactions\nbetween the scalar inflaton and other degrees of freedom leading to dissipative\nentropy production and associated thermal fluctuations. In this context, we\npresent relations between CMB observables that can be directly tested against\nobservational data. In particular, we show that the presence of a thermal bath\nwarmer than the Hubble scale during inflation decreases the tensor-to-scalar\nratio with respect to the conventional prediction in supercooled inflation,\nyielding $r< 8|n_t|$, where $n_t$ is the tensor spectral index. Focusing on\nsupersymmetric models at low temperatures, we determine consistency relations\nbetween the observables characterizing the spectrum of adiabatic scalar and\ntensor modes, both for generic potentials and particular canonical examples,\nand which we compare with the WMAP and Planck results.

The clustering\nalgorithm is a key technique used to increase the scalability and life span of\nthe network in general. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a distributed\nenergy-efficient clustering algorithm for WSNs. This heterogeneous-energy\nprotocol is a new clustering algorithm to decrease probability of failure nodes\nand in which we introduce the node's remaining energy so as to determine the\ncluster heads. We study the impact of heterogeneity of nodes on WSNs that are\nhierarchically clustered.

To improve the debugging process efficiency, some effort was already\nmade to automatically assist the detection and location of software faults.\nThis led to the creation of statistical debugging tools such as Tarantula,\nZoltar and GZoltar.

To assess the validity\nof our proposed approach, an empirical evaluation was performed, injecting\nfaults in four real-world software projects.

Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we\nshow that 1-M TMAO and 7-M urea solutions act dramatically differently on these\nmodel polymer chains. Their behaviors are sensitive to the strength of the\nattractive dispersion interactions of the chain with its environment: when\nthese dispersion interactions are high enough, TMAO suppresses the formation of\nextended conformations of the hydrophobic polymer as compared to water, while\nurea promotes formation of extended conformations. Similar trends are observed\nexperimentally on real protein systems. Quite surprisingly, we find that both\nprotecting and denaturing osmolytes strongly interact with the polymer,\nseemingly in contrast with existing explanations of the osmolyte effect on\nproteins. We show that what really matters for a protective osmolyte is its\neffective depletion as the polymer conformation changes, which leads to a\nnegative change in the preferential binding coefficient. For TMAO, there is a\nmuch more favorable free energy of insertion of a single osmolyte near\ncollapsed conformations of the polymer than near extended conformations. By\ncontrast, urea is preferentially stabilized next to the extended conformation\nand thus has a denaturing effect.\n"]}]
