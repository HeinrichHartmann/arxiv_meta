Although there are variety of methods for solving such problems,\nmost statisticians find constrained estimation challenging. The current paper\nproposes a new path following algorithm for quadratic programming based on\nexact penalization. Similar penalties arise in $l_1$ regularization in model\nselection. Classical penalty methods solve a sequence of unconstrained problems\nthat put greater and greater stress on meeting the constraints. In the limit as\nthe penalty constant tends to $\\infty$, one recovers the constrained solution.\nIn the exact penalty method, squared penalties are replaced by absolute value\npenalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty\nconstant. The exact path following method starts at the unconstrained solution\nand follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the\nprocess, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various\nconstraints. Path following in lasso penalized regression, in contrast, starts\nwith a large value of the penalty constant and works its way downward. In both\nsettings, inspection of the entire solution path is revealing. Just as with the\nlasso and generalized lasso, it is possible to plot the effective degrees of\nfreedom along the solution path. For a strictly convex quadratic program, the\nexact penalty algorithm can be framed entirely in terms of the sweep operator\nof regression analysis. A few well chosen examples illustrate the mechanics and\npotential of path following.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The standard analysis shows that\nthis estimate x' satisfies ||x'-x||_infty^2 < ||x_tail||_2^2 / k, where x_tail\nis the vector containing all but the largest k coordinates of x. Our main\nresult is that most of the coordinates of x' have substantially less error than\nthis upper bound; namely, for any c < O(log n), we show that each coordinate i\nsatisfies (x'_i - x_i)^2 < (c/log n) ||x_tail||_2^2/k with probability\n1-2^{-Omega(c)}, as long as the hash functions are fully independent.

We develop an\nargument that the image of the city arises from the underlying scaling of city\nartifacts or locations. This scaling refers to the fact that, in an imageable\ncity (a city that can easily be imaged in human minds), small city artifacts\nare far more common than large ones; or alternatively low dense locations are\nfar more common than high dense locations. The sizes of city artifacts in a\nrank-size plot exhibit a heavy tailed distribution consisting of the head,\nwhich is composed of a minority of unique artifacts (vital and very important),\nand the tail, which is composed of redundant other artifacts (trivial and less\nimportant). Eventually, those extremely unique and vital artifacts in the top\nhead, i.e., what Lynch called city elements, make up the image of the city. We\nargue that the ever-increasing amount of geographic information on cities, in\nparticular obtained from social media such as Flickr and Twitter, can turn\nresearch on the image of the city, or cognitive mapping in general, into a\nquantitative manner.

The uncertainty in heterogeneous\nstructure properties is often parameterized by a high-dimensional random\nvariable. This leads to a deterministic problem in a high-dimensional parameter\nspace and the numerical computation becomes very challengeable as the dimension\nof the parameter space increases. To efficiently tackle the\nhigh-dimensionality, we propose a hybrid high dimensional model representation\n(HDMR) technique, through which the high-dimensional stochastic model is\ndecomposed into a moderate-dimensional stochastic model in a most active random\nspace and a few one-dimensional stochastic models. The derived low-dimensional\nstochastic models are solved by incorporating sparse grid stochastic\ncollocation method into the proposed hybrid HDMR. The porous media properties\nsuch as permeability are often heterogeneous. To treat the heterogeneity, we\nuse a mixed multiscale finite element method (MMsFEM) to simulate each of\nderived stochastic models. To capture the non-local spatial features of the\nporous media and the important effects of random variables, we can\nhierarchically incorporate the global information individually from each of\nrandom parameters.

Over the past several decades, it has\nbeen recognised that this approach only determines the asymptotic stability of\nthe system, and neglects the possibility of transient perturbation growth\narising due to the nonnormality of the system. This observation motivated the\ndevelopment of a more powerful generalised stability theory (GST), which\nfocusses instead on the singular value decomposition of the linearised\npropagator of the system. While GST has had significant successes in\nunderstanding the stability of phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics, its\nmore widespread applicability has been hampered by the fact that computing the\nSVD requires both the tangent linear operator and its adjoint: deriving the\ntangent linear and adjoint models is usually a considerable challenge, and\nmanually embedding them inside an eigensolver is laborious. In this paper, we\npresent a framework for the automation of generalised stability theory, which\novercomes these difficulties. Given a compact high-level symbolic\nrepresentation of a finite element discretisation implemented in the FEniCS\nsystem, efficient C++ code is automatically generated to assemble the forward,\ntangent linear and adjoint models; these models are then used to calculate the\noptimally growing perturbations to the forward model, and their growth rates.\nBy automating the stability computations, we hope to make these powerful tools\na more routine part of computational analysis. The efficiency and generality of\nthe framework is demonstrated with applications drawn from geophysical fluid\ndynamics, phase separation and quantum mechanics.\n","Comment: Accepted in SISC"]}]

The renormalized\ncontribution of the divergent fermionic vacuum fluctuation at one loop level\nmakes these models effective QCD-like models. It has been explicitly shown that\nanalytical expressions for the model parameters, meson masses, and mixing\nangles do not depend on any arbitrary renormalization scale.

These genes encode a primary antigen\nprotein called PfEMP1, which is expressed on the surface of infected red blood\ncells and elicits protective immune responses. Var gene sequences are\ncharacterized by pronounced mosaicism, precluding the use of traditional\nphylogenetic tools that require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary\nrelationships. We present a new method that identifies highly variable regions\n(HVRs), and then maps each HVR to a complex network in which each sequence is a\nnode and two nodes are linked if they share an exact match of significant\nlength. Here, networks of var genes that recombine freely are expected to have\na uniformly random structure, but constraints on recombination will produce\nnetwork communities that we identify using a stochastic block model. We\nvalidate this method on synthetic data, showing that it correctly recovers\npopulations of constrained recombination, before applying it to the Duffy\nBinding Like-{\\alpha} (DBL{\\alpha}) domain of var genes. We find nine HVRs\nwhose network communities map in distinctive ways to known DBL{\\alpha}\nclassifications and clinical phenotypes.

Rather the emission domain lies just outside a\ntimelike Marginal Outer Trapped Surface that is locally defined. The emission\ndomain is mainly located inside the event horizon. A spacelike singularity\nforms behind the event horizon, and most of the Hawking radiation ends up at\nthis singularity rather than at infinity. Whether any Hawking radiation reaches\ninfinity depends on the relation between the emission domain and the event\nhorizon.

Although it is a simple model,\ncompression methods become necessary because datasets are increasingly larger\nand various scalability issues arise around their organization and storage.\nThis requirement is more restrictive in RDF stores because efficient SPARQL\nresolution on the compressed RDF datasets is also required.\n  This article introduces a novel RDF indexing technique (called k2-triples)\nsupporting efficient SPARQL resolution in compressed space. k2-triples, uses\nthe predicate to vertically partition the dataset into disjoint subsets of\npairs (subject, object), one per predicate. These subsets are represented as\nbinary matrices in which 1-bits mean that the corresponding triple exists in\nthe dataset. This model results in very sparse matrices, which are efficiently\ncompressed using k2-trees. We enhance this model with two compact indexes\nlisting the predicates related to each different subject and object, in order\nto address the specific weaknesses of vertically partitioned representations.\nThe resulting technique not only achieves by far the most compressed\nrepresentations, but also the best overall performance for RDF retrieval in our\nexperiments. Our approach uses up to 10 times less space than a state of the\nart baseline, and outperforms its performance by several order of magnitude on\nthe most basic query patterns. In addition, we optimize traditional join\nalgorithms on k2-triples and define a novel one leveraging its specific\nfeatures.

Understanding the\nconditions for invasion in a two-locus model can elucidate these processes. For\ninstance, selection can act differently upon the sexes, or sex-linkage can\nfacilitate the invasion of genetic variation with opposing fitness effects\nbetween the sexes. Two factors that deserve further attention are recombination\nrates and allele frequencies -- both of which can vary substantially between\nthe sexes. We find that sex-specific recombination rates in a two-locus diploid\nmodel can affect the invasion outcome of sexually antagonistic alleles and that\nthe sex-averaged recombination rate is not necessarily sufficient to predict\ninvasion. We confirm that the range of permissible recombination rates is\nsmaller in the sex benefitting from invasion and larger in the sex harmed by\ninvasion. However, within the invasion space, male recombination rate can be\ngreater than, equal to, or less than female recombination rate in order for a\nmale-benefit, female-detriment allele to invade (and similarly for a\nfemale-benefit, male-detriment allele). We further show that a novel, sexually\nantagonistic allele that is also associated with a lowered recombination rate\ncan invade more easily when present in the double heterozygote genotype.\nFinally, we find that sexual dimorphism in resident allele frequencies can\nimpact the invasion of new sexually antagonistic alleles at a second locus.

To\naddress these challenges, several graph-parallel frameworks including Pregel\nand GraphLab (PowerGraph) have been developed recently.

While retaining\nthe vertex-centric programming model, GRE proposes two new abstractions: 1) a\nScatter-Combine computation model based on active message to exploit massive\nfined-grained edge-level parallelism, and 2) a Agent-Graph data model based on\nvertex factorization to partition and represent directed graphs.

This phenomenon, which can be attributed to\nmonogamy of entanglement, stands in sharp contrast to the classical setting.\nThe complementary, more intuitive, result also holds: an upper bound on the\nsoundness when the code is defined on poor small-set expanders (a bound which\nturns out to be far more difficult to show in the quantum case).
