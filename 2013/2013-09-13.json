The natural\nvalue of the energy density of the equilibrium the self-sustained vacuum is\nzero. Cosmology is discussed as the process of relaxation of vacuum towards the\nequilibrium state. The present value of the cosmological constant is very small\ncompared to the Planck scale, because the present Universe is very old and thus\nis close to equilibrium. Momentum space topology determines the universality\nclasses of fermionic vacua. The Standard Model vacuum both in its massless and\nmassive states is topological medium. The vacuum in its massless state shares\nthe properties of superfluid 3He-A, which is topological superfluid. It belongs\nto the Fermi-point universality class, which has topologically protected\nfermionic quasiparticles. At low energy they behave as relativistic massless\nWeyl fermions. Gauge fields and gravity emerge together with Weyl fermions at\nlow energy.

For such systems, we review\nthe reduction of the vacuum Einstein field equations to their most concise form\nby dimensionally reducing to the three-dimensional space of orbits of the\nKilling vector, followed by a conformal rescaling. The resulting field\nequations can be written as a problem in three-dimensional gravity with a\ncomplex scalar field as source. This scalar field, the Ernst potential is\nconstructed from the norm and twist of the spacelike Killing field. In the case\nwhere the axial Killing vector is twist-free, we discuss the properties of the\naxis and simplify the field equations using a triad formalism. We study two\nphysically motivated triad choices that further reduce the complexity of the\nequations and exhibit their hierarchical structure. The first choice is adapted\nto a harmonic coordinate that asymptotes to a cylindrical radius and leads to a\nsimplification of the three-dimensional Ricci tensor and the boundary\nconditions on the axis. We illustrate its properties by explicitly solving the\nfield equations in the case of static axisymmetric spacetimes. The other choice\nof triad is based on geodesic null coordinates adapted to null infinity as in\nthe Bondi formalism. We then explore the solution space of the twist-free\naxisymmetric vacuum field equations, identifying the known (unphysical)\nsolutions together with the assumptions made in each case. This singles out the\nnecessary conditions for obtaining physical solutions to the equations.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 3 figures, reflects published version"]}]

Since real synthesized particles have polydispersity not only in size but\nalso in shape, we explore here the phase behavior of binary mixtures of hard\nconvex polyhedra having similar sizes but different shapes. Choosing\nrepresentative particle shapes from those readily synthesizable, we study in\nparticular four mixtures: (i) cubes and spheres (with spheres providing a\nnon-polyhedral reference case), (ii) cubes and truncated octahedra, (iii) cubes\nand cuboctahedra, and (iv) cuboctahedra and truncated octahedra. The phase\nbehavior of such mixtures is dependent on the interplay of mixing and packing\nentropy, which can give rise to miscible or phase-separated states. The extent\nof mixing of two such particle types is expected to depend on the degree of\nshape similarity, relative sizes, composition, and compatibility of the crystal\nstructures formed by the pure components. While expectedly the binary systems\nstudied exhibit phase separation at high pressures due to the incompatible\npure-component crystal structures, our study shows that the essential\nqualitative trends in miscibility and phase separation can be correlated to\nproperties of the pure components, such as the relative values of the\norder-disorder transition pressure (ODP) of each component.

It enjoys many attractive properties such as an exact\nsemi-definite linear programming relaxation (SDP relaxation) and strong\nduality. Unfortunately, such properties do not, in general, hold for an\nextended trust-region problem having extra linear constraints. This paper shows\nthat two useful and powerful features of the classical trust-region problem\ncontinue to hold for an extended trust-region problem with linear inequality\nconstraints under a new dimension condition. First, we establish that the class\nof extended trust-region problems has an exact SDP-relaxation, which holds\nwithout the Slater constraint qualification. This is achieved by proving that a\nsystem of quadratic and affine functions involved in the model satisfies a\nrange-convexity whenever the dimension condition is fulfilled. Second, we show\nthat the dimension condition together with the Slater condition ensures that a\nset of combined first and second-order Lagrange multiplier conditions is\nnecessary and sufficient for global optimality of the extended trust-region\nproblem and consequently for strong duality. Finally, we show that the\ndimension condition is easily satisfied for the extended trust-region model\nthat arises from the reformulation of a robust least squares problem (LSP) as\nwell as a robust second order cone programming model problem (SOCP) as an\nequivalent semi-definite linear programming problem.

Changes to the initial plasma\npressure and to magnetic parameters are investigated systematically.An\ninitially tilted fan is associated with a non-zero Lorentz force that drives\nthe fan and spine to collapse towards each other, in a similar manner to the\ncollapse of a 2D X-point.

The continued growth of this peak\nindicates that the system is in an asymptotic regime involving an infinite time\nsingularity at the null. When the initial tilt disturbance (current\nperpendicular to the spine) is combined with a spiral-type disturbance (current\nparallel to the spine), the final current density concentrates in three\nregions: one on the fan along its tilt axis and two around the spine, above and\nbelow the fan.

To get the\nmaximum efficiency, only radiative recombination has been considered using\ntypical radiative recombination parameters of the direct band gap III-V\nsemiconductors, and explicit energy dependence of light absorption. When\nsimulating the efficiency, we selfconsistently took into account the fact that\nthe amount of the heat dissipated by SC decreases as the number of\ncurrent-matched sub-cells increases. As the operating SCs temperature decreases\nboth the open-circuit voltage and the photoconversion efficiency increase. It\nis shown that the above effect is especially strong for SCs operating under AM0\nconditions. As the number of subcells is increased, narrowing the spectral\nrange for each subcell, the photocurrent is additionally reduced due to the\nenergy dependent light absorption, the factor generally ignored in the standard\napproaches.

This allows each node to conserve energy and\ncontribute to increasing the lifetime of the network. In this paper, in\ncontrast to most previous work, we consider (i) both the energy costs of\ncommunication as well as the amount of available energy at each node, (ii) the\nrealistic situation of varying rates of energy consumption at different nodes,\nand (iii) the fact that co-operation between nodes, where some nodes make a\nsacrifice by increasing energy consumption to help other nodes reduce their\nconsumption, can be used to extend network lifetime. This paper introduces a\nnew distributed topology control algorithm, called the Cooperative Topology\nControl with Adaptation (CTCA), based on a game-theoretic approach that maps\nthe problem of maximizing the network's lifetime into an ordinal potential\ngame. We prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium for the game. Our simulation\nresults indicate that the CTCA algorithm extends the life of a network by more\nthan 50% compared to the best previously-known algorithm. We also study the\nperformance of the distributed CTCA algorithm in comparison to an optimal\ncentralized algorithm as a function of the communication ranges of nodes and\nnode density.\n"]}]
