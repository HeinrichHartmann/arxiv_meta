One might expect these two concepts to be related, but\nunfortunately examples demonstrate that there is no way in general to deduce\nthe Krein signature of an eigenvalue from the Evans function.\n  The purpose of this paper is to recall and popularize a simple graphical\ninterpretation of the Krein signature well-known in the spectral theory of\npolynomial operator pencils. This interpretation avoids altogether the need to\nview the Krein signature in terms of root subspaces and their relation to\nindefinite quadratic forms. To demonstrate the utility of this graphical\ninterpretation of the Krein signature, we use it to define a simple\ngeneralization of the Evans function -- the Evans-Krein function -- that allows\nthe calculation of Krein signatures in a way that is easy to incorporate into\nexisting Evans function evaluation codes at virtually no additional\ncomputational cost. The graphical Krein signature also enables us to give\nelegant proofs of index theorems for linearized Hamiltonians in the finite\ndimensional setting: a general result implying as a corollary the generalized\nVakhitov-Kolokolov criterion (or Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss criterion) and a\ncount of real eigenvalues for linearized Hamiltonian systems in canonical form.\nThese applications demonstrate how the simple graphical nature of the Krein\nsignature may be easily exploited.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 5 figures, submitted to SIAM Review"]}]

In particular, the social welfare cannot be approximated by a\nbetter factor then the number of players. Therefore, the literature has mainly\nresorted to Pareto-efficiency as a way to achieve efficiency in such settings.\nWhile successful in some important scenarios, in many settings it is known that\neither exactly one incentive-compatible auction that always outputs a\nPareto-efficient solution, or that no truthful mechanism can always guarantee a\nPareto-efficient outcome.

We estimate redshifts\nfor all extragalactic objects, and find a good correspondence of our predicted\nredshift with the measured redshift (a mean error of 0.04 in $\\Delta z$. There\nappears to be a supercluster at z $\\sim$ 0.3-0.35 in this direction, including\nmany of the galaxies in the X-ray error circles are found in this redshift\nrange.\n","Comment: 45 pages, 21 figures, AJ in press, Version with full resolution\n  figures available from http://www.lamost.org/~zht/xray.zip"]}]
