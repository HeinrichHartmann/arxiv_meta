The ionization structure is maintained by both the AGN\npower-law continuum and starburst. The galaxy is a bright X-ray source\npossessing a low X-ray column density N_H < 4 x 10^20 cm^{-2}.

Natural roads\nare joined road segments that perceptually constitute good continuity. This\napproach relies on the connectivity of natural roads rather than that of road\nsegments for computing routes or map directions. Because of this, the derived\nroutes posses the fewest turns. However, what we intend to achieve are the\nroutes that not only possess the fewest turns, but are also as short as\npossible. This kind of map direction is more effective and favorable by people,\nbecause they bear less cognitive burden. Furthermore, the computation of the\nroutes is more efficient, since it is based on the graph encoding the\nconnectivity of roads, which is significantly smaller than the graph of road\nsegments. We made experiments applied to eight urban street networks from North\nAmerica and Europe in order to illustrate the above stated advantages. The\nexperimental results indicate that the fewest-turn routes posses fewer turns\nand shorter distances than the simplest paths and the routes provided by Google\nMaps. For example, the fewest-turn-and-shortest routes are on average 15%\nshorter than the routes suggested by Google Maps, while the number of turns is\njust half as much.

In contrast, currently\nthere is no clear understanding about their exact complexities in external\nmemory.\n  This paper presents several structures of linear size for answering the above\nqueries with the optimal I/O cost.

When bulk dephasing takes place in the system, diffusive transport\nis induced in the weakly-interacting regime, with the heat current\nmonotonically decreasing with the dephasing rate. In contrast, in the\nstrongly-interacting regime, the heat current can be significantly enhanced by\ndephasing for systems of small size.\n"]}]

That is, it is usually not\nexplored which background information makes NC true or false. The present paper\naims to fill this gap. For us, \"(objective) background knowledge\" is restricted\nto information that can be expressed as probability events. Any other\nconfiguration is regarded as being subjective and a property of the a priori\nprobability distribution. We study NC in two specific settings. In the first\ncase, a complete description of some individuals is known, e.g. one knows of\neach of a group of individuals whether they are black and whether they are\nravens. In the second case, the number of individuals having a particular\nproperty is given, e.g. one knows how many ravens or how many black things\nthere are (in the relevant population). While some of the most famous answers\nto the paradox are measure-dependent, our discussion is not restricted to any\nparticular probability measure. Our most interesting result is that in the\nsecond setting, NC violates a simple kind of inductive inference (namely\nprojectability). Since relative to NC, this latter rule is more closely related\nto, and more directly justified by our intuitive notion of inductive reasoning,\nthis tension makes a case against the plausibility of NC. In the end, we\nsuggest that the informal representation of NC may seem to be intuitively\nplausible because it can easily be mistaken for reasoning by analogy.\n","Comment: On raven paradox, Nicod's condition, projectability, induction"]}]

A small fractional\nchange in the oxygen content, resulting in the variation of valence state of\nthe transition metal, can drastically modify the materials functionalities. In\nparticular, TMOs with mixed valences have attracted attention for many energy\napplications. Previous studies also showed that the ability to control the\nnumber of d-band electron populations and detailed spin configurations is\ncritical for improved catalytic performance of TMOs. In this context,\nSrCoO$_{x}$ (2.5 < x < 3.0) is an ideal class of materials due to the existence\nof two structurally distinct topotatic phases, i.e. the brownmillerite\nSrCoO$_{2.5}$(BM-SCO) and the perovskite SrCoO$_{3}$. Especially, BM-SCO has\natomically-ordered one-dimensional vacancy channels, which can accommodate\nadditional oxygen. Moreover, SrCoO$_{x}$ exhibits a wide spectrum of physical\nproperties depending on the oxygen stoichiometry. Since SrCoOx has only a\nsingle knob to control the Co valence state without cation doping, it is an\nattractive material for studying the valence state dependent physical\nproperties. However, so far, the growth of high quality single crystalline\nmaterials has not been much studied due to difficulty in controlling the right\noxidation state. In this work, we report on the epitaxial growth of BM-SCO\nsingle crystalline films on SrTiO3 by pulsed laser epitaxy. In order to examine\nthe topotactic phase transformation to the perovskite SrCoO$_{3-\\delta}$, some\nof samples were subsequently in-situ annealed at various oxygen pressure\nP(O$_{2}$).

Here, we present\nnovel analyses detailing the origin of the selfing species, Capsella rubella,\nwhich recently split from its outcrossing sister, Capsella grandiflora. Due to\nthe recency of the split, most variation within C. rubella is found within C.\ngrandiflora. We can therefore identify genomic regions where two C. rubella\nindividuals have inherited the same or different segments of ancestral\ndiversity (i.e. founding haplotypes) present in C. rubella's founder(s). Based\non this analysis, we show that C. rubella was founded by multiple individuals\ndrawn from a diverse ancestral population closely related to extant C.\ngrandiflora, that drift and selection have rapidly homogenized most of this\nancestral variation since C. rubella's founding, and that little novel\nvariation has accumulated within this time. Despite the extensive loss of\nancestral variation, the approximately 25% of the genome for which two C.\nrubella individuals have inherited different founding haplotypes makes up\nroughly 90% of the genetic variation between them. To extend these findings, we\ndevelop a coalescent model that utilizes the inferred frequency of founding\nhaplotypes and variation within founding haplotypes to estimate that C. rubella\nwas founded by a potentially large number of individuals 50-100 kya, and has\nsubsequently experienced a 20X reduction in its effective population size.

The mixed-norm\nregularization based on the l1q norm with q>1 is attractive in many\napplications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group\nsparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,\nchallenging to solve due to the inherent structure of the mixed-norm\nregularization. Existing work deals with special cases with q=1, 2, infinity,\nand they cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we\npropose an efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for\nsolving the general l1q-regularized problem. One key building block of the\nproposed algorithm is the l1q-regularized Euclidean projection (EP_1q). Our\ntheoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP_1q and illustrates why\nEP_1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the\nspecial cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient\nalgorithm for EP_1q by solving two zero finding problems. To further improve\nthe efficiency of solving large dimensional mixed-norm regularized problems, we\npropose a screening method which is able to quickly identify the inactive\ngroups, i.e., groups that have 0 components in the solution. This may lead to\nsubstantial reduction in the number of groups to be entered to the\noptimization. An appealing feature of our screening method is that the data set\nneeds to be scanned only once to run the screening. Compared to that of solving\nthe mixed-norm regularized problems, the computational cost of our screening\ntest is negligible. The key of the proposed screening method is an accurate\nsensitivity analysis of the dual optimal solution when the regularization\nparameter varies.

Given a set of weighted polygons in the\n2-dimensional plane, the goal is to find a set of pairwise non-overlapping\npolygons with maximum total weight. Due to its wide range of applications, the\nMWISP problem and its special cases have been extensively studied both in the\napproximation algorithms and the computational geometry community. Despite a\nlot of research, its general case is not well-understood. Currently the best\nknown polynomial time algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of n^(epsilon)\n[Fox and Pach, SODA 2011], and it is not even clear whether the problem is\nAPX-hard. We present a (1+epsilon)-approximation algorithm, assuming that each\npolygon in the input has at most a polylogarithmic number of vertices. Our\nalgorithm has quasi-polynomial running time.\n  We use a recently introduced framework for approximating maximum weight\nindependent set in geometric intersection graphs. The framework has been used\nto construct a QPTAS in the much simpler case of axis-parallel rectangles. We\nextend it in two ways, to adapt it to our much more general setting. First, we\nshow that its technical core can be reduced to the case when all input polygons\nare triangles. Secondly, we replace its key technical ingredient which is a\nmethod to partition the plane using only few edges such that the objects\nstemming from the optimal solution are evenly distributed among the resulting\nfaces and each object is intersected only a few times. Our new procedure for\nthis task is not more complex than the original one, and it can handle the\narising difficulties due to the arbitrary angles of the polygons.
