The\nproposed FSG employs a new hierarchical distance learning strategy to minimize\nthe error difference. For this purpose, we first construct an ensemble of\nbase-layer fuzzy k- Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers, each of which receives\na different feature set extracted from the same sample set. The fuzzy\nmembership values computed at the decision space of each fuzzy k-NN classifier\nare concatenated to form the feature vectors of a fusion space. Finally, the\nfeature vectors are fed to a meta-layer classifier to learn the degree of\naccuracy of the decisions of the base-layer classifiers for meta-layer\nclassification. Rather than the power of the individual base layer-classifiers,\ndiversity and cooperation of the classifiers become an important issue to\nimprove the overall performance of the proposed FSG. A weak base-layer\nclassifier may boost the overall performance more than a strong classifier, if\nit is capable of recognizing the samples, which are not recognized by the rest\nof the classifiers, in its own feature space. The experiments explore the type\nof the collaboration among the individual classifiers required for an improved\nperformance of the suggested architecture.

To achieve in simulations access to length-scales and\ntime-scales difficult to attain in fully atomistic molecular dynamics, these\ncoarse-grained models provide a reduced description of the molecular degrees of\nfreedom and often remove entirely representation of the solvent degrees of\nfreedom. In such implicit-solvent models the solvent contributions are treated\nthrough effective interaction terms within an effective potential for the free\nenergy.

In this work we establish the theoretical\nbasis for a particle physics-motivated model (Bound Dark Matter, BDM) which\nexplain the need of extra radiation. The BDM model describes dark matter\nparticles which are relativistic at a scale below a < ac, these particles\nacquire mass with an initial velocity, vc, at scales a > ac due to\nnon-perturbative methods, as protons and neutrons do, this process is described\nby a time dependent equation of state, w_bdm(a). Owing to this behavior the\namount of extra radiation change as a function of the scale factor, this entail\nthat the extra relativistic degrees of freedom Nex may also vary as a function\nof the scale factor. This is favored by data at CMB and BBN epochs. We compute\nthe range of values of the BDM model parameters, xc = ac*vc, that explain the\nvalues obtained for the 4He at BBN and Neff at equality. Combining different\nanalysis we compute the value xc = 4.13x10^{-5} and vc = 0.37.

The dynamics of a\nskyrmion is equivalent to an electron moving in a strong magnetic field. As a\nskyrmion involves large number of spins, it is not clear whether there exist\nobservable quantum effects. In this work, we study the quantum dynamics of a\nskyrmion in a pinning potential. Without a pinning potential, the skyrmion\nperforms cyclotron motion due to the strong emergent magnetic field originating\nfrom the Berry phase of spins, and all skyrmions occupy the lowest Landau\nlevel. Their wave functions are strongly localized in a region with radius less\nthan $1\\ \\AA$ when no driving force is applied. Thus in most circumstances, the\nquantum effects of a skyrmion are weak. In the presence of a pinning potential,\nthe lowest Landau level for skyrmions is split into quantized levels,\ncharacterized by the orbital moments. The transition between quantized levels\ncan be observed experimentally by microwave absorption measurements in low\ntemperature region. The quantum effects are more prominent for a skyrmion with\na small size, which can be realized in magnets with a large\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.\n","Comment: 4.2 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The aim is to understand how the\nscale function should be used for estimation of the univariate component. It is\nknown that the scale function does not affect the rate of the MISE convergence,\nand as a result sharp constants are explored. The paper begins with developing\na sharp-minimax theory for a pivotal model\n$Y=f(X)+\\sigma(X,\\mathbf{Z})\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ is standard\nnormal and independent of the predictor X and the auxiliary vector-covariate\n$\\mathbf{Z}$.

This is an interesting conclusion because if the scale does not depend\non the auxiliary covariate $\\mathbf{Z}$, then ignoring the heteroscedasticity\ncan yield a sharp minimax estimation. The pivotal model serves as a natural\nbenchmark for a general additive model\n$Y=f(X)+g(\\mathbf{Z})+\\sigma(X,\\mathbf{Z})\\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon$ may\ndepend on $(X,\\mathbf{Z})$ and have only a finite fourth moment.

We indicate how robots could be scheduled optimally to satisfy any\narrival rate in the capacity region, given prior knowledge about arrival rates.\nWe find that if the number of robots allocated grows proportionally with the\nnumber of source-sink pairs, then the capacity of the network scales as\n$\\Theta(1)$, similar to what was shown previously by Grossglauser and Tse for\nuncontrolled mobility; however, in contrast to that prior result, we also find\nthat with controlled mobility this constant capacity scaling can be obtained\nwhile ensuring finite delay.

In CBMF, the robots are matched to sources and sinks\nonce every epoch to maximize a queue-differential-based weight. The matching\ncontrols both motion and transmission for each robot: if a robot is matched to\na source, it moves towards that source and collects data from it; and if it is\nmatched to a sink, it moves towards that sink and transmits data to it.
