Finding\nsuch a graph involves solving a special case of the classical Ramsey arrowing\noperation. Folkman proved the existence of these graphs in 1970, and they are\nnow called Folkman graphs. Erd\\H{o}s offered \\$100 for deciding if one exists\nwith less than $10^{10}$ vertices. This problem remained open until 1988 when\nSpencer, in a seminal paper using probabilistic techniques, proved the\nexistence of a Folkman graph of order $3\\times 10^9$ (after an erratum),\nwithout explicitly constructing it. In 2008, Dudek and R\\\"{o}dl developed a\nstrategy to construct new Folkman graphs by approximating the maximum cut of a\nrelated graph, and used it to improve the upper bound to 941. We improve this\nbound first to 860 using their approximation technique and then further to 786\nwith the MAX-CUT semidefinite programming relaxation as used in the\nGoemans-Williamson algorithm.\n"]}]

The represented stimuli, however, vary substantially among\ndifferent sensory modalities and different neurons. The goal of this paper is\nto determine which kind of stimulus features can be encoded in burst length,\nand how those features depend on the mathematical properties of the underlying\ndynamical system. We show that the initiation and termination of each burst is\ntriggered by specific stimulus features whose temporal characteristsics are\ndetermined by the types of bifurcations that initiate and terminate firing in\neach burst. As only a few bifurcations are possible, only a restricted number\nof encoded features exists. Here we focus specifically on describing parabolic,\nsquare-wave and elliptic bursters. We find that parabolic bursters, whose\nfiring is initiated and terminated by saddle-node bifurcations, behave as\nprototypical integrators: Firing is triggered by depolarizing stimuli, and\nlasts for as long as excitation is prolonged. Elliptic bursters, contrastingly,\nconstitute prototypical resonators, since both the initiating and terminating\nbifurcations possess well-defined oscillation time scales. Firing is therefore\ntriggered by stimulus stretches of matching frequency and terminated by a\nphase-inversion in the oscillation. The behavior of square-wave bursters is\nsomewhat intermediate, since they are triggered by a fold bifurcation of cycles\nof well-defined frequency but are terminated by a homoclinic bifurcation\nlacking an oscillating time scale.
