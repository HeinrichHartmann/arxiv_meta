The\nscale, resource limitations, and new threats such as node capture necessitate\nthe use of an on-line key generation by the nodes themselves. However, the cost\nof such schemes is high since their secrecy is based on computational\ncomplexity. Recently, several research contributions justified that the\nwireless channel itself can be used to generate information-theoretic secure\nkeys. By exchanging sampling messages during movement, a bit string can be\nderived that is only known to the involved entities. Yet, movement is not the\nonly possibility to generate randomness. The channel response is also strongly\ndependent on the frequency of the transmitted signal. In our work, we introduce\na protocol for key generation based on the frequency-selectivity of channel\nfading. The practical advantage of this approach is that we do not require node\nmovement. Thus, the frequent case of a sensor network with static motes is\nsupported. Furthermore, the error correction property of the protocol mitigates\nthe effects of measurement errors and other temporal effects, giving rise to an\nagreement rate of over 97%.

To this end, we perform 3D general-relativistic\nsimulations with a 3-species neutrino leakage scheme. The leakage scheme\ncaptures the essential aspects of neutrino cooling, heating, and lepton number\nexchange as predicted by radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. The 27-solar-mass\nprogenitor was studied in 2D by B. Mueller et al. (ApJ 761:72, 2012), who\nobserved strong growth of the SASI while neutrino-driven convection was\nsuppressed. In our 3D simulations, neutrino-driven convection grows from\nnumerical perturbations imposed by our Cartesian grid. It becomes the dominant\ninstability and leads to large-scale non-oscillatory deformations of the shock\nfront. These will result in strongly aspherical explosions without the need for\nlarge-scale SASI shock oscillations. Low-l-mode SASI oscillations are present\nin our models, but saturate at small amplitudes that decrease with increasing\nneutrino heating and vigor of convection. Our results, in agreement with\nsimpler 3D Newtonian simulations, suggest that once neutrino-driven convection\nis started, it is likely to become the dominant instability in 3D.

The results are split between three chapters. For the\nfirst results, we set-up the basic framework for working with quantum fields\nconfined to cavities. By considering the real Klein-Gordon field, we describe\nhow to model the non-uniform motion of a rigid cavity through spacetime.

The second set of results investigate how the Dirac\nfield can be confined to a cavity for quantum information purposes.

It\nis shown that different types of Dirac field states are more robust against\nmotion than others. The final results look at using our second notion of\nlocalisation, Unruh- DeWitt detectors. We investigate how allowing for a\n\"non-point-like\" spatial profile of the Unruh-DeWitt detector affects how it\ninteracts with a quantum field around it.

We\nshow that $d_T$ has monotonicity properties which make it compatible with the\nlinear structure. We also prove several convexity properties of $d_T$ and some\nresults concerning the topology of $d_T$, including a brief study of the\n$d_T$-convergence of monotone sequences. It is shown most of the results are\ntrue without any assumption of an Archimedean-type property for $K$. One\nconsiders various completeness properties and one studies the relations between\nthem. Since $d_T$ is defined in the context of a generic ordered linear space,\nwith no need of an underlying topological structure, one expects to express its\ncompleteness in terms of properties of the ordering, with respect to the linear\nstructure. This is done in this paper and, to the best of our knowledge, this\nhas not been done yet. The Thompson metric $d_T$ and order-unit (semi)norms\n$|\\cdot|_u$ are strongly related and share important properties, as both are\ndefined in terms of the ordered linear structure. Although $d_T$ and\n$|\\cdot|_u$ are only topological (and not metrical) equivalent on $K_u$, we\nprove that the completeness is a common feature. One proves the completeness of\nthe Thompson metric on a sequentially complete normal cone in a locally convex\nspace. At the end of the paper, it is shown that, in the case of a Banach\nspace, the normality of the cone is also necessary for the completeness of the\nThompson metric.\n","Comment: 36 pages"]}]

However, when we\nhave learned to recognize a foreign accent, it seems plausible that recognition\nof a word rarely involves reconstruction of the speech gestures of the speaker\nrather than the listener. To better assess the motor theory and this\nobservation, we proceed in three stages. Part 1 places the motor theory of\nspeech perception in a larger framework based on our earlier models of the\nadaptive formation of mirror neurons for grasping, and for viewing extensions\nof that mirror system as part of a larger system for neuro-linguistic\nprocessing, augmented by the present consideration of recognizing speech in a\nnovel accent. Part 2 then offers a novel computational model of how a listener\ncomes to understand the speech of someone speaking the listener's native\nlanguage with a foreign accent. The core tenet of the model is that the\nlistener uses hypotheses about the word the speaker is currently uttering to\nupdate probabilities linking the sound produced by the speaker to phonemes in\nthe native language repertoire of the listener. This, on average, improves the\nrecognition of later words. This model is neutral regarding the nature of the\nrepresentations it uses (motor vs. auditory). It serve as a reference point for\nthe discussion in Part 3, which proposes a dual-stream neuro-linguistic\narchitecture to revisits claims for and against the motor theory of speech\nperception and the relevance of mirror neurons, and extracts some implications\nfor the reframing of the motor theory.\n"]}]

A planar prewetting transition is known to be a\ndistinctly first-order phenomenon, and typically taking place on the scale of\nseveral atomic diameters. A continuous prewetting transition, on the other\nhand, is scale invariant. Thus, apart from being of fundamental significance,\nthis finding has potential for facilitating experimental detection as well as\nmeasurements of planar prewetting. Further, we provide proof for the existence\nof a tri-critical point of the three-phase coexistence line of the capped\ncapillary while by considering a dynamic model of wetting we show how the\nrelaxation of the system can be pinned by a metastable state.

We find\nthat the CRSF has a very smooth and symmetric shape, in all observations and at\nall pulse-phases. We compare the residuals of a line with a Gaussian optical\ndepth profile to a Lorentzian optical depth profile and find no significant\ndifferences, strongly constraining the very smooth shape of the line. Even\nthough the line energy changes dramatically with pulse phase, we find that its\nsmooth shape does not. Additionally, our data show that the continuum is only\nchanging marginally between the three observations. These changes can be\nexplained with varying amounts of Thomson scattering in the hot corona of the\naccretion disk.
