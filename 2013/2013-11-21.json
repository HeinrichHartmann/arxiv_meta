The variability at 2.8 cm leads by about 1 day the variability at 6\ncm and 11 cm.

Large and\nquasi-sinusoidal variations of ~ 0.8 mag were detected in the V, R and I-bands.\nThe X-ray data (0.2-10 keV) do not reveal significant variability on a 4 day\ntime scale, favoring reprocessed inverse-Compton over synchrotron radiation in\nthis band. The characteristic variability time scales in radio and optical\nbands are similar. A quasi-periodic variation (QPO) of 0.9 - 1.1 days in the\noptical data may be present, but if so it is marginal and limited to 2.2\ncycles.

The lack of\na strong radio-optical correlation indicates different physical causes of\nvariability (ISS at long radio wavelengths, source intrinsic origin in the\noptical), and is consistent with a high jet opacity and a compact synchrotron\ncomponent peaking at ~= 100 GHz in an ongoing very prominent flux density\noutburst.

The features are masked by Gaussian noise\nwith mean zero and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$, where the precision matrix\n$\\Omega=\\Sigma^{-1}$ is unknown but is presumably sparse. The useful features,\nalso unknown, are sparse and each contributes weakly (i.e., rare and weak) to\nthe classification decision. By obtaining a reasonably good estimate of\n$\\Omega$, we formulate the setting as a linear regression model. We propose a\ntwo-stage classification method where we first select features by the method of\nInnovated Thresholding (IT), and then use the retained features and Fisher's\nLDA for classification. In this approach, a crucial problem is how to set the\nthreshold of IT. We approach this problem by adapting the recent innovation of\nHigher Criticism Thresholding (HCT). We find that when useful features are rare\nand weak, the limiting behavior of HCT is essentially just as good as the\nlimiting behavior of ideal threshold, the threshold one would choose if the\nunderlying distribution of the signals is known (if only). Somewhat\nsurprisingly, when $\\Omega$ is sufficiently sparse, its off-diagonal\ncoordinates usually do not have a major influence over the classification\ndecision.

We discuss the idea of using the\nMAC-E-Filter in a time-of-flight mode (MAC-E-TOF) in which the neutrino mass is\ndetermined by a measurement of the electron time-of-flight (TOF) spectrum that\ndepends on the neutrino mass. MAC-E-TOF spectroscopy here is a very sensitive\nmethod since the $\\beta$-electrons are slowed down to distinguishable\nvelocities by the MAC-E-Filter. Their velocity depends strongly on their\nsurplus energy above the electric retarding potential. Using MAC-E-TOF, a\nstatistical sensitivity gain is expected. Because a small number of\nretarding-potential settings is sufficient for a complete measurement, in\ncontrast to about 40 different retarding potentials used in the standard\nMAC-E-Filter mode, there is a gain in measurement time and hence statistical\npower.

In the past, the image\nscale of the SST has been determined by measuring the distance between the\nmoons of Jupiter in a captured SST image and comparing it to reference values,\nas well as with the Venus transit of 2004.

In our\nmodel, agents change behaviors/opinions on the basis of information collected\nfrom their neighbors in a time interval of bounded size whereas agents are\nassumed to have unbounded memory in previously studied scenarios. In our\nmathematical framework, one is given a network $G=(V,E)$, an integer value\n$t(v)$ for each node $v\\in V$, and a time window size $\\lambda$. The goal is to\ndetermine a small set of nodes (target set) that influences the whole graph.\nThe spread of influence proceeds in rounds as follows: initially all nodes in\nthe target set are influenced; subsequently, in each round, any uninfluenced\nnode $v$ becomes influenced if the number of its neighbors that have been\ninfluenced in the previous $\\lambda$ rounds is greater than or equal to $t(v)$.\nWe prove that the problem of finding a minimum cardinality target set that\ninfluences the whole network $G$ is hard to approximate within a\npolylogarithmic factor.

The\nproposed method quantifies such relations based on multiple text observations.\nSuch observations provide distance and orientation features which are utilized\nby a greedy Expectation Maximization-based (EM) algorithm to infer a\nprobability distribution over predefined spatial relationships; the latter\nrepresent the quantified relationships under user-defined probabilistic\nassumptions. We evaluate the applicability and quality of the proposed approach\nusing real UGC data originating from an actual travel blog text corpus.
