The variability at 2.8 cm leads by about 1 day the variability at 6\ncm and 11 cm.

Large and\nquasi-sinusoidal variations of ~ 0.8 mag were detected in the V, R and I-bands.\nThe X-ray data (0.2-10 keV) do not reveal significant variability on a 4 day\ntime scale, favoring reprocessed inverse-Compton over synchrotron radiation in\nthis band. The characteristic variability time scales in radio and optical\nbands are similar. A quasi-periodic variation (QPO) of 0.9 - 1.1 days in the\noptical data may be present, but if so it is marginal and limited to 2.2\ncycles.

The lack of\na strong radio-optical correlation indicates different physical causes of\nvariability (ISS at long radio wavelengths, source intrinsic origin in the\noptical), and is consistent with a high jet opacity and a compact synchrotron\ncomponent peaking at ~= 100 GHz in an ongoing very prominent flux density\noutburst.

The features are masked by Gaussian noise\nwith mean zero and covariance matrix $\\Sigma$, where the precision matrix\n$\\Omega=\\Sigma^{-1}$ is unknown but is presumably sparse. The useful features,\nalso unknown, are sparse and each contributes weakly (i.e., rare and weak) to\nthe classification decision.

We propose a\ntwo-stage classification method where we first select features by the method of\nInnovated Thresholding (IT), and then use the retained features and Fisher's\nLDA for classification. In this approach, a crucial problem is how to set the\nthreshold of IT. We approach this problem by adapting the recent innovation of\nHigher Criticism Thresholding (HCT). We find that when useful features are rare\nand weak, the limiting behavior of HCT is essentially just as good as the\nlimiting behavior of ideal threshold, the threshold one would choose if the\nunderlying distribution of the signals is known (if only). Somewhat\nsurprisingly, when $\\Omega$ is sufficiently sparse, its off-diagonal\ncoordinates usually do not have a major influence over the classification\ndecision.

Our generator framework DEViL3D\nsupports the design and implementation of visual 3D languages for such modeling\npurposes. The front-end of a language implementation generated by DEViL3D is a\ndedicated 3D graphical structure editor, which is used to construct programs in\nthat domain. DEViL3D supports the language designer to describe the visual\nappearance of the constructs of the particular language in terms of generic 3D\ndepictions. Their parameters specify where substructures are embedded, and how\nthe graphic adapts to space requirements of nested constructs. The 3D editor\nused for such specifications is generated by DEViL3D, too. In this paper, we\nbriefly introduce the research field of 3D visual languages and report about\nour generator framework and the role that generic depictions play in the\nspecification process for 3D languages. Our results show that our approach is\nsuitable for a wide range of 3D languages. We emphasize this suitability by\npresenting requirements on the visual appearance for different languages.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures, extended version of conference paper\n  \"Specifying Generic Depictions of Language Constructs for 3D Visual\n  Languages\", which I presented at the VL/HCC 2013:\n  http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VLHCC.2013.6645258"]}]

Other telescopes, such as NASA's Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO)utilize their larger Field of View (FOV) to use the solar disk\nas a reference in order to measure the image scale. In the past, the image\nscale of the SST has been determined by measuring the distance between the\nmoons of Jupiter in a captured SST image and comparing it to reference values,\nas well as with the Venus transit of 2004. Both of these methods have their\ndrawbacks, including needing to open the telescope at night or waiting for the\nvery rare occurrence of a solar transit, which the telescope may not even be in\na position to observe.
