Inflation traces back all the inhomogeneities to quantum fluctuations\nalthough the structures look classical today. Squeezing of primordial quantum\nfluctuations along with the mechanism of decoherence accounts for many aspects\nof this quantum to classical transition, although it remains a matter of debate\nas to whether this is sufficient to explain the issue of realization of a\nsingle outcome (i.e. the issue of macro-objectification) from a quantum\nensemble given that the universe is a closed system. A similar question of\nemergence of classical behavior of macroscopic objects exists also for\nlaboratory systems and apart from decoherence there have been attempts to\nresolve this issue through Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL), which is\na stochastic nonlinear modification of the non-relativistic Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation.

Inspired by experimental results, we\nhere study the effects of these competing processes by kinetic Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a simple lattice-gas model. In order to untangle the various\neffects, we perform large-scale simulations, in which we monitor coverage,\ncorrelation length, and cluster-size distributions, as well as the behavior of\nrepresentative individual clusters, during desorption. For each initial\nadsorbate configuration, we perform multiple, independent simulations, without\nand with diffusion, respectively. We find that, compared to desorption without\ndiffusion, the coverage-conserving diffusion process produces two competing\neffects: a retardation of the desorption rate, which is associated with a\ncoarsening of the adsorbate configuration, and an acceleration due to\ndesorption of monomers \"evaporated\" from the cluster perimeters. The balance\nbetween these two effects is governed by the structure of the adsorbate layer\nat the beginning of the desorption process.

This unique spin splitting distincts from the well-known Zeeman-type\nspin splitting and the Rashba-type spin splitting. Our analysis indicates that\nthe competition between quantum spin Hall edge states and valley edge states in\nthe nanoribbon leads to the unique spin splitting. The quantum spin Hall states\nat one edge of the nanoribbon are suppressed by the counterpropagating edge\nmodes induced by the pseudomagnetic field. At the opposite edge, the quantum\nspin Hall states are not affected at all. Therefore, the degenerate quantum\nspin Hall states of opposite spin orientation, which propagate at the two\nopposite edges of the nanoribbon, are lifted.

There are two principle\ntypes of MCS, one is the Rigid Multiple Camera System (RMCS); the other is the\nArticulated Camera System (ACS). In a RMCS, the relative poses (relative 3-D\nposition and orientation) between the cameras are invariant. While, in an ACS,\nthe cameras are articulated through movable joints, the relative pose between\nthem may change. Therefore, through calibration of an ACS we want to find not\nonly the relative poses between the cameras but also the positions of the\njoints in the ACS.\n  In this paper, we developed calibration algorithms for the ACS using a simple\nconstraint: the joint is fixed relative to the cameras connected with it during\nthe transformations of the ACS. When the transformations of the cameras in an\nACS can be estimated relative to the same coordinate system, the positions of\nthe joints in the ACS can be calculated by solving linear equations. However,\nin a non-overlapping view ACS, only the ego-transformations of the cameras and\ncan be estimated. We proposed a two-steps method to deal with this problem. In\nboth methods, the ACS is assumed to have performed general transformations in a\nstatic environment. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed methods are\ntested by simulation and real experiments. In the real experiment, the\nintrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the ACS are obtained simultaneously by\nour calibration procedure using the same image sequences, no extra data\ncapturing step is required. The corresponding trajectory is recovered and\nillustrated using the calibration results of the ACS. Since the estimated\ntranslations of different cameras in an ACS may scaled by different scale\nfactors, a scale factor estimation algorithm is also proposed. To our\nknowledge, we are the first to study the calibration of ACS.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 15 figures"]}]
