In the case of general 3-dimensional compact manifolds, after a\n$TT^*$ argument, simply by using the $L^2$-boundedness of the Hilbert transform\non $\\R$, we are able to improve the corresponding $L^2$-restriction bounds of\nBurq, G\\'erard and Tzvetkov and Hu. Also, in the case of 2-dimensional compact\nmanifolds with nonpositive curvature, we obtain improved $L^4$-estimates for\nrestrictions to geodesics, which, by H\\\"older's inequality and interpolation,\nimplies improved $L^p$-bounds for all exponents $p\\ge 2$. We do this by using\noscillatory integral theorems of H\\\"ormander, Greenleaf and Seeger, and Phong\nand Stein, along with a simple geometric lemma (Lemma \\ref{lemma3.2}) about\nproperties of the mixed-Hessian of the Riemannian distance function restricted\nto pairs of geodesics in Riemannian surfaces. We are also able to get further\nimprovements beyond our new results in three dimensions under the assumption of\nconstant nonpositive curvature by exploiting the fact that in this case there\nare many totally geodesic submanifolds.\n","Comment: 24 pages.

However,\nprogressing target erosion during sputtering results in increased magnetic\nfield strengths at the target surface. Consequently, the glow discharge, the\ntarget poisoning, and hence the morphology, crystal structure and stoichiometry\nof the prepared thin films are influenced. Therefore, these effects were\ninvestigated by varying the cathode current Im between 0.50 and 1.00 A, the\nmagnetic field strength B between 45 and 90 mT, and the O2/(Ar+O2) flow rate\nratio between 0 and 100%. With increasing oxygen flow ratio a\nsub-stoichiometric TaOx oxide forms at the metallic Ta target surface which\nfurther transfers to a non-conductive tantalum pentoxide Ta2O5, impeding a\nstable DC glow discharge. These two transition zones (from Ta to TaOx and from\nTaOx to Ta2O5) shift to higher oxygen flow rates for increasing target\ncurrents. Contrary, increasing the magnetic field strength (e.g., due to\nsputter erosion) mainly shifts the TaOx to Ta2O5 transition to lower oxygen\nflow rates while marginally influencing the Ta to TaOx transition. To allow for\na stable DC glow discharge (and to suppress the formation of non-conductive\nTa2O5 at the target) even at a flow rate ratio of 100% either a high target\ncurrent (Im >= 1 A) or a low magnetic field strength (B <= 60 mT) is necessary.\nThese conditions are required to prepare stoichiometric and fully crystalline\nTa2O5 films.

The objects are macroscopic atomic ensembles at room\ntemperature. Entanglement required for teleportation is distributed by light\npropagating from one ensemble to the other. Quantum states encoded in a\ncollective spin state of one ensemble are teleported onto another ensemble\nusing this entanglement and homodyne measurements on light. By implementing\nprocess tomography, we demonstrate that the experimental fidelity of the\nquantum teleportation is higher than that achievable by any classical process.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of deterministic teleportation by\nteleporting a dynamically changing sequence of spin states from one distant\nobject onto another.\n"]}]

We\npropose that the different behaviors observed during the interactions may\ncaused by different speed gradients at the boundaries of the two active\nregions. For the origin of the EUV wave, we find that it formed ahead of a\ngroup of expanding loops a few minutes after the start of the loops' expansion,\nwhich represents the initiation of the associated coronal mass ejection (CME).\nBased on these results, we conclude that the EUV wave should be a nonlinear\nmagnetosonic wave or shock driven by the associated CME, which propagated\nfaster than the ambient fast-mode speed and gradually slowed down to an\nordinary linear wave. Our observations support the hybrid model that includes\nboth fast wave and slow non-wave components.\n","Comment: It has been published by APJL,\n  http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/773/2/L33/"]}]

As secondary magnetic islands appear, the highest temperature is not\nalways found at the reconnection $X$-points, but also inside the secondary\nislands. One of the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction is to decrease\nthe temperature of the reconnecting $X-$points and transfer the heat into the\n$O-$points, the plasmoids, where it gets trapped. In the cases with\ntemperature-dependent magnetic diffusivity, $\\eta \\sim T^{-3/2}$, the decrease\nin plasma temperature at the $X-$points leads to: (i) increase in the magnetic\ndiffusivity until the characteristic time for magnetic diffusion becomes\ncomparable to that of thermal conduction; (ii) increase in the reconnection\nrate; and, (iii) more efficient conversion of magnetic energy into thermal\nenergy and kinetic energy of bulk motions.

LOPES data and CoREAS simulations can then be treated\nequally and the same analysis software can be applied to both. This gives the\nopportunity to compare data and simulations directly. Furthermore, the standard\nanalysis software can be used with simulations which provide the possibility to\ncheck the accuracy regarding reconstruction of air shower parameters. We point\nout the advantages and present first results using such a full LOPES detector\nsimulation.

The case of anomalous dispersion is indeed the most\ninteresting from the theoretical point of view, because of the considerable\nvariety of dynamical behaviors that can be observed.
