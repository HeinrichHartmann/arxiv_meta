In particular, we focus on two\ndifferent strategies by which the ternary electrolytes can be devised, namely\nby (a) adding the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI, and (b) substituting the PEO\nchains in PEO20LiTFSI by the ionic liquid. In order to grasp the changes of the\noverall lithium transport mechanism, we employ an analytical, Rouse-based\ncation transport model (Maitra et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 98, 227802),\nwhich has originally been devised for binary PEO-based electrolytes. This model\ndistinguishes three different microscopic transport mechanisms, each quantified\nby an individual time scale. In the course of our analysis, we extend this\nmathematical description to account for an entirely new transport mechanism,\nnamely the TFSI-supported diffusion of lithium ions decoupled from the PEO\nchains, which emerges for certain stoichiometries. We find that the segmental\nmobility plays a decisive role in PEO-based polymer electrolytes. That is,\nwhereas the addition of the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI plasticizes the polymer\nnetwork and thus also increases the lithium diffusion, the amount of free,\nmobile ether oxygens reduces when substituting the PEO chains by the ionic\nliquid, which compensates the plasticizing effect. In total, our observations\nallow us to formulate some general principles about the lithium ion transport\nmechanism in ternary polymer electrolytes. Moreover, our insights also shed\nlight on recent experimental observations (Joost et al., Electrochim. Acta,\n2012, 86, 330).\n","Comment: 19 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables"]}]

Stationary propagation of the front is\naccompanied by formation of a non-stationary oscillatory tail with complicated\ninternal structure. We demonstrate that the structure of the oscillatory tail\nis related to a relationship between phase and group velocities of the\noscillations.

The research herein explores how the tensile\ndeformation of amorphous polyethylene, modelled with a united atom method\npotential, is influenced by heat and pressure dissipation. The stress-strain\ncurves for the pressure dissipation cases (uniaxial tension) are in qualitative\nagreement with experiments and show that heat dissipation has a large effect on\nthe strain hardening modulus calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. The\nevolution of the energy associated with bonded and non-bonded terms was\nquantified as a function of strain as well as the evolution of stress in both\nthe loading and non-loading directions to give insight into how the stress\nstate is altered within the elastic, yield, strain softening, and strain\nhardening regions. The stress partitioning shows a competition between\n`tensile' Van der Waal's interactions and `compressive' bond stretching forces,\nwith the characteristic yield stress peak clearly associated with the\nnon-bonded stress. The lack of heat dissipation had the largest effect on the\nstrain hardening regime, where an increase in the calculated temperature\ncorrelated with faster chain alignment in the loading direction and more rapid\nconformation changes. In part, these observations demonstrate the role that\nheat and pressure dissipation play on deformation characteristics of amorphous\npolymers, particularly for the strain hardening regime.\n"]}]

The\nmicroscopic dynamics is given by a chain of anharmonic oscillators subject to a\nvarying tension (external force) and the contact with the heat bath is modeled\nby independent Langevin dynamics acting on each particle. After a diffusive\nspace-time scaling and cross-graining, the profile of volume converges to the\nsolution of a deterministic diffusive equation with boundary conditions given\nby the applied tension. This defines an irreversible thermodynamic\ntransformation from an initial equilibrium to a new equilibrium given by the\nfinal tension applied. Quasi static reversible isothermal transformations are\nthen obtained by a further time scaling. Heat is defined as the total flux of\nenergy exchanged between the system and the heat bath. Then we prove that the\nrelation between the limit heat, work, free energy and thermodynamic entropy\nagree with the first and second principle of thermodynamics.\n"]}]

Production of such beams requires\nsending a short, high intensity proton pulse to the pion production target,\ncapturing pions and collecting the resulting muons in the large acceptance\ntransport system. The substantial increase of beam quality can be obtained by\napplying the RF phase rotation on the muon beam in the dedicated FFAG ring,\nwhich was proposed for the PRISM project.This allows to reduce the momentum\nspread of the beam and to purify from the unwanted components like pions or\nsecondary protons. A PRISM Task Force is addressing the accelerator and\ndetector issues that need to be solved in order to realize the PRISM\nexperiment. The parameters of the required proton beam, the principles of the\nPRISM experiment and the baseline FFAG design are introduced.
