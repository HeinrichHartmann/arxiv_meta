In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.\nEach cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a\nfunction of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.\nWith each such \"X-factor\" we associate a market information process, the values\nof which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of\ntwo terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;\nthe other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent\nBrownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the\naggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is\ngiven by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral\nmeasure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When\nthe cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit\nmodel is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on\ndividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the\nprice of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The\ninformation-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin\nof stochastic volatility.\n","Comment: 32 pages. No figure"]}]

This property\ncan be used to generate certified randomness in a device-independent way, i.e.,\nwithout making detailed assumptions about the internal working of the quantum\ndevices used to generate the random numbers. Furthermore these numbers are also\nprivate, i.e., they appear random not only to the user, but also to any\nadversary that might possess a perfect description of the devices. Since this\nprocess requires a small initial random seed, one usually speaks of\ndevice-independent randomness expansion.\n  The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we point out that in most real,\npractical situations, where the concept of device-independence is used as a\nprotection against unintentional flaws or failures of the quantum apparatuses,\nit is sufficient to show that the generated string is random with respect to an\nadversary that holds only classical-side information, i.e., proving randomness\nagainst quantum-side information is not necessary. Furthermore, the initial\nrandom seed does not need to be private with respect to the adversary, provided\nthat it is generated in a way that is independent from the measured systems.\nThe devices, though, will generate cryptographically-secure randomness that\ncannot be predicted by the adversary and thus one can, given access to free\npublic randomness, talk about private randomness generation.\n  The theoretical tools to quantify the generated randomness according to these\ncriteria were already introduced in [S. Pironio et al, Nature 464, 1021\n(2010)], but the final results were improperly formulated.

Empirical research in both human and nonhuman animals\nreveals that individuals often attend to the foraging choices of their\ncompetitors while making their own foraging choices. Due to the complications\nof gathering field data or constructing experiments, however, broad facts\nrelating theoretically optimal and empirically realized foraging choices are\nonly now emerging. Here, we analyze foraging choices of a cohort of\nprofessional day traders who must choose between trading the same stock\nmultiple times in a row---patch exploitation---or switching to a different\nstock---patch exploration---with potentially higher returns. We measure the\ndifference between a trader's resource intake and the competitors' expected\nintake within a short period of time---a difference we call short-term\ncomparative returns. We find that traders' choices can be explained by foraging\nheuristics that maximize their daily short-term comparative returns. However,\nwe find no one-best relationship between different trading choices and net\nincome intake. This suggests that traders' choices can be short-term win\noriented and, paradoxically, maybe maladaptive for absolute market returns.\n"]}]

The\nquestion of how these paths are identified is related to the fundamental\nproblem of topology discovery. Distributed algorithms for topology discovery\ncope with a never ending task, dealing with frequent changes in the network\ntopology and unpredictable transient faults. Therefore, algorithms for topology\ndiscovery should be self-stabilizing to ensure convergence of the topology\ninformation following any such unpredictable sequence of events. We present the\nfirst such algorithm that can cope with Byzantine nodes. Starting in an\narbitrary global state, and in the presence of f Byzantine nodes, each node is\neventually aware of all the other non-Byzantine nodes and their connecting\ncommunication links. Using the topology information, nodes can, for example,\nroute messages across the network and deliver messages from one end user to\nanother.

We also consider the task of r-neighborhood\ndiscovery for the case in which r and the degree of nodes are bounded by\nconstants. The use of r-neighborhood discovery facilitates polynomial time,\ncommunication and space solutions for the above tasks. The obtained algorithms\ncan be used to authenticate parties, in particular during the establishment of\nprivate secrets, thus forming public key schemes that are resistant to\nman-in-the-middle attacks of the compromised Byzantine nodes.

Slipher had singlehandedly established a tendency for 'spiral\nnebulae' to be redshifted (21 out of 25 cases). From a modern perspective, it\ncould seem surprising that the expansion of the universe was not announced at\nthis point. Examination of Slipher's papers shows that he reached a more subtle\nconclusion: the identification of cosmological peculiar velocities, including\nthe bulk motion of the Milky Way, leading to a beautiful argument in favour of\nnebulae as distant stellar systems. Nevertheless, Slipher's data actually\ncontain evidence at >8sigma for a positive mean velocity, even after\nsubtracting the dipole owing to the motion of the observer. In 1929, Hubble\nestimated distances for a sample of no greater depth, using redshifts due\nalmost entirely to Slipher. Hubble's distances were flawed in two distinct\nways: in addition to an incorrect absolute calibration, the largest distances\nwere systematically under-estimated. Nevertheless, he claimed the detection of\na linear distance-redshift relation. Statistically, the evidence for such a\ncorrelation is less strong than the simple evidence for a positive mean\nvelocity in Hubble's sample. Comparison with modern data shows that a sample of\nmore than twice Hubble's depth would generally be required in order to reveal\nclearly the global linear expansion in the face of the 'noise' from peculiar\nvelocities. When the theoretical context of the time is examined, the role of\nthe de Sitter model and its prediction of a linear distance-redshift relation\nlooms large. A number of searches for this relation were performed prior to\nHubble over the period 1924-1928, with a similar degree of success. All were\nbased on the velocities measured by Slipher, whose work from a Century ago\nstands out both for the precision of his measurements and for the subtle\nclarity of the arguments he employed to draw correct conclusions from them.\n","Comment: Refereed contribution to the proceedings of \"Origins of the Expanding\n  Universe: 1912-1932\", M.

General theorems which provide conditions\nfor nonemptiness, give a formula for the dimension, and characterize the\nvertices, edges and face lattices of such polytopes are obtained. Many of these\nresults are expressed in terms of certain spanning subgraphs of G which are\nassociated with subsets or elements of the polytope. For example, it is shown\nthat an element u of the fractional perfect b-matching polytope of G is a\nvertex of the polytope if and only if each component of the graph of u either\nis acyclic or else contains exactly one cycle with that cycle having odd\nlength, where the graph of u is defined to be the spanning subgraph of G whose\nedges are those at which u is positive.\n","Comment: 37 pages"]}]

Apart\nfrom those available with the maximal entanglement, these quantum Nash\nequilibria are extensions of the Nash equilibria in classical game theory. The\nphase structure of the equilibria is determined for all values of entanglement,\nand thereby the possibility of resolving the dilemmas by entanglement in the\ngame of Chicken, the Battle of the Sexes, the Prisoners' Dilemma, and the Stag\nHunt, is examined. We find that entanglement transforms these dilemmas with\neach other but cannot resolve them, except in the Stag Hunt game where the\ndilemma can be alleviated to a certain degree.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 9 figures, PlainTeX"]}]
