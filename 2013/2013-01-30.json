In response to this,\nmany energy-aware scheduling algorithms have been developed primarily using the\ndynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) capability which has been incorporated\ninto recent commodity processors. Majority of these algorithms involve two\npasses: schedule generation and slack reclamation. The former pass involves the\nredistribution of tasks among DVFS-enabled processors based on a given cost\nfunction that includes makespan and energy consumption; and, while the latter\npass is typically achieved by executing individual tasks with slacks at a lower\nprocessor frequency. In this paper, a new slack reclamation algorithm is\nproposed by approaching the energy reduction problem from a different angle.\nFirstly, the problem of task slack reclamation by using combinations of\nprocessors' frequencies is formulated. Secondly, several proofs are provided to\nshow that (1) if the working frequency set of processor is assumed to be\ncontinues, the optimal energy will be always achieved by using only one\nfrequency, (2) for real processors with a discrete set of working frequencies,\nthe optimal energy is always achieved by using at most two frequencies, and (3)\nthese two frequencies are adjacent/neighbouring when processor energy\nconsumption is a convex function of frequency.

We consider (1) fixed flows in which gas is\ncontinually fed with a preferred angular momentum, and (2) free flows in which\nthere is no gas supply and the disks diffuse freely at their outer edges. As\nexpected, we find that for the cases of fixed flows the black hole disk systems\nalways end up aligning on timescales of several 1e6 yr, irrespective of the\ninitial inclinations. If the initial inclination angles are larger than pi/2,\nthe black hole accretion transits from retrograde to prograde fashion, and the\naccreted mass onto the black holes during these two phases is comparable. On\nthe other hand, for the cases of free flows, both alignments and\nanti-alignments can occur, depending on the initial inclinations and the ratios\nof the angular momentum of the disks to that of the black holes. In such cases,\nthe disks will be consumed within timescales of 1e6 yr by black holes accreting\nat the Eddington limit. We propose that there is a close connection between the\nblack hole spin and the lifetime for which the feeding persists, which\ndetermines the observable episodic lifetimes of active galactic nuclei.

Implementing a Monte Carlo tracer particle scheme to determine the\norigin and thermodynamic history of accreting gas, we make quantitative\ncomparisons to an otherwise identical simulation run with the smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-3. Contrasting these two numerical approaches,\nwe find significant physical differences in the thermodynamic history of\naccreted gas in haloes above 10^10.5 solar masses. In agreement with previous\nwork, GADGET simulations show a cold fraction near unity for galaxies forming\nin massive haloes, implying that only a small percentage of accreted gas heats\nto an appreciable fraction of the virial temperature during accretion. The same\ngalaxies in AREPO show a much lower cold fraction, <20% in haloes above 10^11\nsolar masses. This results from a hot gas accretion rate which, at this same\nhalo mass, is an order of magnitude larger than with GADGET, while the cold\naccretion rate is also lower. These discrepancies increase for more massive\nsystems, and we explain both as due to numerical inaccuracies in the standard\nformulation of SPH. We also observe that the relatively sharp transition from\ncold to hot mode dominated accretion, at a halo mass of ~10^11, is a\nconsequence of comparing past gas temperatures to a constant threshold value\nindependent of virial temperature. Examining the spatial distribution of\naccreting gas, we find that gas filaments in GADGET tend to remain collimated\nand flow coherently to small radii, or artificially fragment and form a large\nnumber of purely numerical \"blobs\".

It\nis difficult to estimate numerically a systematic uncertainty in R0 due to the\nbandwagon effect; however, it is highly probable that, even if widely accepted\nvalues differ appreciably from the true value, the published results should\neventually approach the true value despite the bandwagon effect. This should be\nmanifest as a trend in the published R0 data: if this trend is statistically\nsignificant, the presence of the bandwagon effect can be suspected in the data.\nFifty two determinations of R0 published over the last 20 years were analyzed.\nThese data reveal no statistically significant trend, suggesting they are\nunlikely to involve any systematic uncertainty due to the bandwagon effect. At\nthe same time, the published data show a gradual and statistically significant\ndecrease in the uncertainties in the R0 determinations with time.\n","Comment: extended part of arXiv:1202.6128"]}]
