If the cutoffs imposed by the angular acceptance are\nindependent of the azimuth, at first sight they do not appear dangerous for a\nmeasurement of the cos(2\\phi)-asymmetry, relevant because of its association\nwith the violation of the Lam-Tung rule and with the Boer-Mulders function. On\nthe contrary, direct simulations show that up to 10 percent asymmetries are\nproduced by these cutoffs. These artificial asymmetries present qualitative\nfeatures that allow them to mimic the physical ones. They introduce some\nmodel-dependence in the measurements of the cos(2\\phi)-asymmetry, since a\nprecise reconstruction of the acceptance in the Collins-Soper frame requires a\nMonte Carlo simulation, that in turn requires some detailed physical input to\ngenerate event distributions. Although experiments in the eighties seem to have\nbeen aware of this problem, the possibility of using the Boer-Mulders function\nas an input parameter in the extraction of Transversity has much increased the\nrequirements of precision on this measurement.

On the basis of this generalized conjecture, we further\nextend the conjecture to Grover's quantum search algorithm, whose speedup is\nlarge but quadratic.

The main contribution comes from z<2, where dark energy\nleads to a decay of potentials. As the same photons are gravitationally lensed\nby these decaying potentials, there exists a high degree of correlation between\nthe ISW effect and CMB lensing, leading to a non-zero three-point correlation\n(bispectrum) of the observed temperature anisotropy. This ISW-lensing\nbispectrum, whose shape resembles that of the so-called \"local-form\" primordial\nbispectrum parametrized by fNL, is known to be the largest contamination of\nfNL. In order to avoid a spurious detection of primordial non-Gaussianity, we\nneed to remove the ISW-lensing bias. In this work, we investigate three\ndebiasing methods: (I) subtraction of an expected, ensemble average of the\nISW-lensing bispectrum; (II) subtraction of a measured ISW-lensing bispectrum;\nand (III) direct subtraction of an estimated ISW signal from an observed\ntemperature map. One may use an estimation of the ISW map from external non-CMB\ndata or that from the CMB data themselves. As the methods II and III are based\non fewer assumptions about the nature of dark energy, they are preferred over\nthe method I. While the methods I and II yield unbiased estimates of fNL with\ncomparable error bars, the method III yields a biased result when the\nunderlying primordial fNL is non-zero and the ISW map is estimated from a\nlensing potential reconstructed from the observed temperature map. One of the\nsources of the bias is a lensing reconstruction noise bias which is independent\nof fNL and can be calculated precisely, but other fNL-dependent terms are\ndifficult to compute reliably. We thus conclude that the method II is the best,\nmodel-independent way to remove the ISW-lensing bias of fNL, enabling us to\ntest the physics of inflation with smaller systematic errors.\n","Comment: 17 pages, comments are welcomed v2: references added, v3: references\n  added"]}]

In this problem Alice and Bob hold sets\n$S, T \\subseteq [n]$, respectively, and the goal is to decide if $S \\cap T =\n\\emptyset$. Reductions from set disjointness are a canonical way of proving\nlower bounds in data stream algorithms, data structures, and distributed\ncomputation. In these applications, often the set sizes $|S|$ and $|T|$ are\nbounded by a value $k$ which is much smaller than $n$. This is referred to as\nsmall set disjointness. A major restriction in the above applications is the\nnumber of rounds that the protocol can make, which, e.g., translates to the\nnumber of passes in streaming applications. A fundamental question is thus in\nunderstanding the round complexity of the small set disjointness problem. For\nan essentially equivalent problem, called OR-Equality, Brody et. al showed that\nwith $r$ rounds of communication, the randomized communication complexity is\n$\\Omega(k \\ilog^r k)$, where$\\ilog^r k$ denotes the $r$-th iterated logarithm\nfunction.

This is so because there are\ngeneral and definite rules for the change of subjective probabilities through\ninformation or experience; induction and belief change are one and same topic,\nafter all. The most basic of these rules is simply to conditionalize with\nrespect to the information received; and there are similar and more general\nrules. 1 Hence, a fundamental reason for the epistemological success of\nprobability theory is that there at all exists a well-behaved concept of\nconditional probability. Still, people have, and have reasons for, various\nconcerns over probability theory. One of these is my starting point:\nIntuitively, we have the notion of plain belief; we believe propositions2 to be\ntrue (or to be false or neither). Probability theory, however, offers no formal\ncounterpart to this notion. Believing A is not the same as having probability 1\nfor A, because probability 1 is incorrigible3; but plain belief is clearly\ncorrigible. And believing A is not the same as giving A a probability larger\nthan some 1 - c, because believing A and believing B is usually taken to be\nequivalent to believing A & B.4 Thus, it seems that the formal representation\nof plain belief has to take a non-probabilistic route. Indeed, representing\nplain belief seems easy enough: simply represent an epistemic state by the set\nof all propositions believed true in it or, since I make the common assumption\nthat plain belief is deductively closed, by the conjunction of all propositions\nbelieved true in it. But this does not yet provide a theory of induction, i.e.\nan answer to the question how epistemic states so represented are changed\ntbrough information or experience. There is a convincing partial answer: if the\nnew information is compatible with the old epistemic state, then the new\nepistemic state is simply represented by the conjunction of the new information\nand the old beliefs. This answer is partial because it does not cover the quite\ncommon case where the new information is incompatible with the old beliefs. It\nis, however, important to complete the answer and to cover this case, too;\notherwise, we would not represent plain belief as conigible. The crucial\nproblem is that there is no good completion. When epistemic states are\nrepresented simply by the conjunction of all propositions believed true in it,\nthe answer cannot be completed; and though there is a lot of fruitful work, no\nother representation of epistemic states has been proposed, as far as I know,\nwhich provides a complete solution to this problem. In this paper, I want to\nsuggest such a solution. In [4], I have more fully argued that this is the only\nsolution, if certain plausible desiderata are to be satisfied. Here, in section\n2, I will be content with formally defining and intuitively explaining my\nproposal. I will compare my proposal with probability theory in section 3. It\nwill turn out that the theory I am proposing is structurally homomorphic to\nprobability theory in important respects and that it is thus equally easily\nimplementable, but moreover computationally simpler. Section 4 contains a very\nbrief comparison with various kinds of logics, in particular conditional logic,\nwith Shackle's functions of potential surprise and related theories, and with\nthe Dempster - Shafer theory of belief functions.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in\n  Artificial Intelligence (UAI1988)"]}]

In the B-P diagram, the\npositions of BPSRs and their relations to the binary parameters, such as the\ncompanion mass, orbital period and eccentricity, are illustrated and discussed.\nIn addition, for the seven BPSRs located above the limit spin-up line, possible\ncauses are suggested.\n","Comment: 8 pages,6figures, 1 table; accepted for publication in Astrophysics\n  and Space Science"]}]

Then each subset will sparsely represent well for its\nown class but not for the others.
