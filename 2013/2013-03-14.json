While an energetically adequate population of star-forming galaxies\nmay be in place, it is unknown whether a large enough fraction of their\nionizing radiation can escape into the intergalactic medium. Attempts to\nmeasure this escape-fraction in intensely star-forming galaxies at lower\nredshifts have largely yielded upper limits. In this paper we present new HST\nCOS and archival FUSE far-UV spectroscopy of a sample of eleven Lyman Break\nAnalogs (LBAs), a rare population of local galaxies that strongly resemble the\nhigh-z Lyman Break galaxies. We combine these data with SDSS optical spectra\nand Spitzer photometry. We also analyze archival FUSE observations of fifteen\ntypical UV-bright local starbursts. We find evidence of small covering factors\nfor optically-thick neutral gas in 3 cases. This is based on two independent\npieces of evidence: a significant residual intensity in the cores of the\nstrongest interstellar absorption-lines tracing neutral gas and a small ratio\nof extinction-corrected H-alpha to UV plus far-IR luminosities. These objects\nrepresent three of the four LBAs that contain a young, very compact (~100pc),\nand highly massive (~10^9 Mo) dominant central object (DCO). These three\nobjects also differ from the other galaxies in showing a significant amount of\nblueshifted Ly-alpha emission, which may be related to the low covering factor\nof neutral gas. All four LBAs with DCOs in our sample show extremely high\nvelocity outflows of interstellar gas, with line centroids blueshifted by about\n700km/s and maximum outflow velocities reaching at least 1500km/s. We show that\nthese properties are consistent with an outflow driven by a powerful starburst\nthat is exceptionally compact. We speculate that such extreme feedback may be\nrequired to enable the escape of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ. 14 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]}]

The\nbinary exerts a gravitational torque on the circumbinary disk and thereby the\norbital angular momentum is transferred to it, while the angular momentum of\nthe circumbinary disk is transferred to the binary through the mass accretion.\nThe binary undergoes an orbital decay due to both the gravitational wave\nemission and the binary-disk interaction. This causes the phase evolution of\nthe gravitational wave signal. The precise measurement of the gravitational\nwave phase thus may provide information regarding the circumbinary disk. In\nthis paper, we assess the detectability of the signature of the binary-disk\ninteraction using the future space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as\nDECIGO and BBO by the standard matched filtering analysis.

In this paper, using a\ngeneralized moving least squares (GMLS) approximation, a new direct MLPG\ntechnique, called DMLPG, is presented. Following the principle of meshless\nmethods to express everything \"entirely in terms of nodes\", the generalized MLS\nrecovers test functionals directly from values at nodes, without any detour via\nshape functions. This leads to a cheaper and even more accurate scheme. In\nparticular, the complete absence of shape functions allows numerical\nintegrations in the weak forms of the problem to be done over low{degree\npolynomials instead of complicated shape functions. Hence, the standard MLS\nshape function subroutines are not called at all. Numerical examples illustrate\nthe superiority of the new technique over the classical MLPG. On the\ntheoretical side, this paper discusses stability and convergence for the new\ndiscretizations that replace those of the standard MLPG.

The parameters of the formula are obtained by making\na least square fit to the available experimental data. The calculated\nhalf-lives are compared with an other model-independent scaling law proposed\nearlier by Horoi {\\it et al}. Also, the calculated results of this formula are\ncompared with the recent results of the preformed cluster model for $^{12}$C\nand $^{14}$C emissions from different deformed and superdeformed Nd and Gd\nparents.
