In these approaches, new composite features are typically constructed\nby aggregating the expression levels of several genes. The secondary data\nsources are employed to guide this aggregation. Although many studies claim\nthat these approaches improve classification performance over single gene\nclassifiers, the gain in performance is difficult to assess. This stems mainly\nfrom the fact that different breast cancer data sets and validation procedures\nare employed to assess the performance. Here we address these issues by\nemploying a large cohort of six breast cancer data sets as benchmark set and by\nperforming an unbiased evaluation of the classification accuracies of the\ndifferent approaches. Contrary to previous claims, we find that composite\nfeature classifiers do not outperform simple single gene classifiers. We\ninvestigate the effect of (1) the number of selected features; (2) the specific\ngene set from which features are selected; (3) the size of the training set and\n(4) the heterogeneity of the data set on the performance of composite feature\nand single gene classifiers. Strikingly, we find that randomization of\nsecondary data sources, which destroys all biological information in these\nsources, does not result in a deterioration in performance of composite feature\nclassifiers. Finally, we show that when a proper correction for gene set size\nis performed, the stability of single gene sets is similar to the stability of\ncomposite feature sets.

In this sense,\nchanges to the level of network visibility can have a significant impact on\nalgorithm design.\n  We study a range of problems under this model of algorithms with local\ninformation. We first consider the case in which the underlying graph is a\npreferential attachment network. We show that one can find the node of maximum\ndegree in the network in a polylogarithmic number of steps, using an\nopportunistic algorithm that repeatedly queries the visible node of maximum\ndegree. This addresses an open question of Bollob{\\'a}s and Riordan. In\ncontrast, local information algorithms require a linear number of queries to\nsolve the problem on arbitrary networks.\n  Motivated by problems faced by recruiters in online networks, we also\nconsider network coverage problems such as finding a minimum dominating set.\nFor this optimization problem we show that, if each node added to the output\nset reveals sufficient information about the set's neighborhood, then it is\npossible to design randomized algorithms for general networks that nearly match\nthe best approximations possible even with full access to the graph structure.\nWe show that this level of visibility is necessary.\n  We conclude that a network provider's decision of how much structure to make\nvisible to its users can have a significant effect on a user's ability to\ninteract strategically with the network.\n","Comment: An extended abstract of this work appeared in the 8th Workshop on\n  Internet & Network Economics (WINE 2012)"]}]

In order to extract an economically useful amount of\npower, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array. This\nnaturally leads to the question of how these turbines should be configured to\nextract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning\nof the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is\nof major economic interest. However, manual optimisation is difficult due to\nlegal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the\ncubic dependence of the power on the flow speed. The novel contribution of this\npaper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained\nby a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based\noptimisation algorithm. In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional\nfinite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the\ncurrent array configuration. The gradient of the power extracted with respect\nto the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a\nfraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated\nadjoint equations. These equations propagate causality backwards through the\ncomputation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the\ntuning parameters. This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the\nnumber of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application. The utility\nof the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised\nscenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound\nof the Pentland Firth, Scotland.\n"]}]

Recent\nresearch has shown that the EMD plays a crucial role in studying the potential\nimpact of Demand-Responsive Transportation (DRT) and Mobility-on-Demand (MoD)\nsystems, which are growing paradigms for one-way vehicle sharing where people\ndrive (or are driven by) shared vehicles from a point of origin to a point of\ndestination. While the ubiquitous physical transportation setting is the road\nnetwork, characterized by systems of roads connected together by interchanges,\nmost analytical works about vehicle sharing represent distances between points\nin a plane using the simple Euclidean metric. Instead, we consider the EMD when\nthe ground metric is taken from a class of one-dimensional, continuous metric\nspaces, reminiscent of road networks. We produce an explicit formulation of the\nEarth movers distance given any finite road network R. The result generalizes\nthe EMD with a Euclidean R1 ground metric, which had remained one of the only\nknown non-discrete cases with an explicit formula. Our formulation casts the\nEMD as the optimal value of a finite-dimensional, real-valued optimization\nproblem, with a convex objective function and linear constraints.

The lattice\ncohomology is an important tool in the study of topological properties of a\nplumbed 3-manifold M associated with a connected negative definite plumbing\ngraph G. It connects the topological properties with analytic ones when M is\nrealized as a singularity link, i.e. when G is a good resolution graph of the\nsingularity. Its computation is based on the (Riemann-Roch) weights of the\nlattice points of \\Z^s, where s is the number of vertices of G. The first part\nof the thesis reduces the rank of this lattice to the number of `bad' vertices\nof the graph. Usually, the geometry/topology of M is encoded exactly by these\n`bad' vertices and their number measures how far the plumbing graph stays from\na rational one.

For this, we construct the corresponding\npolytope from the plumbing graph, together with an action of H_1(M,\\Z), and we\ndevelop Ehrhart theory for them.

This may have connections to\nslave boson techniques used for the study of this model. Our approach is\ncomputationally more efficient than any used previously for the calculation of\nthe high temperature expansion of dynamic correlation functions, and high order\nresults for both the Green's function and the time-dependent density-density\nand spin-spin correlation functions shall be presented in a separate paper\n[25].\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

The two types of surfaces used were 80% cavity\nfraction ribs and posts with a periodic spacing of 40 {\\mu}m and 32 {\\mu}m,\nrespectively. All surfaces were manufactured through photolithography. The\nimpact Weber number is used as the dynamic parameter to compare splash and\nrebound behaviors between the two types of surfaces. While droplets exhibit\nsimilar dynamics at low Weber numbers, rebound jet speed (normalized by droplet\nimpact speed) is notably higher on posts than ribs for all Weber numbers tested\nhere (5<We<900). At elevated Weber numbers, droplets splash peripherally. These\nside droplets created at splash are referred to as satellite droplets. Top view\nvideos show the significant difference in splashing behavior for the two\nsurface types. On ribs, satellite droplet formation consistently prefers a path\n60{\\deg} from the ribs longitudinal direction. This behavior prevails for Weber\nnumbers greater than 150, however, distinguished splashing does not occur for\nWe > 265. On posts, satellite droplets also follow a specific path but in a\ndifferent orientation. Satellite droplets form in locations aligned with the\npost lattice structure. This behavior is observed for 600 < We < 750. Jet\nrebound exhibits an interesting phenomenon on ribs under certain conditions.\nDue to the uneven shear distribution on the retracting droplet due to the\nsurface anisotropy, two jets form at rebound and are referred to as two-pronged\njets. This behavior occurs for 115 < We < 265 on ribs. Two-pronged jets are\nalso observed on posts but are less coherent and less repetitive. This behavior\nwas observed at around 500 < We < 600.\n","Comment: videos are included"]}]
