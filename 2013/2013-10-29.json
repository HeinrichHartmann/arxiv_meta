Both the average macroscopic behavior and the fluctuating\nproperties of the hydrodynamic fields are obtained from the microscopic\ndynamics. This analysis yields a fluctuating balance equation for the local\nenergy density at the mesoscopic level, characterized by two terms: (i) a\ndiffusive term, with a current that fluctuates around its average behavior\ngiven by nonlinear Fourier's law, and (ii) a dissipation term which is a\ngeneral function of the local energy density. The quasi-elasticity of\nmicroscopic dynamics, required in order to have a nontrivial competition\nbetween diffusion and dissipation in the macroscopic limit, implies a noiseless\ndissipation term in the balance equation, so dissipation fluctuations are\nenslaved to those of the density field. The microscopic complexity is thus\ncondensed in just three transport coefficients, the diffusivity, the mobility\nand a new dissipation coefficient, which are explicitly calculated within a\nlocal equilibrium approximation. Interestingly, the diffusivity and mobility\ncoefficients obey an Einstein relation despite the fully nonequilibrium\ncharacter of the problem.

Generalization of this has\nbeen a long standing open problem due to the difficulties faced in the\nconstruction of a Majorana like geometric representation for symmetric mixed\nstate. We have overcome this problem by developing a method of classifying\nlocal unitary (LU) equivalent classes of symmetric $N$-qubit mixed states based\non the geometrical Multiaxial Representation (MAR) of the density matrix. In\naddition to the two parameters defined for the entanglement classification of\nthe symmetric pure states based on MR, namely, diversity degree and degeneracy\nconfiguration, we show that another parameter called rank needs to be\nintroduced for symmetric mixed state classification. Our scheme of\nclassification is more general as it can be applied to both pure and mixed\nstates. To bring out the similarities/ differences between the MR and MAR, $ N\n$-qubit GHZ state is taken up for a detailed study. We conclude that pure state\nclassification based on MR is not a special case of our classification scheme\nbased on MAR. We also give a recipe to identify the most general symmetric\n$N$-qubit pure separable states. The power of our method is demonstrated using\nseveral well known examples of symmetric two qubit pure and mixed states as\nwell as three qubit pure states.

The depletion timescale and gas fractions of the z>2 normal\nstar-forming galaxies can be explained under the \"equilibrium model\" for galaxy\nevolution, in which the gas reservoir of galaxies is the primary driver of the\nredshift evolution of specific star formation rates. Due to their high star\nformation efficiencies and low metallicities, the z>2 lensed galaxies have warm\ndust despite being located on the star formation main sequence. At fixed\nmetallicity, they also have a gas-to-dust ratio 1.7 times larger than observed\nlocally when using the same standard techniques, suggesting that applying the\nlocal calibration of the relation between gas-to-dust ratio and metallicity to\ninfer the molecular gas mass of high redshift galaxies may lead to systematic\ndifferences with CO-based estimates.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

As a result, the number of data instances to be\nentered into the optimization can be substantially reduced.

We also show that the DVI technique can be extended to detect\nnon-support vectors in the least absolute deviations regression (LAD). To the\nbest of our knowledge, there are currently no screening methods for LAD. We\nhave evaluated DVI on both synthetic and real data sets.

In disease, network entropy predicts a higher level of\ncellular plasticity in cancer stem cell populations compared to ordinary cancer\ncells. Importantly, network entropy also allows identification of key\ndifferentiation pathways.

These applications\nrequire measuring and differentiating the visibility of an object (target) from\ndifferent viewpoints in a dataspace, e.g., a billboard may be seen from two\nviewpoints but is readable only from the viewpoint closer to the target. In\nthis paper, we formulate the above problem of quantifying the visibility of\n(from) a target object from (of) the surrounding area with a visibility color\nmap (VCM). A VCM is essentially defined as a surface color map of the space,\nwhere each viewpoint of the space is assigned a color value that denotes the\nvisibility measure of the target from that viewpoint. Measuring the visibility\nof a target even from a single viewpoint is an expensive operation, as we need\nto consider factors such as distance, angle, and obstacles between the\nviewpoint and the target. Hence, a straightforward approach to construct the\nVCM that requires visibility computation for every viewpoint of the surrounding\nspace of the target, is prohibitively expensive in terms of both I/Os and\ncomputation, especially for a real dataset comprising of thousands of\nobstacles. We propose an efficient approach to compute the VCM based on a key\nproperty of the human vision that eliminates the necessity of computing the\nvisibility for a large number of viewpoints of the space. To further reduce the\ncomputational overhead, we propose two approximations; namely, minimum bounding\nrectangle and tangential approaches with guaranteed error bounds.

The\nstudy attempts to reveal the constructive effects and deconstructive defects of\nmigration to cloud computing with a close regard into prior literature and\npractical practices all around the world.

It uses two features of speech to\ndiscriminate speech from impulse noise: one is the slow time-varying nature of\nspeech and the other is the Lipschitz regularity of the speech components. On\nthe basis of these features, an algorithm has been developed to identify and\nsuppress wavelet coefficients that correspond to impulse noise.

New densities of invariant measures have been established, also for\nbilliard systems which contain symmetry walls, according to the content of Weyl\nreflections in the maps, which account for the change of sign of the\nnon-oscillating scale factors in the solution to the Einstein field equations.\nThe statistical equivalence between the big billiard and the small billiard,\nposed in [Phys. Rev. D83, 044038 (2011)], is here proven by means of these new\ndefinitions of probabilities for the small billiard. Further new classes of BKL\nprobabilities have also been defined especially for the one-variable map and\nfor the two-variable map, for the early-time BKL dynamics, for a stochastizing\nBKL dynamics and for a completely stochastized dynamics, both for the big\nbilliard and for the small billiard. The trajectories have been classified\naccording to these new probabilties, and different specifications of\nprobabilties comparing classes of initial conditions have been assigned for the\nstochastization of the dynamics. As a result, is is possible to establish a\ndefinition of BKL probabilities for the unquotiented dynamics of the big\nbilliard, where the different patterns of Weyl reflections are encoded. The\nstatistical description of BKL probabilities for the occurrence of a given\nnumber of epochs in each era are therefore further characterized by the most\nprobable number of Weyl reflections contained in such eras, which is inferred\nfrom the implications of the billiard maps on the UPHP. These new constructions\nhave been considered for the determination of the connection between the\nobserved values of anisotropy by a stochastic limit of the BKL dynamics.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables"]}]

From 2000 to 2013.5 a GST plateau is observed while the GCMs\npredicted a warming rate of about 2 K/century. In contrast, the hypothesis that\nthe climate is regulated by specific natural oscillations more accurately fits\nthe GST records at multiple time scales. The climate sensitivity to CO2\ndoubling should be reduced by half, e.g. from the IPCC-2007 2.0-4.5 K range to\n1.0-2.3 K with 1.5 C median. Also modern paleoclimatic temperature\nreconstructions yield the same conclusion. The observed natural oscillations\ncould be driven by astronomical forcings.
