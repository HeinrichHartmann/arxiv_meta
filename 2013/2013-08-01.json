The emittance of the incoming beam will be measured in the\nupstream magnetic spectrometer with a scintillating fiber tracker. A cooling\ncell will then follow, alternating energy loss in Liquid Hydrogen (LH2)\nabsorbers to RF cavity acceleration. A second spectrometer, identical to the\nfirst, and a second muon identification system will measure the outgoing\nemittance. In the 2010 run at RAL the muon beamline and most detectors were\nfully commissioned and a first measurement of the emittance of the muon beam\nwith particle physics (time-of-flight) detectors was performed.

In this paper we study finite games that are\ndiscretized contests, and the problems of computing exact and approximate Nash\nequilibria. Our motivation is the worst-case hardness of Nash equilibrium\ncomputation, and the resulting interest in important classes of games that\nadmit polynomial-time algorithms. For games that have a tie-breaking rule for\nplayers' scores, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an exact\nequilibrium in the 2-player case, and for multiple players, a characterization\nof Nash equilibria that shows an interesting parallel between these games and\nunrestricted 2-player games in normal form. When ties are allowed, via a\nreduction from these games to a subclass of anonymous games, we give\napproximation schemes for two special cases: constant-sized set of strategies,\nand constant number of players.\n","Comment: 21 pages; preliminary version in ACM-EC 2010; accepted for\n  publication in Theoretical Computer Science"]}]

With\nachieving intense fundamental interests, the demands to synthesize such FLG are\nrapidly increasing. However, the potential applications of such FLG, especially\nin composite science and energy storage devices, are practically hindered\nbecause of non-fulfillment of required production rate. Additionally, synthesis\nof such FLG with controlled layer-numbers still remains an unsolved challenge.\nFurther breakthroughs in this direction are thus highly desirable. The present\narticle is a step ahead in this direction and is possibly the first of its\nkind. Here we show how such FLG, with precisely controlled number of layers,\ncan readily be obtained from an isostatically compacted synthetic graphite, by\ncontrolled dynamic fracture, with microbranching instability, induced by\ncold-thermal-shock and discovered the mechanism behind such transformation by a\ntheoretical modeling.\n","Comment: Due to some crucial structure modification the present version is\n  withdrawn and subsequently the correct version is being archived"]}]
