Namely, the items can be grouped together in pools, and a single\nmeasurement would reveal whether there are one or more defectives in the pool.\nThe threshold model is a generalization of this idea where a measurement\nreturns positive if the number of defectives in the pool reaches a fixed\nthreshold $u > 0$, negative if this number is no more than a fixed lower\nthreshold $\\ell < u$, and may behave arbitrarily otherwise. We study\nnon-adaptive threshold group testing (in a possibly noisy setting) and show\nthat, for this problem, $O(d^{g+2} (\\log d) \\log(n/d))$ measurements (where $g\n:= u-\\ell-1$ and $u$ is any fixed constant) suffice to identify the defectives,\nand also present almost matching lower bounds. This significantly improves the\npreviously known (non-constructive) upper bound $O(d^{u+1} \\log(n/d))$.\nMoreover, we obtain a framework for explicit construction of measurement\nschemes using lossless condensers.

To get to the turbulent state, the vortices progress\nthrough the following steps: First, until the first reconnection, the vortex\ndynamics is largely consistent with existing work on strong, possibly singular,\ngrowth of the vorticity in the Euler equations. Second, vortex reconnection at\nthe junction of the primary symmetry planes meet. About half of the circulation\nfrom each vortex reconnects into two \"bridges\", leaving behind two \"threads\",\nwith the bridges and threads arranged into 4 orthogonal pairs. In the third\nstep, stretching is induced by new anti-parallel attractions due to the\ntwisting that forms along the reconnected vortices. This extra stretching then\npulls on the threads as they wind around the bridges, resulting in spirals over\nthe entire vortices. In the fourth step, multiple vortex rings form through\nmultiple reconnections, with each ring consisting of spiral vortices. A\n$k^{-5/3}$ energy spectra begins to form after the first ring separates and\neventually covers one decade. It is argued that the spirals are the source of\nthe $k^{-5/3}$ spectra that develops. Furthermore, a new hierarchy of rescaled\nvorticity moments is found where the lower-order moments bound the higher-order\nmoments for all orders and all times.\n","Comment: To appear in the {\\it Procedia IUTAM} volume of papers for\n  Understanding Common Aspects of Extreme Events in Fluids, Dublin, 2-6 July\n  2012. as Fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence from a chain reaction of\n  reconnection events"]}]

Many complex diseases such as type 1 and 2\ndiabetes, autism, bipolar disorder, allergies, Alzheimer disease, and some\ncancers show significantly higher concordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins than in\ndizygotic twins (DZ) or parent-child pairs, suggesting their etiology is\nstrongly influenced by genetics.

In this type of model, the elasticity of the\nnetwork derives from the entropic changes arising from a displacement of the\nnetwork junction positions. The shortcoming of this approach is clear from the\nobservation that unswollen rubbery materials are nearly incompressible,\nreflecting the existence of strong intermolecular interactions that restrict\nthe polymer chains to an exploration of their local tube-like molecular\nenvironments. The imposition of a deformation of these solid rubbery materials\nthen necessitates a consideration of how the local molecular packing\nconstraints become modified under deformation and the impact of these changes\non the macroscopic elasticity of the material as a whole.

This\nabstracts facility-location settings where one has the flexibility of moving\nfacilities from their current locations to other destinations so as to serve\nclients more efficiently by reducing their assignment costs.\n  We give the first {\\em local-search based} approximation algorithm for this\nproblem and achieve the best-known approximation guarantee. Our main result is\n$(3+\\epsilon)$-approximation for this problem for any constant $\\epsilon>0$\nusing local search. The previous best guarantee was an 8-approximation\nalgorithm based on LP-rounding. Our guarantee {\\em matches} the best-known\napproximation guarantee for the $k$-median problem. Since there is an\napproximation-preserving reduction from the $k$-median problem to \\mfl, any\nimprovement of our result would imply an analogous improvement for the\n$k$-median problem. Furthermore, {\\em our analysis is tight} (up to $o(1)$\nfactors) since the tight example for the local-search based 3-approximation\nalgorithm for $k$-median can be easily adapted to show that our local-search\nalgorithm has a tight approximation ratio of 3. One of the chief novelties of\nthe analysis is that in order to generate a suitable collection of local-search\nmoves whose resulting inequalities yield the desired bound on the cost of a\nlocal-optimum, we define a tree-like structure that (loosely speaking)\nfunctions as a \"recursion tree\", using which we spawn off local-search moves by\nexploring this tree to a constant depth.\n"]}]

Chemical vapor deposition was used to synthesize hexagon- shaped\ntBLG with a rotation angle that can be conveniently determined by relative edge\nmisalignment. Superlattice structures are revealed by the observation of two\ndistinctive Raman features: folded optical phonons and enhanced intensity of\nthe 2D-band. Both signatures are strongly correlated with G-line resonance,\nrotation angle and laser excitation energy. The frequency of folded phonons\ndecreases with the increase of the rotation angle due to increasing size of the\nreduced Brillouin zone (rBZ) and the zone folding of transverse optic (TO)\nphonons to the rBZ of superlattices. The anomalous enhancement of 2D-band\nintensity is ascribed to the constructive quantum interference between two\nRaman paths enabled by a near-degenerate Dirac cone. The fabrication and Raman\nidentification of superlattices pave the way for further basic study and new\napplications of tBLG.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures, research article"]}]
