For this purpose, several families of STBCs\nthat involve a reduced decoding complexity have been proposed, notably the\nmulti-group decodable and the fast decodable (FD) codes. Recently, a new family\nof codes that combines both of these families namely the fast group decodable\n(FGD) codes was proposed.

The proposed scheme is then\napplied to the case of four transmit antennas and we show that the new rate-1\nFGD code has the lowest worst-case decoding complexity among existing\ncomparable STBCs. The coding gain of the new rate-1 code is optimized through\nconstellation stretching and proved to be constant irrespective of the\nunderlying QAM constellation prior to normalization. Next, we propose a new\nrate-2 FD STBC by multiplexing two of our rate-1 codes by the means of a\nunitary matrix. Also a compromise between rate and complexity is obtained\nthrough puncturing our rate-2 FD code giving rise to a new rate-3/2 FD code.\nThe proposed codes are compared to existing codes in the literature and\nsimulation results show that our rate-3/2 code has a lower average decoding\ncomplexity while our rate-2 code maintains its lower average decoding\ncomplexity in the low SNR region.

The analogy\nsolutions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulation data,\nable to reproduce empirical relations, and can be viewed as extensions of\nexisting theories. In contrast to Walz's equation for adiabatic CTBL, the mean\ntemperature-velocity relation derived by GRA can be applied to different\nwall-bounded flows in non-adiabatic wall condition, which is achieved by\nextending Walz's adiabatic recovery factor to a heat flux dependent one.

The Seebeck coefficient, S, is large and\nnegative for temperatures from 2 to 300 K ranging from ~ -70\\muV/K at 300 K to\n-4500\\muV/K at 18 K. A large maximum in |S| at 18 K is likely due to phonon\ndrag with the abrupt drop in |S| below 18 K due to the thermal depopulation of\nthe high mobility conduction band. The large thermal conductivity between 10\nand 20 K (~350 W/m/K) is consistent with this interpretation, as are detailed\ncalculations of the Seebeck coefficient made using the complete calculated\nelectronic structure.

In literature, massive cores such as this one are often referred to as\n\"super-Jeans cores\". As starless cores are perhaps on the cusp of forming\nstars, a study of their dynamics will improve our understanding of the\ntransition from the prestellar to the protostellar phase. In the present work\nwe use non-magnetic polytropes belonging originally to the family of the\nIsothermal sphere. For the purpose, perturbations were applied to individual\npolytropes, first by replacing the isothermal gas with a gas that was cold near\nthe centre of the polytrope and relatively warm in the outer regions, and\nsecond, through a slight compression of the polytrope by raising the external\nconfining pressure. Using this latter configuration we identify thermodynamic\nconditions under which a core is likely to remain starless. In fact, we also\nargue that the attribute \"super-Jeans\" is subjective and that these cores do\nnot formally violate the Jeans stability criterion. On the basis of our test\nresults we suggest that gas temperature in a star-forming cloud is crucial\ntowards the formation and evolution of a core.
