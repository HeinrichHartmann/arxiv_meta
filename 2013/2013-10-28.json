First, each transmitter is\nassumed to have a single antenna and serve a singe user in its user group where\neach user has receive antennas less than K. In this case, a K-transmitter\nsingle-input multiple-output (SIMO) interference channel (IC) is constituted\nafter user selection. Without help of multiuser diversity, K-1 interfering\nsignals cannot be perfectly removed at each user since the number of receive\nantennas is smaller than or equal to the number of interferers. Only with\nproper user selection, non-zero DoF per transmitter is achievable as the number\nof users increases. Through geometric interpretation of interfering channels,\nwe show that the multiuser dimensions have to be used first for reducing the\nDoF loss caused by the interfering signals, and then have to be used for\nincreasing the DoF gain from its own signal. The sufficient number of users for\nthe target DoF is derived. We also discuss how the optimal strategy of\nexploiting multiuser diversity can be realized by practical user selection\nschemes.

Filling this gap in our\nunderstanding has new urgency because DNA nanotechnology often depends\ncritically on binding rates. Here we use a coarse-grained model to explore the\nhybridization kinetics of DNA oligomers, finding that strand association\nproceeds through a complex set of intermediate states. Successful binding\nevents start with the formation of a few metastable base-pairing interactions,\nfollowed by zippering of the remaining bonds. However, despite reasonably\nstrong interstrand interactions, initial contacts frequently fail to lead to\nzippering because the typical configurations in which they form differ from\ntypical states of similar enthalpy in the double-stranded equilibrium ensemble.\nTherefore, if the association process is analyzed on the base-pair (secondary\nstructure) level, it shows non-Markovian behavior. Initial contacts must be\nstabilized by two or three base pairs before full zippering is likely,\nresulting in negative effective activation enthalpies. Non-Arrhenius behavior\nis observed as the number of base pairs in the effective transition state\nincreases with temperature. In addition, we find that alternative pathways\ninvolving misbonds can increase association rates. For repetitive sequences,\nmisaligned duplexes frequently rearrange to form fully paired duplexes by two\ndistinct processes which we label `pseudoknot' and `inchworm' internal\ndisplacement. We show how the above processes can explain why experimentally\nobserved association rates of GC-rich oligomers are higher than rates of\nAT-rich equivalents.

We\ncarried out extensive calculations of the classical and quantum currents for\nvarious temperatures, coupling strengths, and barrier heights.

We find that this behavior results from the fact that\nthe tunneling enhances the current in the case of a high barrier, while it\nsuppresses the current in the case of a low barrier. This is because the effect\nof the ratchet potential is weak in the case of a low barrier, due to the large\ndispersion of the distribution introduced by tunneling.

While stationary Turing patterns are broadly\nknown, the oscillatory instability, leading to traveling waves in continuous\nmedia and also called the wave bifurcation, is rare for chemical systems. Here,\nwe extend the analysis by Turing to general networks and apply it to ecological\nmetapopulations of biological species with dispersal connections between\nhabitats. Remarkably, the oscillatory Turing instability does not lead to wave\npatterns in networks, but to spontaneous development of heterogeneous\noscillations and possible extinction of some species, even though they are\nabsent for isolated populations. Furthermore, our theoretical analysis reveals\nthat this instability is more common in ecological metapopulations than in\nchemical reactions. Indeed, we find the instabilities for all possible food\nwebs with three predator or prey species, under various assumptions about the\nmobility of individual species and nonlinear interactions between them.\nTherefore, we suggest that the oscillatory Turing instability is generic and\nmust play a fundamental role in metapopulation dynamics, providing a common\nmechanism for dispersal-induced destabilization of ecosystems.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The procedure is based on a tight integration of IC3\nwith Implicit (predicate) Abstraction, a technique that expresses abstract\ntran- sitions without computing explicitly the abstract system and is\nincremental with respect to the addition of predicates. In this scenario, IC3\noperates only at the Boolean level of the abstract state space, discovering\ninductive clauses over the abstraction predicates. Theory reasoning is confined\nwithin the underlying SMT solver, and applied transparently when performing\nsatisfiability checks. When the current abstraction allows for a spurious\ncounterexample, it is refined by discov- ering and adding a sufficient set of\nnew predicates.

This\napproach shows that, as the radius of a fibril with constant double-twist\nincreases, the periodic layered organization can not be preserved without\nmoving from planar to helicoidal configurations. Such changes of configurations\nare indeed made possible by the edge dislocations naturally present in the\nphyllotactic pattern where their distribution is such that the lateral growth\nof a fibril should stay limited in the observed range.

Their spin history depends\nsensitively on details of the magnetic field structure, but idealized models\nfrom the 1980s and 1990s are still commonly used for calculating the magnetic\nfield components. This paper is the third in a series presenting results from a\nstep-by-step analysis which we are making of the problem, starting with very\nsimple models and then progressively including additional features one at a\ntime, with the aim of gaining new insights into the mechanisms involved. In our\nfirst two papers, the magnetic field structure in the disc was calculated for a\nstandard Shakura and Sunyaev model, by solving the magnetic induction equation\nnumerically in the stationary limit within the kinematic approximation; here we\nconsider a more general velocity field in the disc, including backflow. We find\nthat the profiles of the poloidal and toroidal components of the magnetic field\nare fairly similar in the two cases but that they can be very different from\nthose in the models mentioned above, giving important consequences for the\ntorque exerted on the central object. In particular we find that, contrary to\nwhat is usually thought, some regions of the disc outward of the co-rotation\npoint (rotating more slowly than the neutron star) may nevertheless contribute\nto spinning up the neutron star on account of the detailed structure of the\nmagnetic field in those parts of disc.\n","Comment: Published in MNRAS - 17 pages, 16 figures, 6 Tables"]}]

The count of all possible graceful graphs in a complete graph is\nobtained. An upper bound on the count of gracefully labeled trees in a complete\ngraph is obtained. We settle Graceful Tree Conjecture in the affirmative in two\nways: 1) We show that all trees can be gracefully labeled by assigning the\nlowest label 1 to the so called special vertices of trees, i.e. prependant\nvertices or pendant vertices adjacent to prependant vertices. 2) We establish\nthe existence of graceful labeling for all trees by associating distinct\nlattice paths with trees and by showing the existence of a lattice path for a\ntree of each isomorphism type by showing how to construct a lattice path\nrecursively by starting from the lattice path for its pendant vertex deleted\nsubtree, which is assumed to exists by induction, and carrying out appropriate\nmodification of this lattice path. 3) We propose a crisp algorithm to\ngracefully label tree of every isomorphism type with the help of novel\nrepresentation for any tree in terms of juxtaposition of paths. Lastly, we\ndiscuss an algorithm to find arbitrarily degree constrained graceful spanning\ntree and propose some problems for further investigation.\n","Comment: 39 pages. A new section 7 is added.
