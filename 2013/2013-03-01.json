Past work\nhas focused on designing the network to support all hose matrices (all matrices\nnot exceeding marginal bounds at the nodes). This model may be too conservative\nif additional information on traffic patterns is available. Another extreme is\nthe fixed demand model, where one designs the network to support peak\npoint-to-point demands. We introduce a capped hose model to explore a broader\nrange of traffic matrices which includes the above two as special cases. It is\nknown that optimal designs for the hose model are always determined by\nsingle-hub routing, and for the fixed- demand model are based on shortest-path\nrouting. We shed light on the wider space of capped hose matrices in order to\nsee which traffic models are more shortest path-like as opposed to hub-like. To\naddress the space in between, we use hierarchical multi-hub routing templates,\na generalization of hub and tree routing. In particular, we show that by adding\npeak capacities into the hose model, the single-hub tree-routing template is no\nlonger cost-effective. This initiates the study of a class of robust network\ndesign (RND) problems restricted to these templates. Our empirical analysis is\nbased on a heuristic for this new hierarchical RND problem. We also propose\nthat it is possible to define a routing indicator that accounts for the\nstrengths of the marginals and peak demands and use this information to choose\nthe appropriate routing template.

A.\nFisher proposed for inductive reasoning the use of the fiducial distribution, a\nparameter-space distribution of epistemological probability transferred\ndirectly from limiting relative frequencies rather than computed according to\nthe Bayes update rule. The proposal is developed as follows using the\nconfidence measure of a scalar parameter of interest. (With the restriction to\none-dimensional parameter space, a confidence measure is essentially a fiducial\nprobability distribution free of complications involving ancillary statistics.)\n  A betting game establishes a sense in which confidence measures are the only\nreliable inferential probability distributions. The equality between the\nprobabilities encoded in a confidence measure and the coverage rates of the\ncorresponding confidence intervals ensures that the measure's rule for\nassigning confidence levels to hypotheses is uniquely minimax in the game.\n  Although a confidence measure can be computed without any prior distribution,\nprevious knowledge can be incorporated into confidence-based reasoning. To\nadjust a p-value or confidence interval for prior information, the confidence\nmeasure from the observed data can be combined with one or more independent\nconfidence measures representing previous agent opinion. (The former confidence\nmeasure may correspond to a posterior distribution with frequentist matching of\ncoverage probabilities.) The representation of subjective knowledge in terms of\nconfidence measures rather than prior probability distributions preserves\napproximate frequentist validity.\n","Comment: major revision"]}]
