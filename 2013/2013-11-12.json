Furthermore, if the\neigenvalues, xi, of X satisfy the property -pi < Im(xi) < pi, then X is unique.\nIt is also known that under the same condition every real n x n matrix, A, has\na real square root, that is, there is a real matrix, X, such that X^2 = A.\nMoreover, if the eigenvalues, rho e^{i theta}, of X satisfy the condition -pi/2\n< theta < pi/2, then X is unique. These theorems are the theoretical basis for\nvarious numerical methods for exponentiating a matrix or for computing its\nlogarithm using a method known as scaling and squaring (resp. inverse scaling\nand squaring).

Exact inference such as computing the marginal distributions and the\npartition function has complexity $O(k^{2}n)$ using message-passing algorithms,\nwhere k is the size of the FVS, and n is the total number of nodes.

For\nblocks of size d=2 the result rules out any small formulations using\nsecond-order cone programming. Our study of SDP lifts over Cartesian product of\nfixed-size positive semidefinite cones is motivated mainly from practical\nconsiderations where it is well known that such SDPs can be solved more\nefficiently than general SDPs.

Our main contribution is a $1-O(\\sqrt{(\\log{d})/B})$-competitive\nonline algorithm, where $d$ denotes the column sparsity, i.e., the maximum\nnumber of resources that occur in a single column, and $B$ denotes the capacity\nratio $B$, i.e., the ratio between the capacity of a resource and the maximum\ndemand for this resource.
