Using the decomposition presented in McKeon & Sharma (J. Fluid Mech,\n658, 2010), complex coherent structure is recreated from minimal superpositions\nof response modes predicted by the analysis, which take the form of\nradially-varying travelling waves. By way of example, simple combinations of\nthese modes are offered that predicts hairpins and modulated hairpin packets.\n  The phase interaction also predicts important skewness and correlation\nresults known in the literature.\n  It is also shown that the very large scale motions act to organise\nhairpin-like structures such that they co-locate with areas of low streamwise\nmomentum, by a mechanism of locally varying the shear profile.\n  The relationship between Taylor's hypothesis and coherence is discussed and\nboth are shown to be the consequence of the localisation of the response modes\naround the critical layer.\n  A pleasing link is made to the classical laminar inviscid theory, whereby the\nessential mechanism underlying the hairpin vortex is captured by two obliquely\ninteracting Kelvin-Stuart (cat's eye) vortices. Evidence for the theory is\npresented based on comparison to observations of structure reported in the\nexperimental, transitional flow and turbulent flow numerical simulation\nliterature.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics. 41 pages"]}]

However, the calculations of TPE corrections\nhave significant model dependence, and there is limited direct experimental\nevidence for such corrections. We present the results of a new experimental\ntechnique for making direct $e^\\pm p$ comparisons, which has the potential to\nmake precise measurements over a broad range in $Q^2$ and scattering angles. We\nuse the Jefferson Lab electron beam and the Hall B photon tagger to generate a\nclean but untagged photon beam. The photon beam impinges on a converter foil to\ngenerate a mixed beam of electrons, positrons, and photons. A chicane is used\nto separate and recombine the electron and positron beams while the photon beam\nis stopped by a photon blocker. This provides a combined electron and positron\nbeam, with energies from 0.5 to 3.2 GeV, which impinges on a liquid hydrogen\ntarget. The large acceptance CLAS detector is used to identify and reconstruct\nelastic scattering events, determining both the initial lepton energy and the\nsign of the scattered lepton. The data were collected in two days with a\nprimary electron beam energy of only 3.3 GeV, limiting the data from this run\nto smaller values of $Q^2$ and scattering angle. Nonetheless, this measurement\nyields a data sample for $e^\\pm p$ with statistics comparable to those of the\nbest previous measurements. We have shown that we can cleanly identify elastic\nscattering events and correct for the difference in acceptance for electron and\npositron scattering.

State-of-the-art BIQA\nmethods typically require subjects to score a large number of images to train a\nrobust model. However, the acquisition of image quality scores has several\nlimitations: 1) scores are not precise, because subjects are usually uncertain\nabout which score most precisely represents the perceptual quality of a given\nimage; 2) subjective judgements of quality may be biased by image content; 3)\nthe quality scales between different distortion categories are inconsistent;\nand 4) it is challenging to obtain a large scale database, or to extend\nexisting databases, because of the inconvenience of collecting sufficient\nimages, training the subjects, conducting subjective experiments, and\nrealigning human quality evaluations. To combat these limitations, this paper\nexplores and exploits preference image pairs such as \"the quality of image Ia\nis better than that of image Ib\" for training a robust BIQA model. The\npreference label, representing the relative quality of two images, is generally\nprecise and consistent, and is not sensitive to image content, distortion type,\nor subject identity; such PIPs can be generated at very low cost. The proposed\nBIQA method is one of learning to rank. We first formulate the problem of\nlearning the mapping from the image features to the preference label as one of\nclassification. In particular, we investigate the utilization of a multiple\nkernel learning algorithm based on group lasso (MKLGL) to provide a solution. A\nsimple but effective strategy to estimate perceptual image quality scores is\nthen presented. Experiments show that the proposed BIQA method is highly\neffective and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art BIQA\nalgorithms. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily extended to new\ndistortion categories.\n"]}]

The receiver side is another microcontroller coupled\nto an inductive coil that gets the data and displays in the LCD. A brief\nbackground to IPT Inductive Power Transfer technology and its applications is\ngiven and the design criteria for the paper are defined in detail. To be\naccurate, IPT data communication helps to reduce unnecessary wire connections\nand data is transmitted without any touch. Further the paper can be enhanced by\nlooking for fault analysis inside the motor. This can be done by analyzing\nvarious parameters of the motor. A novel two-way IPT communication system was\ndesigned, which worked on the concept of pulsing the system on and off to send\ndata serially. The paper involves transmission of data through inductive flux\nwithout any contact between the two modules. Further as no frequency tunings or\nany calibration is required between different modules a single system can be\nused with multiple clients. This reduces a lot of hazards such as interference\nwith other modules and RF transmitters in the vicinity.\n","Comment: 6 Pages"]}]

Targeting the ecliptic would potentially facilitate unique\nscience that was not possible in the nominal Mission, notably from the study of\nclusters that are significantly brighter than those in the Kepler field. Our\nconclusions are based on predictions of 2-wheel observations made by a space\nphotometry simulator, with information provided by the Kepler Project used as\ninput to describe the degraded pointing scenarios. We find that elevated levels\nof frequency-dependent noise, consistent with the above scenarios, would have a\nsignificant negative impact on our ability to continue asteroseismic studies of\nsolar-like oscillators in the Kepler field. However, the situation may be much\nmore optimistic for observations in the ecliptic, provided that pointing resets\nof the spacecraft during regular desaturations of the two functioning reaction\nwheels are accurate at the < 1 arcsec level. This would make it possible to\napply a post-hoc analysis that would recover most of the lost photometric\nprecision.
