The class of models includes as special\ncases two previously-studied models of language dynamics, the Naming Game, in\nwhich agents tend to standardise on variants they have encountered most\nfrequently, and the Utterance Selection Model, in which agents tend to preserve\nvariability by uniform sampling of a pool of utterances. We reduce the full\ncomplexities of the dynamics to a single-coordinate stochastic model which\nallows the probability and time taken for speakers to reach consensus on a\nsingle variant to be calculated for large communities.

These different regimes\nare observed in simulations of the full dynamics, and for which the simplified\nmodel in some cases makes good quantitative predictions.

In his seminal Philadelphia Notes published in\n1978, M. Auslander introduced the concept of morphisms being determined by\nmodules. Auslander was very passionate about these ivestigations (they also\nform part of the final chapter of the Auslander-Reiten-Smaloe book and could\nand should be seen as its culmination), but the feedback until now seems to be\nsomewhat meager. The theory presented by Auslander has to be considered as an\nexciting frame for working with the category of A-modules, incorporating all\nwhat is known about irreducible maps (the usual Auslander-Reiten theory), but\nthe frame is much wider and allows for example to take into account families of\nmodules - an important feature of module categories. What Auslander has\nachieved is a clear description of the poset structure of the category of\nA-modules as well as a blueprint for interrelating individual modules and\nfamilies of modules. Auslander has subsumed his considerations under the\nheading of \"morphisms being determined by modules\". Unfortunately, the wording\nin itself seems to be somewhat misleading, and the basic definition may look\nquite technical and unattractive, at least at first sight. This could be the\nreason that for over 30 years, Auslander's powerful results did not gain the\nattention they deserve. The aim of this survey is to outline the general\nsetting for Auslander's ideas and to show the wealth of these ideas by\nexhibiting many examples.\n"]}]

In particular, there are many applications that are ``free''\nto the user, but depend on advertisement services for their revenue. Such\napplications include an advertisement module - a library provided by the\nadvertisement service - that can collect a user's sensitive information and\ntransmit it across the network. Users accept this business model, but in most\ncases the applications do not require the user's acknowledgment in order to\ntransmit sensitive information. Therefore, such applications' behavior becomes\nan invasion of privacy. In our analysis of 1,188 Android applications' network\ntraffic and permissions, 93% of the applications we analyzed connected to\nmultiple destinations when using the network. 61% required a permission\ncombination that included both access to sensitive information and use of\nnetworking services.

In an effort to enable users to control the transmission\nof their private information, we propose a system which, using a novel\nclustering method based on the HTTP packet destination and content distances,\ngenerates signatures from the clustering result and uses them to detect\nsensitive information leakage from Android applications. Our system does not\nrequire an Android framework modification or any special privileges. Thus users\ncan easily introduce our system to their devices, and manage suspicious\napplications' network behavior in a fine grained manner.

The first steps are\ncurrently accomplished with the appearance of smart meters or the development\nof more efficient energy storage devices. However, the design of the\ndecentralized information system of the smart grid, which will have to deal\nwith huge amounts of sensor's data in order to control the system within its\nstability region, seems to be still in search.\n  In the following survey, we concentrate on the telecommunication part of the\nsmart grid system. We begin by identifying different control level in the\nsystem, and we focus on high control levels, which are commonly attributed to\nthe information system. We then define a few concepts of the smart grid and\npresent some interesting approaches using models from the complex system\ntheory. In the last part, we review ongoing works aiming at establishing\ntelecommunication requirements for smart grid applications, and underline the\nnecessity of building accountable models for testing these values.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 15 figures"]}]

On the road to a single-shot 3D movie camera, we are\nworking on solutions to overcome the problem of false line indexing by\nutilizing yet unexploited information. We will present several approaches and\nwill discuss profound information-theoretical questions about the information\nefficiency of 3D sensors.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 7th International Fringe Workshop on Advanced\n  Optical Imaging and Metrology, 2013, N\\\"urtingen, Germany"]}]

The effect of the\npolarization state and a non-perpendicular incidence of the electromagnetic\nwave is taken into account by introduction of an effective excitonic\nsusceptibility and an effective optical width of the quantum wells. This\napproach is applied to consideration of optical properties of structures with a\npre-engineered break of the translational symmetry.

We demonstrate from first principles\nthat axial torsion and torsion trace modes have non-transverse vacuum\npolarization tensors, and become massive as a result. The underlying reasons\nare similar to those responsible for the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) and scaling\nanomalies. Since these are the only torsion components that can couple\nminimally to spin 1/2 particles, the anomalous generation of masses for these\nmodes, naturally of the order of the regulator scale, may help to explain why\ntorsion and its associated effects, including CPT violation in chiral gravity,\nhave so far escaped detection. As a simpler manifestation of the reasons\nunderpinning the ABJ anomaly than triangle diagrams, the vacuum polarization\ndemonstration is also pedagogically useful. In addition it is shown that the\nteleparallel limit of a Weyl fermion theory coupled only to the left-handed\nspin connection leads to a counter term which is the Samuel-Jacobson-Smolin\naction of chiral gravity in four dimensions.\n","Comment: 7 pages, RevTeX file"]}]
