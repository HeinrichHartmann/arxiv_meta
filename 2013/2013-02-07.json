The paper analyzes the tradeoff between the number of\nstates of the universal FSM and the attainable regret. It first studies the\ncase of a small number of states. A class of machines, denoted Degenerated\nTracking Memory (DTM), is defined and the optimal machine in this class is\nshown to be the optimal among all machines for small enough number of states.\nUnfortunately, DTM machines become suboptimal as the number of available states\nincreases.

Following that, an asymptotic lower bound of\nO(k^{-2/3}) on the achievable regret of any k-state machine is derived. This\nbound is attained asymptotically by the EDM machine.

Due to the inability of\nrechargeable energy sources to charge and discharge at the same time, a\nconstraint we term the energy half-duplex constraint, two rechargeable energy\nstorage devices (ESDs) are assumed so that at any given time, there is always\none ESD being recharged. The energy harvesting rate is assumed to be a random\nvariable that is constant over the time interval of interest. A\nsave-then-transmit (ST) protocol is introduced, in which a fraction of time\n{\\rho} (dubbed the save-ratio) is devoted exclusively to energy harvesting,\nwith the remaining fraction 1 - {\\rho} used for data transmission. The ratio of\nthe energy obtainable from an ESD to the energy harvested is termed the energy\nstorage efficiency, {\\eta}. We address the practical case of the secondary ESD\nbeing a battery with {\\eta} < 1, and the main ESD being a super-capacitor with\n{\\eta} = 1. The optimal save-ratio that minimizes outage probability is\nderived, from which some useful design guidelines are drawn.

The diversity order with random power\nis shown to be the same as that of constant power, but the performance gap can\nbe large. Furthermore, we extend the proposed ST protocol to wireless networks\nwith multiple transmitters.

The z -transformed discrete correlation function\n(ZDCF) is a new method for estimating the CCF of sparse, unevenly sampled light\ncurves. Unlike the commonly used interpolation method, it does not assume that\nthe light curves are smooth and it does provide errors on its estimates. The\nZDCF corrects several biases of the discrete correlation function method of\nEdelson & Krolik (1988) by using equal population binning and Fisher's z\n-transform. These lead to a more robust and powerful method of estimating the\nCCF of sparse light curves of as few as 12 points. Two examples of light curve\nanalysis with the ZDCF are presented. 1) The ZDCF estimate of the\nauto-correlation function is used to uncover a correlation between AGN\nmagnitude and variability time scale in a small simulated sample of very sparse\nand irregularly sampled light curves. 2) A maximum likelihood function for the\nZDCF peak location is used to estimate the time-lag between two light curves.\nFortran 77 and 95 code implementations of the ZDCF and the maximum likelihood\npeak location (PLIKE) algorithms are freely available (see\nhttp://www.weizmann.ac.il/weizsites/tal/research/software/).\n","Comment: An expanded description of the ZDCF and PLIKE algorithms\n  (http://www.weizmann.ac.il/weizsites/tal/research/software), posted on\n  astro-ph following requests by users (see main reference: Alexander 1997 \"Is\n  AGN Variability Correlated with Other AGN Properties?
