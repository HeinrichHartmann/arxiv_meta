It is well known that Lasso can estimate the nonparametric\nregression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve\nupon. We show that the OLS post-Lasso estimator performs at least as well as\nLasso in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller\nbias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the Lasso-based model\nselection \"fails\" in the sense of missing some components of the \"true\"\nregression model.

In the extreme case, when Lasso perfectly\nselects the \"true\" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle\nestimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on\nthe dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this\ndimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the \"true\" model.\nOur rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and\nnonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso\nestimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other\nestimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and\ngood sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and\na new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional\nsparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit.

Given a randomness notion R, we ask for which sequences A does\nrelativization to A leave R unchanged (i.e., R^A = R)? Such sequences are call\nlow for R. This question extends to a pair of randomness notions R and S, where\nS is weaker: for which A is S^A still weaker than R? In the last few years,\nmany results have characterized the sequences that are low for randomness by\ntheir low computational strength. A few results have also given\nmeasure-theoretic characterizations of low sequences. For example, Kjos-Hanssen\nproved that A is low for Martin-L\u007f\\\"of randomness if and only if every A-c.e.\nopen set of measure less than 1 can be covered by a c.e. open set of measure\nless than 1. In this paper, we give a series of results showing that a wide\nvariety of lowness notions can be expressed in a similar way, i.e., via the\nability to cover open sets of a certain type by open sets of some other type.\nThis provides a unified framework that clarifies the study of lowness for\nrandomness notions, and allows us to give simple proofs of a number of known\nresults. We also use this framework to prove new results, including showing\nthat the classes Low(MLR;SR) and Low(W2R;SR) coincide, answering a question of\nNies. Other applications include characterizations of highness notions, a\nbroadly applicable explanation for why low for randomness is the same as low\nfor tests, and a simple proof that Low(W2R;S)=Low(MLR;S), where S is the class\nof Martin-L\u007f\\\"of, computable, or Schnorr random sequences. The final section\ngives characterizations of lowness notions using summable functions and\nconvergent measure machines instead of open covers.

We find that entangled two-photon states produced by an atomic\ncascade are indeed capable of enhancing by a large factor the simultaneous\nexcitation probability as compared to uncorrelated photons, as predicted some\nyears ago by Muthukrishnan et al, but that several non-entangled, separable,\ncorrelated states, produced either by an atomic cascade or parametric down\nconversion, or even appropriate combinations of coher- ent states, have\ncomparable efficiencies. We show that the key ingredient for the increase of\nsimultaneous excitation probability is the presence of strong frequency\nanti-correlation and not time correlation nor time-frequency entanglement.\n"]}]
