Present-day properties"],"description":["  We use the Millennium I and II cosmological simulations to revisit the impact\nof mergers in the growth of bulges in central galaxies in the LCDM scenario. We\nseed galaxies within the growing CDM haloes using semi-empirical relations to\nassign stellar and gaseous masses, and an analytic treatment to estimate the\ntransfer of stellar mass to the bulge of the remnant after a galaxy merger. We\nfind that this model roughly reproduces the observed correlation between the\nbulge-to-total (B/T) mass ratio and stellar mass in present-day central\ngalaxies as well as their observed demographics, although low-mass B/T<0.1\n(bulgeless) galaxies might be scarce relative to the observed abundance. In our\nmerger-driven scenario, bulges have a composite population made of (i) stars\nacquired from infalling satellites, (ii) stars transferred from the primary\ndisc due to merger-induced perturbations, and (iii) newly formed stars in\nstarbursts triggered by mergers. We find that (i) and (ii) are the main\nchannels of mass assembly, with the first being dominant for massive galaxies,\ncreating large bulges with different stellar populations than those of the\ninner discs, while the second is dominant for intermediate/low-mass galaxies\ncreating small bulges with similar stellar populations to the inner discs. We\nassociate the dominion of the first (second) channel to classical (pseudo)\nbulges, and compare the predicted fractions to observations. We remark that our\ntreatment does not include other mechanisms of bulge growth such as intrinsic\nsecular disc instabilities or misaligned gas accretion. We find that the\nevolution of the stellar and gaseous contents of the satellite as it moves\ntowards the central galaxy is a key ingredient in setting the morphology of the\nremnant, and that a good match to the observed bulge demographics occurs when\nthis evolution proceeds closely to that of the central galaxy.\n","Comment: Revised version, reduced to 15 pages and 5 figures, accepted for\n  publication in MNRAS"]}]

Here we give\nphysical and analytical arguments showing that the sbottom resonance may\nactually not be there. In particular, we show analytically that the one-loop\ngluon-neutralino scattering amplitude has no pole at m_sbottom=m_chi+m_b, while\nby analytic continuation to the regime m_sbottom<m_chi, it develops a pole at\nm_sbottom=m_chi-m_b.

The pole can be interpreted as the formation of\na sbottom-antibottom-qqq or antisbottom-bottom qqq resonant state (where qqq\nare the nucleon valence quarks), which is kinematically not accessible if the\nneutralino is the LSP. Our analysis shows that the common practice of\nestimating the neutralino-nucleon cross section by introducing an ad-hoc pole\nat m_sbottom=m_chi+m_b into the effective four-fermion interaction (including\nhigher-twist effects) should be discouraged, since it corresponds to adding a\nspurious pole to the scattering process at the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s)\nm_chi m_sbottom-m_b.

In this picture, the vertices of a\nc-causet have integer labels that are unique up to a label isomorphism. This\nlabeling enables us to define a natural metric $d(a,b)$ between time-like\nseparated vertices $a$ and $b$. The time metric $d(a,b)$ results in a natural\ndefinition of a geodesic from $a$ to $b$. It turns out that there can be $n\\ge\n1$ such geodesics.

Jacquier found an asymptotic formula\nfor the implied volatility at small strikes with two terms and also provided an\nincomplete description of the third term. In the present paper, we obtain a new\nasymptotic formula for the left wing of the implied volatility, which is\nqualitatively different from the De Marco-Hillairet-Jacquier formula. The new\nformula contains three explicit terms and an error estimate. We show how to\nderive the De Marco-Hillairet-Jacquier formula from our formula, and compare\nthe performance of the two formulas in the case of the CEV model.

A paper by Poujade & Blanchet in 2002 made great progress by\neffectively reducing the use of such expansions to an algorithmic form. It gave\nsystematic procedures for the development of both near-zone and far-zone\nasymptotic expansions, avoiding the divergent integrals which often bedevilled\nsuch methods, and showed that these two expansions could be made to match\nexactly, a result described there as somewhat remarkable.\n  This paper revisits that work and shows that there is unfortunately an error\nin it which invalidates the results of the matching process as given therein.\nThe present paper identifies that error and shows how it may be corrected to\ngive valid matching results. The correction is presented in a redevelopment\nsomewhat different from that of their paper. This shows that far from being\nsomewhat remarkable, it is in fact inevitable that the match is exact. It is\nindeed remarkable that they could carry both expansions to the point at which\nmatching becomes possible, but if it can be done at all, then the match is\nnecessarily exact.\n  A companion paper will apply this asymptotic matching to a model problem in\nwhich the correct near-zone expansion was obtained by approximation from an\nexact solution.

We show that the statistical hadronization model (SHM) well\ndescribes particle production in QGP hadronization. For all centralities, the\nphysical properties are compatible with the earlier proposed critical\nhadronization pressure suggesting universal hadronization conditions of QGP.\n  Heavy-ion collisions at LHC present a new challenge for SHM in describing\nparticle production at TeV energy scales. We show that the chemical\nnon-equilibrium model gives a good description of the hadron production in\nPb--Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV consistently as a function of centrality.\nMoreover, the model parameters assume expected values suggested by previous\nstudies at lower energies. The quark-gluon plasma fireball hadronizes at the\nsame universal hadronization conditions, that is a common critical pressure,\nentropy and energy density.\n  At LHC energies, a significant amount of charm is expected to be produced and\nit is therefore crucial to incorporate charm into the present description of\nparticle production. We present an upgraded SHARE with CHARM program, that\nquantifies the effect of charm on the yield of lighter hadrons and physical\nproperties of the hadronizing fireball. In addition to light flavors ($u,d,s$),\nSHARE with CHARM describes charm hadron production and decays. We observe, that\naccording to present experimental results, charm decays mainly affect the\nyields of multistrange particles.\n","Comment: 143 pages"]}]

On the top of\nthe rare-earths doped layer, a silicon nitride (SiN) 2D planar PhC is\nsynthesized. For that, SiN is first deposited by PECVD. After holographic\nlithography and reactive ion etching, a periodic square lattice of holes is\ngenerated on the SiN layer. The PhC topographical parameters as well as the\nlayers thickness are optimized using Finite-Difference-Time-Domain simulations.\nThe design and realization of such PhC-assisted down-converter structures is\npresented. Optical simulations demonstrate that the PhC leads to the\nestablishment of resonant modes located in the underneath doped layer, allowing\na drastic enhancement of the absorption of the rare-earth ions without\ndisturbing the transmission in the visible and near-IR parts of the spectrum,\nhence demonstrating the relevance of such an approach.\n","Comment: 28th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference and Exhibition,\n  Paris : France (2013)"]}]

Multiple traps can be coupled through\ncontrollable tunneling barriers or merged altogether. We present analytical\nexpressions for pancake-, cigar-, and ring- shaped traps. The ring-geometry is\nof particular interest for guided matter-wave interferometry as it provides a\nperfectly smooth waveguide of controllable diameter, and thus a tunable\nsensitivity of the interferometer.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Such a class of currents can lead in the field of a\nspinless nucleus to the constitution of a partially ordered set consisting of\ncross sections of polarized and unpolarized neutrino scattering. We discuss a\ntheory, in which flavor conservation is predicted as a theorem about the\nequality of cross sections of the interaction with a gauge boson of leptonic\ncurrent structural components. This theorem relates flavor and mirror\nsymmetries as a consequence of force unification forming the two left-(right-)\nhanded fermions in individual difermions. Thereby, it requires one to follow\nthe logic of a true nature of elementary particles from the point of view of a\nflavor dynamics of all types of micro-world symmetry laws.\n","Comment: 10 pages, LaTex, Published version in J.
