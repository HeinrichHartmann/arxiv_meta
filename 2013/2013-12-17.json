Masses of exotic nuclides impose constraints on models for the\nnuclear interaction and thus affect the description of the equation of state of\nnuclear matter, which can be extended to describe neutron-star matter. With\nknowledge of the masses of nuclides near shell closures, one can also derive\nthe neutron-star crustal composition. The Penning-trap mass spectrometer\nISOLTRAP at CERN-ISOLDE has recently achieved a breakthrough measuring the mass\nof 82Zn, which allowed constraining neutron-star crust composition to deeper\nlayers (Wolf et al., PRL 110, 2013). We perform a more detailed study on the\nsequence of nuclei in the outer crust of neutron stars with input from\ndifferent nuclear models to illustrate the sensitivity to masses and the\nrobustness of neutron-star models. The dominant role of the N=50 and N=82\nclosed neutron shells for the crustal composition is confirmed.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the anniversary issue of Int.

Services of this kind are mainly public or\nsemi-public, often aimed at increasing the attractiveness of non-motorized\nmeans of transportation, and are usually free, or almost free, of charge for\nthe users.

The structure of the\nflow is defined in terms of asymptotically-matched thin-layers, namely the\nsurface layer and a critical layer, whether it is elevated or immersed,\ncorresponding to its location above or within the surface layer. The results\nparticularly demonstrate the physical importance of the singular flow features\nand physical implications of the elevated critical layer in the limit of the\nunsteadiness tending to zero. These agree with the variational mathematical\nsolution of Miles (1957) for small but finite growth rate, but they are not\nconsistent physically or mathematically with his analysis in the limit of\ngrowth rate tending to zero. As this and other studies conclude, in the limit\nof zero growth rate the effect of the elevated critical layer is eliminated by\nfinite turbulent diffusivity, so that the perturbed flow and the drag force are\ndetermined by the asymmetric or sheltering flow in the surface shear layer and\nits matched interaction with the upper region. But for groups of waves, in\nwhich the individual waves grow and decay, there is a net contribution of the\nelevated critical layer to the wave growth. Critical layers, whether elevated\nor immersed, affect this asymmetric sheltering mechanism, but in quite a\ndifferent way to their effect on growing waves.

We prove that the fundamental\nstrict complementarity theorem of linear programming can yield a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a linear system to have a unique least l1-norm\nnonnegative solution.

Motivated by these results, we introduce the concept of the\n`RSP of order K' that turns out to be a full characterization of the uniform\nrecovery of K-sparse nonnegative vectors.

I apply this formalism to two resource cases: platinum group metals\n(PGMs) and water. Assuming for now that only Ni-Fe asteroids are of interest\nfor PGMs, then 1% of NEOs are rich in PGMs. The dearth of ultra-low delta-v\n(<4.5 km s-1) NEOs larger than 100 m diameter reduces the ore-bearing fraction\nto only ~1 in 2000 NEOs. As 100 m diameter NEOs are needed to have a value >=\nUS$1 B and the population of near-Earth objects (NEOs) larger than 100 m\ndiameter is ~20,000 (Mainzer et al. 2011) the total population of PGM\nore-bearing NEOs is roughly 10. I stress that this is a conservative and highly\nuncertain value. For example, an order of magnitude increase in PGM ore-bearing\nNEOs occurs if delta-v can as large as 5.7 km s-1. Water ore for utilization in\nspace is likely to be found in ~1/1100 NEOs. NEOs as small as 18 m diameter can\nbe water-ore-bodies because of the high richness of water (~20%) expected in\n~25% of carbonaceous asteroids, bringing the number of water-ore-bearing NEOs\nto ~9000 out of the 10 million NEOs of this size.

These estimates are at present highly imprecise and\nsensitive to small changes, especially in the maximum delta-v allowed.\nNonetheless the low values found here mean that much improved determinations of\neach of the terms of the formalism are urgently needed. If better estimates\nstill find small numbers of ore-bearing NEOs then thorough surveys for NEA\ndiscovery and, especially, characterization are needed.
