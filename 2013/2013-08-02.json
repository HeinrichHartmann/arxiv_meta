From these graphs, many assembly\nalgorithms first detect simple local graph structures (motifs), such as tips\nand bubbles, mainly to find sequencing errors. These motifs are easy to detect,\nbut they are sometimes too simple to deal with more complex errors. The\nsuperbubble is an extension of the bubble, which is also important for\nanalyzing assembly graphs.

This attempt, which is far from being complete, is characterized by\ntwo milestones, the Standard Model of the elementary particles and the\nEinstein's theory of General Relativity. The coupling of a quantum field\ntheory, such as the Standard Model, to a weak gravitational background provides\nsignificant information concerning the coupling of matter to gravity and allows\nto study in a systematic way the origin of the conformal anomaly. For this\nreason, the computation of correlation functions in a weak gravitational\nbackground is of remarkable interest and the consequences of this analysis are\nalso of phenomenological relevance. For instance, they concern the appearance\nin the spectrum of the theory of a composite state, the dilaton, which is\nidentified, in perturbation theory, by an infrared coupled anomaly pole. The\nstudy of some applications of the methods discussed so far is presented in the\nsecond part of this thesis. In particular it is shown that the analysis of the\nclassical metric perturbations in gravity can be related to some specific field\ntheories via a holographic mapping. This requires the computation of\ncorrelators of energy-momentum tensors in $d=3$ dimensions and plays a role in\nthe study of the non-gaussianities of the cosmic background radiation in the\nearly universe.

The need for\nnovel, energy-efficient photonic and optoelectronic devices will only increase.\nThis work unites fundamental physics and a novel computational inverse design\napproach towards such innovation.\n  The first half of the dissertation is devoted to the physics of\nhigh-efficiency solar cells. As solar cells approach fundamental efficiency\nlimits, their internal physics transforms. Photonic considerations, instead of\nelectronic ones, are the key to reaching the highest voltages and efficiencies.\nProper photon management led to Alta Device's recent dramatic increase of the\nsolar cell efficiency record to 28.3%. Moreover, approaching the\nShockley-Queisser limit for any solar cell technology will require light\nextraction to become a part of all future designs.\n  The second half of the dissertation introduces inverse design as a new\ncomputational paradigm in photonics. An assortment of techniques (FDTD, FEM,\netc.) have enabled quick and accurate simulation of the \"forward problem\" of\nfinding fields for a given geometry. However, scientists and engineers are\ntypically more interested in the inverse problem: for a desired functionality,\nwhat geometry is needed? Answering this question breaks from the emphasis on\nthe forward problem and forges a new path in computational photonics. The\nframework of shape calculus enables one to quickly find superior, non-intuitive\ndesigns. Novel designs for optical cloaking and sub-wavelength solar cell\napplications are presented.\n","Comment: 137 pages, 55 figures. PhD thesis, Electrical Engineering, Berkeley\n  (2012)"]}]

The\nkey idea is to learn discriminative linear transformations for face images\nusing matrix rank as the optimization criteria. The learned linear\ntransformations restore a shared low-rank structure for faces from the same\nsubject, and, at the same time, force a high-rank structure for faces from\ndifferent subjects. In this way, among the transformed faces, we reduce\nvariations caused by domain changes within the classes, and increase\nseparations between the classes for better face recognition across domains.\nExtensive experiments using public datasets are presented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach for face recognition across domains. The\npotential of the approach for feature extraction in generic object recognition\nand coded aperture design are discussed as well.\n"]}]

We\npropose a Gaussian Process (GP) model for sparse representation to optimize the\ndictionary objective function. The sparse coding property allows a kernel with\ncompact support in GP to realize a very efficient dictionary learning process.\nHence we can describe an action video by a set of compact and discriminative\naction attributes.
