The radio power varies roughly as the square of the global\nSZ signal, but when the SZ signal is scaled to within the radio halo radius the\ncorrelation becomes approximately linear, with reduced intrinsic scatter.

The\ncombination of the very low mass function and such a short orbital period is\nunique. The discoverers suggested that the progenitor system could be an\nultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB), which is a binary with a sub-hour orbital\nperiod in which a (semi-)degenerate donor fills its Roche lobe and transfers\nmass to a neutron star. The standard gravitational-wave driven UCXB scenario,\nhowever, cannot produce a system like PSR J1719-1438 as it would take longer\nthan the age of the Universe to reach an orbital period of 131 min. We\ninvestigate two modifications to the standard UCXB evolution that may resolve\nthis discrepancy. The first involves significant heating and bloating of the\ndonor by pulsar irradiation, and in the second modification the system loses\norbital angular momentum via a fast stellar wind from the irradiated donor,\nadditional to the losses via the usual gravitational wave radiation. In\nparticular a donor wind is effective in accelerating orbital expansion, and\neven a mild wind could produce the 131 minute period within the age of the\nUniverse.

We here\npresent an analysis of the time-delay distribution of multiply imaged sources\nbehind 17 strong lensing galaxy clusters with well-calibrated mass models.

The resultant probability distribution\nfunction enables us to estimate the time-delay distribution in a lensing\ncluster of known mass. For a cluster with M_250=2 x 10^14 M_sun, the fraction\nof time delays less than 1000 days is approximately 3%. Taking Abell 1689 as an\nexample, its dark halo and brightest galaxies, with central velocity\ndispersions larger than 500 km/s, mainly produce large time delays, while\ngalaxy-scale mass clumps are responsible for generating smaller time delays. We\nestimate the probability of observing multiple images of a supernova in the\nknown images of Abell 1689. A two-component model of estimating the supernova\nrate is applied in this work.

In this work, we aim to extend the\npseudopotential LB model to simulate multiphase flows at large density ratio\nand relatively high Reynolds number. First, based on our recent work [Li et\nal., Phys. Rev. E. 86, 016709 (2012)], an improved forcing scheme is proposed\nfor the multiple-relaxation-time pseudopotential LB model in order to achieve\nthermodynamic consistency and large density ratio in the model. Next, through\ninvestigating the effects of the parameter a in the Carnahan-Starling equation\nof state, we find that the interface thickness is approximately proportional to\n1/sqrt(a). Using a smaller a will lead to a wider interface thickness, which\ncan reduce the spurious currents and enhance the numerical stability of the\npseudopotential model at large density ratio. Furthermore, it is found that a\nlower liquid viscosity can be gained in the pseudopotential model by increasing\nthe kinematic viscosity ratio between the vapor and liquid phases. The improved\npseudopotential LB model is numerically validated via the simulations of\nstationary droplet and droplet oscillation. Using the improved model as well as\nthe above treatments, numerical simulations of droplet splashing on a thin\nliquid film are conducted at a density ratio in excess of 500 with Reynolds\nnumbers ranging from 40 to 1000.

A cosmic-variance-limited experiment measuring temperature anisotropy of\nthe cosmic microwave background up to $\\ell_{\\rm max}=2000$ is able to measure\nthese coefficients down to $\\delta c_0=4.4$, $\\delta c_1=61$, and $\\delta\nc_2=13$ (68% CL). We also find that $c_0$ and $c_1$, and $c_0$ and $c_2$, are\nnearly uncorrelated. Measurements of these coefficients will open up a new\nwindow into the physics of inflation such as the existence of vector fields\nduring inflation or non-trivial symmetry structure of inflaton fields. Finally,\nwe show that the original form of the Suyama-Yamaguchi inequality does not\napply to the case involving higher-spin fields, but a generalized form does.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 6 figures.

We use high-quality observations from CRISP at the SST to investigate\nsigns of these different kinetic modes in spicules on the disk. Earlier, rapid\nblue-shifted excursions (RBEs), short-lived absorption features in the blue\nwing of chromospheric spectral lines, were identified as the disk counterpart\nof type II spicules. Here we report the existence of similar absorption\nfeatures in the red wing of the Ca II 8542 and Halpha lines: rapid red-shifted\nexcursions (RREs). RREs are found over the whole solar disk and are located in\nthe same regions as RBEs: in the vicinity of magnetic field concentrations.\nRREs have similar characteristics as RBEs: they have similar lengths, widths,\nlifetimes, and average Doppler velocity. The striking similarity of RREs to\nRBEs implies that RREs are a manifestation of the same physical phenomenon and\nthat spicules harbour motions that can result in a net red-shift when observed\non-disk. We find that RREs are less abundant than RBEs and we interpret the\nhigher number of RBEs and the decreased imbalance towards the limb as an\nindication that field-aligned up-flows have a significant contribution to the\nnet Dopplershift. Most RREs and RBEs are observed in isolation but we find many\nexamples of parallel and touching RRE/RBE pairs which appear to be part of the\nsame spicule. We interpret the existence of these RRE/RBE pairs as signs that\ntorsional motion is an important characteristic of spicules. The fact that most\nRBEs and RREs are observed in isolation agrees with the idea that transversal\nswaying motion is another important kinetic mode.

The aim is to look for possible chemical signatures that might give\ninformation about the formation history of this kinematic group of stars, which\nis suggested to correspond to remnants of disrupted satellites. High-resolution\nspectra were obtained with the FIES spectrograph at the Nordic Optical\nTelescope, La Palma, and were analysed with a differential model atmosphere\nmethod. Comparison stars were observed and analysed with the same method.\nAbundances of chemical elements produced mainly by the s-process are similar to\nthose in the Galactic thin-disc dwarfs of the same metallicity, while\nabundances of chemical elements produced predominantly by the r-process are\noverabundant. The similar elemental abundances are observed in Galactic\nthick-disc stars. The chemical composition together with the kinematic\nproperties and ages of stars in Group3 of the Geneva-Copenhagen survey support\na gas-rich satellite merger scenario as the most likely explanation for the\norigin. The similar chemical composition of stars in Group3 and the thick-disc\nstars might suggest that their formation histories are linked.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics, 2013. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1203.6199"]}]

Aims: We intended to find the X-ray coronal counterpart of the\nchromospheric cycle for i Hor. This represents the first X-ray cycle observed\nin an active star, as well as the paradigm of the first coronal cycles in the\nlife of a solar-like star. Methods: We monitored i Hor with XMM-Newton\nobservations spanning almost two years. The spectra of each observation are fit\nwith two-temperature coronal models to study the long-term variability of the\nstar. Results: We find a cyclic behavior in X-rays very similar to the\ncontemporaneous chromospheric cycle. The continuous chromospheric monitoring\nfor more than three cycle lengths shows a trend toward decreasing amplitude,\napparently modulated by a longer term trend. The second cycle is disrupted\nprior to reaching its maximum, followed by a brief episode of chaotic\nvariability before the cyclic behavior resumes, only to be disrupted again\nafter slightly more than one cycle. Conclusions: We confirm the presence of an\nactivity cycle of ~1.6 yr in i Hor both in X-rays and Ca II H&K. It is likely\nsubject to the modulation of a longer, not yet constrained second cycle. The\n1.6 yr cycle is the shortest coronal one observed to date, and i Hor represents\nthe most active star for which a coronal activity cycle has been found. This\ncycle is probably representative of the first coronal cycles in the life of a\nsolar-like star, at the age when life started on Earth.\n","Comment: Published in A&A letters. 5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

In this way we increase\nthe number of tested partitions and thus we potentially improve the\nsegmentation results. In addition, this space is considerably smaller than the\nspace of all possible partitions, thus we still keep the complexity controlled.\n  Our second goal aims to improve the locality of region merging algorithms,\nwhich usually merge pairs of neighboring regions.

For decades, pathologists have had to learn, understand,\nadopt and implement many new laboratory techniques as they arrived on the\nscene. Pathologists successfully integrate the results of those tests into\nfinal pathology reports that were, and still are, the basis of clinical\ntherapeutic decisions. The molecular methods are different but no more\ndifficult to comprehend in the era of \"kit procedures\". Pathologists have the\nknowledge and expertise to identify particular gene mutations using the\nappropriate molecular tests currently available. This review focuses on the\nmost important recent developments in KRAS mutation testing in metastatic\ncolorectal cancer (CRC), and shows that a pathologist is involved in 10 stages\nof this procedure. Recent studies have shown that highly sensitive, simple,\nreliable and rapid assays may significantly improve the identification of CRC\npatients resistant to anti-EGFR therapy. Thus, direct sequencing does not seem\nto be an optimal procedure of KRAS testing for clinical purposes. Twelve\ncurrently available high-sensitivity diagnostic assays (with the CE-IVD mark)\nfor KRAS mutation testing are briefly described and compared. The suggested\npathology report content for somatic mutation tests is described. In\nconclusion, evidence is presented that sending away paraffin blocks with tumor\ntissue for KRAS mutation testing may not be in the best interest of patients.\nInstead, an evidence-based approach indicates that KRAS mutation testing should\nbe performed in pathology departments, only with the use of CE-IVD/FDA-approved\nKRAS tests, and with the obligatory, periodic participation in the KRAS EQA\nscheme organized by the European Society of Pathology as an independent\ninternational body.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 140 references"]}]

For instance,\nuniquely-defined particle states do not exist in general, in QFT on a curved\nspacetime. More in general, particle states are difficult to define in a\nbackground-independent quantum theory of gravity. These difficulties have lead\nsome to suggest that in general QFT should not be interpreted in terms of\nparticle states, but rather in terms of eigenstates of local operators. Still,\nit is not obvious how to reconcile this view with the empirically-observed\nubiquitous particle-like behavior of quantum fields, apparent for instance in\nexperimental high-energy physics, or \"particle\"-physics. Here we offer an\nelement of clarification by observing that already in flat space there exist\n--strictly speaking-- two distinct notions of particles: globally defined\n$n$-particle Fock-states and *local particle states*. The last describe the\nphysical objects detected by finite-size particle detectors and are eigenstates\nof local field operators. In the limit in which the particle detectors are\nappropriately large, global and local particle states converge in a weak\ntopology (but not in norm). This observation has little relevance for\nflat-space theories --it amounts to a reminder that there are boundary effects\nin realistic detectors--; but is relevant for gravity. It reconciles the two\npoints of view mentioned above. More importantly, it provides a definition of\nlocal particle state that remains well-defined even when the conventional\nglobal particle states are not defined. This definition plays an important role\nin quantum gravity.\n","Comment: 19 pages, no figures. Revised version, with a new title, of the 2004\n  paper \"Global particles, local particles\""]}]
