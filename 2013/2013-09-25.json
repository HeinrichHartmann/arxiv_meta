The gamma-ray luminosity proportional to the 0.5 power of\nthe spin-down power relation is robustly confirmed by all the assumed models\nwith particular agreement in the slot gap (SG) case. On luminosity bases, the\nintermediate altitude emission of the two pole caustic SG model is favoured.\nThe beaming factor shows an spin-down power dependency that is slightly visible\nin theSG case. Estimates of the pulsar orientations have been obtained to\nexplain the simultaneous gamma and radio light-curves. By analysing the\nsolutions we found a relation between the observed energy cutoff and the width\nof the emission slot gap. This relation has been theoretically predicted.

The light-curve\nmorphology study shows that the outer magnetosphere gap emission are favoured\nto explain the observed radio-gamma lag. The light curve moment studies\n(symmetry and sharpness) on the contrary favour a two pole caustic slot gap\nemission. All the model predictions suggest a different magnetic field layout\nwith an hybrid two pole caustic and intermediate altitude emission to explain\nboth the pulsar luminosity and light curve morphology .

The\npresence of these objects typically induces complicated dynamics in the compact\ndimensions such that a full solution to the 10d equations of motion is often\nout of reach. In order to still be able to make statements about the 4d\neffective theory arising in the low-energy limit, the equations of motion are\nusually only solved in an integrated sense, while the backreaction of the\nlocalised sources on the internal fields is neglected. This simplification is\noften referred to as smearing. In this work, we investigate to what extent\nsmearing may affect observables in the effective low-energy theory and whether\nit may lead to fake solutions that would cease to exist once the backreaction\nis properly taken into account. We analyse explicit examples for which smeared\nsolutions exist and find that the reliability of the smeared approximation\nappears to depend on whether or not these solutions saturate a BPS bound.

We show that, under a few general\nassumptions, the backreaction of the fully localised anti-branes yields a\nsingularity in fields that do not directly couple to them, and we give an\nargument suggesting that the singularity is not resolved by brane polarisation.\nWe furthermore demonstrate that, in many string compactifications involving\nnon-trivial background fluxes, the effective lower-dimensional cosmological\nconstant is determined by the on-shell action of the localised sources present\nin the solution. This often allows to compute the cosmological constant without\nresorting to potentially unreliable approximations like smearing.\n","Comment: PhD thesis. 130 pages, 5 figures.

Such simulations are challenging since streaming and deep\npenetration effects are equally important. In order to make such simulations\ntractable, both variance reduction (VR) techniques and parallel computing are\nused. It has been found that the application of VR techniques in such models\nsignificantly reduces the efficiency of parallel computation due to 'long\nhistories'. VR in MCNP can be accomplished using energy-dependent weight\nwindows. The weight window represents an 'average behaviour' of particles, and\nlarge deviations in the arriving weight of a particle give rise to extreme\namounts of splitting being performed and a long history. When running on\nparallel clusters, a long history can have a detrimental effect on the parallel\nefficiency - if one process is computing the long history, the other CPUs\ncomplete their batch of histories and wait idle. Furthermore some long\nhistories have been found to be effectively intractable. To combat this effect,\nCCFE has developed an adaptation of MCNP which dynamically adjusts the WW where\na large weight deviation is encountered. The method effectively 'de-optimises'\nthe WW, reducing the VR performance but this is offset by a significant\nincrease in parallel efficiency. Testing with a simple geometry has shown the\nmethod does not bias the result. This 'long history method' has enabled CCFE to\nsignificantly improve the performance of MCNP calculations for ITER on parallel\nclusters, and will be beneficial for any geometry combining streaming and deep\npenetration effects.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Starting from a\ndescription of individual speculative behaviours, we build and study a second\norder Markov process, which after simple transformations can be viewed as a\nturning two-dimensional Gaussian process. Then, our main problem is to ob- tain\nsome bounds for the persistence rate relative to the return time to a given\nprice. In our main results, we prove with both spectral and probabilistic\nmethods that this rate is almost proportional to the turning frequency {\\omega}\nof the model and provide some explicit bounds. In the continuity of this\nresult, we build some estimators of {\\omega} and of the pseudo-period of the\nprices. At last, we end the paper by a proof of the quasi-stationary\ndistribution of the process, as well as the existence of its persistence rate.\n","Comment: 53 Pages, 8 Figures"]}]
