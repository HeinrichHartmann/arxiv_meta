Aims: We determine if non-ideal MHD, including\nthe effects of ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation determined from a\ndetailed chemical network model, allows for disk formation at the earliest\nstages of star formation (SF). Methods: We employ the axisymmetric thin-disk\napproximation in order to resolve a dynamic range of 9 orders of magnitude in\nlength and 16 in density, while also calculating partial ionization using up to\n19 species in a detailed chemical equilibrium model. MB is applied using a\nsteady-state approximation, and a barotropic relation is used to capture the\nthermal evolution. Results: We resolve the formation of the first and second\ncores, with expansion waves at the periphery of each, a magnetic diffusion\nshock, and prestellar infall profiles at larger radii. Power-law profiles in\neach region can be understood analytically. After the formation of the second\ncore, centrifugal support rises rapidly and a low-mass disk of radius ~10 R_Sun\nis formed, when the second core has mass ~0.001 M_Sun. The mass-to-flux ratio\nis ~10,000 times the critical value in the central region. Conclusions: A small\ncentrifugal disk can form in the earliest stage of SF, due to a shut-off of MB\ncaused by magnetic field dissipation in the first core region. There is enough\nangular momentum loss to allow the second collapse to occur directly, and a\nlow-mass stellar core to form with a surrounding disk. The disk mass and size\nwill depend upon how the angular momentum transport mechanisms within the disk\ncan keep up with mass infall onto the disk.

After discussing some of the early challenges in the\nfield, I describe the experimental picture provided by a variety of\nspectroscopic and transport techniques. Then I turn to the technique of neutron\nscattering, and discuss how it is used to determine spin correlations,\nespecially in model systems of quantum magnetism. Neutron scattering and\ncomplementary techniques have determined the extent to which antiferromagnetic\nspin correlations survive in the cuprate superconductors. One experimental case\ninvolves the ordering of spin and charge stripes. I first consider related\nmeasurements on model compounds, such as La(2-x)Sr(x)NiO(4+d), and then discuss\nthe case of La(2-x)Ba(x)CuO(4). In the latter system, recent transport studies\nhave demonstrated that quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity coexists with\nthe stripe order, but with frustrated phase order between the layers. This has\nled to new concepts for the coexistence of spin order and superconductivity.\nWhile the relevance of stripe correlations to high-temperature\nsuperconductivity remains a subject of controversy, there is no question that\nstripes are an intriguing example of electron matter that results from strong\ncorrelations.\n","Comment: 74 pages, 76 figs; Lecture notes for the Seventeenth Training Course\n  in the Physics of Strongly Correlated Systems, Vietri sul Mare, Italy,\n  October 2011; to be published in AIP Conf.

It is a precondition to using a graph model for routing that\nall edges have weights. Weights that capture travel times and GHG emissions can\nbe extracted from GPS trajectory data collected from the network.

The underlying assumption is that electrons are in their\nquantum-mechanical ground state or in thermal equilibrium. However, there is an\nabundance of cases where this is unjustified because the system is only locally\nin equilibrium. In particular, the fractional charges of atoms, clusters, or\nsolids tend to not only depend on atomic positions but also on how the system\nreached its state. For example, the charge of an isolated solid -- and thus the\nforces between atoms in that solid -- usually depends on the counterbody with\nwhich it has last formed contact. Similarly, the charge of an atom, resulting\nfrom the dissociation of a molecule, can differ for different solvents in which\nthe dissociation took place. In this paper we demonstrate that such\ncharge-transfer history effects can be accounted for by assigning discrete\noxidation states to atoms. With our method, an atom can donate an integer\ncharge to another, nearby atom to change its oxidation state as in a redox\nreaction.

The PA model approach\nconsiders the limited mobility range of N. fulva, that is, the grid cell\ndynamics are not strongly in uenced by non-adjacent cells. The model determines\nthe rate of growth of colonies of N. fulva under distinct cell spatial\narchitecture.
