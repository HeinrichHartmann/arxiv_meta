In extensions of the standard model allowing for the\npresence of DeltaNnu equivalent neutrinos (or dark radiation), Neff is\ngenerally >3. The canonical results are reconsidered here, revealing that a\nmeasurement of Neff>3 can be consistent with DeltaNnu=0 (dark radiation without\ndark radiation). Conversely, a measurement consistent with Neff=3 is not\ninconsistent with the presence of dark radiation (DeltaNnu>0). In particular,\nif there is a light WIMP that annihilates to photons after the SM neutrinos\nhave decoupled, the photons are heated beyond their usual heating from e+-\nannihilation, reducing the late time ratio of neutrino and photon temperatures\n(and number densities), leading to Neff<3. This opens the window for one or\nmore equivalent neutrinos, including sterile neutrinos, to be consistent with\nNeff=3. By reducing the neutrino number density at present, this allows for\nmore massive neutrinos, relaxing the current constraints on the sum of the\nneutrino masses. In contrast, if the light WIMP only couples to the SM\nneutrinos and not to the photons, its late time annihilation heats the\nneutrinos but not the photons, resulting in Neff>3 even in the absence of\nequivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. A measurement of Neff>3 is thus no\nguarantee of the presence of equivalent neutrinos or dark radiation. In the\npresence of light WIMPs and/or equivalent neutrinos there are degeneracies\namong the light WIMP mass and its nature (fermion or boson, as well as its\ncouplings to neutrinos or photons), the number and nature (fermion or boson) of\nthe equivalent neutrinos, and their decoupling temperature (the strength of\ntheir interactions with the SM particles).

This event was the first ground level\nenhancement (GLE) of solar cycle 24. In this study, we try to identify the\nacceleration source(s) of solar energetic particles by combining in situ\nparticle measurements from the WIND/3DP, GOES 13, and solar cosmic rays\nregistered by several NMs, as well as remote-sensing solar observations from\nSDO/AIA, SOHO/LASCO, and RHESSI. We derive the interplanetary magnetic field\n(IMF) path length (1.25 +/- 0.05 AU) and solar particle release time (01:29 +/-\n00:01 UT) of the first arriving electrons by using their velocity dispersion\nand taking into account contamination effects. We found that the electron\nimpulsive injection phase, indicated by the dramatic change in the spectral\nindex, is consistent with flare non-thermal emission and type III radio bursts.\nBased on the potential field source surface concept, modeling of the open-field\nlines rooted in the active region has been performed to provide escape channels\nfor flare-accelerated electrons.Meanwhile, relativistic protons are found to be\nreleased 10 minutes later than the electrons, assuming their scatter-free\ntravel along the same IMF path length. Combining multi-wavelength imaging data\nof the prominence eruption and coronal mass ejection (CME), we obtain evidence\nthat GLE protons, with an estimated kinetic energy of 1.12 GeV, are probably\naccelerated by the CME-driven shock when it travels to 3.07 solar radii. The\ntime-of-maximum spectrum of protons is typical for shock wave acceleration.\n"]}]

Since the SPI transfer function is sparse, we have used some\npopular methods for the solution of large sparse linear systems; we briefly\nreview these methods. We use the Multifrontal Massively Parallel Solver (MUMPS)\nto compute the solution of the system of equations. We also need to compute the\nvariance of the solution, which amounts to computing selected entries of the\ninverse of the sparse matrix corresponding to our linear system.

Flooding a topographic surface may be modeled as\nflooding a node weighted graph (TG), with unweighted edges, the node weights\nrepresenting the ground level. The progression of a flooding may also be\nmodeled on the region adjacency graph (RAG) of a topographic surface. On a RAG\neach node represents a catchment basin and edges connect neighboring nodes. The\nedges are weighted by the altitude of the pass point between both adjacent\nregions.

We characterize all valid floodings on\nboth types of graphs, as they should verify the laws of hydrostatics. We then\nshow that each flooding of a node weighted graph also is a flooding of an edge\nweighted graph with appropriate edge weights. The highest flooding under a\nceiling function may be interpreted as the shortest distance to the root for\nthe ultrametric flooding distance in an augmented graph. The ultrametric\ndistance between two nodes is the minimal altitude of a flooding for which both\nnodes are flooded. This remark permits to flood edge or node weighted graphs by\nusing shortest path algorithms. It appears that the collection of all lakes of\na RAG has the structure of a dendrogram, on which the highest flooding under a\nceiling function may be rapidly found.\n","Comment: 165 pages, 21 figures"]}]

This method mainly bases on the\nactive set and the quasi-Newton type algorithm, by using the symmetric rank-one\nand negative curvature direction technologies to approximate the Hessian\nmatrix. Our method improves the recent results of those methods in [Pattern\nRecognition, 45(2012)3557-3565; SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 33(6)(2011)3261-3281;\nNeural Computation, 19(10)(2007)2756-2779, etc.]. Moreover, the object function\ndecreases faster than many other NMF methods. In addition, some numerical\nexperiments are presented in the synthetic data, imaging processing and text\nclustering. By comparing with the other six nonnegative matrix approximation\nmethods, our experiments confirm to our analysis.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to PP on Feb. 5, 2013"]}]
