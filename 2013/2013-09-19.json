While the two-flavor effective models may be sufficient\nto describe the phenomenon of pion condensation, it is interesting to study the\nroles of the strangeness degree of freedom and the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly. In\nthis paper, we present a systematic study of the three-flavor\nNambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft (KMT) term that\nmimics the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly at finite isospin chemical potential. In the\nmean-field approximation, the model predicts a phase transition from the vacuum\nto the pion superfluid phase, which takes place at $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ equal to the\npion mass $m_\\pi$. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$ anomaly, the strangeness degree of\nfreedom couples to the light quark degrees of freedom and the strange quark\neffective mass depends on the pion condensate. However, the strange quark\ncondensate and the strange quark effective mass change slightly in the pion\nsuperfluid phase, which verifies the validity of the two-flavor models. The\neffective four-fermion interaction of the Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft term in\nthe presence of the pion condensation is constructed. Due to the U$_{\\rm A}(1)$\nanomaly, the pion condensation generally induces scalar-pseudoscalar\ninteraction. The Bethe-Salpeter equation for the mesonic excitations is\nestablished and the meson mass spectra are obtained at finite isospin chemical\npotential and temperature. Finally, the general expression for the topological\nsusceptibility $\\chi$ at finite isospin chemical potential $\\mu_{\\rm I}$ is\nderived.

We prove that the maximum possible number\nof repeated $d \\times d$-minors in a $d \\times n$ totally-positive matrix is\n$O(n^{d-\\frac{d}{d+1}})$. For the case $d=2$ we also show that our bound is\noptimal. We consider some special families of totally postive matrices to show\nnon-trivial lower bounds on the number of repeated minors. In doing so, we\narrive at a new interesting problem: How many unit-area and axis-parallel\nrectangles can be spanned by two points in a set of $n$ points in the plane?\nThis problem seems to be interesting in its own right especially since it seem\nto have a flavor of additive combinatorics and relate to interesting incidence\nproblems where considering only the topology of the curves involved is not\nenough. We prove an upper bound of $O(n^{\\frac{4}{3}})$ and provide a lower\nbound of $n^{1+\\frac{1}{O(\\log\\log n)}}$.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

Managing human-machine interaction is a problem of\nconsiderable scope, and the simplification of human-robot interfaces is\nespecially important in the domains of biomedical technology and rehabilitation\nmedicine. For example, amputees who control artificial limbs are often required\nto quickly switch between a number of control actions or modes of operation in\norder to operate their devices. We suggest that by learning to anticipate\n(predict) a user's behaviour, artificial limbs could take on an active role in\na human's control decisions so as to reduce the burden on their users.\nRecently, we showed that RL in the form of general value functions (GVFs) could\nbe used to accurately detect a user's control intent prior to their explicit\ncontrol choices. In the present work, we explore the use of temporal-difference\nlearning and GVFs to predict when users will switch their control influence\nbetween the different motor functions of a robot arm. Experiments were\nperformed using a multi-function robot arm that was controlled by muscle\nsignals from a user's body (similar to conventional artificial limb control).\nOur approach was able to acquire and maintain forecasts about a user's\nswitching decisions in real time. It also provides an intuitive and reward-free\nway for users to correct or reinforce the decisions made by the machine\nlearning system. We expect that when a system is certain enough about its\npredictions, it can begin to take over switching decisions from the user to\nstreamline control and potentially decrease the time and effort needed to\ncomplete tasks. This preliminary study therefore suggests a way to naturally\nintegrate human- and machine-based decision making systems.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, This version to appear at The 1st\n  Multidisciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making,\n  Princeton, NJ, USA, Oct. 25-27, 2013"]}]
