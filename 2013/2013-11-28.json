The electronic and\nmechanical properties of CVD-grown graphene depend in large part on the\ncharacteristics of the grain boundaries.

By recording and\nanalyzing the interference patterns, we can map grain boundaries for a large\narea CVD-grown graphene film and probe the electronic properties of individual\ngrain boundaries. Quantitative analysis reveals that grain boundaries form\nelectronic barriers that obstruct both electrical transport and plasmon\npropagation. The effective width of these barriers (~10-20 nm) depends on the\nelectronic screening and it is on the order of the Fermi wavelength of\ngraphene. These results uncover a microscopic mechanism that is responsible for\nthe low electron mobility observed in CVD-grown graphene, and suggest the\npossibility of using electronic barriers to realize tunable plasmon reflectors\nand phase retarders in future graphene-based plasmonic circuits.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Sensor networks have a wide range of applications\nin security and surveillance systems, environmental monitoring, data gathering\nfor network-centric healthcare systems, monitoring seismic activities and\natmospheric events, tracking traffic congestion and air pollution levels,\nlocalization of autonomous vehicles in intelligent transportation systems, and\ndetecting failures of sensing, storage, and switching components of smart\ngrids. The above applications require target tracking for processes and events\nof interest occurring in an environment. Various methods and approaches have\nbeen proposed in order to track one or more targets in a pre-defined area.\nUsually, this turns out to be a complicated job involving higher order\nmathematics coupled with artificial intelligence due to the dynamic nature of\nthe targets. To optimize the resources we need to have an approach that works\nin a more straightforward manner while resulting in fairly satisfactory data.\nIn this paper we have discussed the various cases that might arise while\nflocking a group of sensors to track targets in a given environment. The\napproach has been developed from scratch although some basic assumptions have\nbeen made keeping in mind some previous theories. This paper outlines a\ncustomized approach for feasibly tracking swarms of targets in a specific area\nso as to minimize the resources and optimize tracking efficiency.\n","Comment: 13 Pages, 11 Figures, SAI 2013"]}]

The\nlong-term stability and the behavior of carbyne-rich films under different gas\nexposure have been characterized showing different evolution for different sp\nconfigurations. Our experiments confirm theoretical predictions and demonstrate\nthe possibility of easily producing a stable carbyne-rich pure carbon solid.\nThe stability of the sp2-sp network has important implications for astrophysics\nand for the production of novel carbon-based systems.\n","Comment: RevTeX4, 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PRL"]}]
