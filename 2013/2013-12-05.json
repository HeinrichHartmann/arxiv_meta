High-velocity\noutflows launched shortly after the AGB phase are thought to be the primary\nshaping mechanism of bipolar and multipolar planetary nebulae (PNe). However,\nlittle is known about the launching and driving mechanism for these jets, whose\nmomentum and energy often far exceed the energy that can be provided by\nradiation pressure alone. Here, we report direct evidence of a magnetically\ncollimated jet shaping the bipolar morphology of the circumstellar envelope of\na post-AGB star. We present radio continuum observations of the post-AGB star\nIRAS 15445-5449 which has water masers tracing a fast bipolar outflow.

The SED is consistent with a synchrotron jet\nembedded in a sheath of thermal electrons. We find a close correspondence\nbetween the extent and direction of the synchrotron jet and the bipolar shape\nof the object observed at other wavelenghts, suggesting that the jet is\nresponsible for the source morphology. The jet is collimated by a magnetic\nfield of the order of mG at almost 7000 AU from the central star.

A new Chase-type soft-decision\ndecoding algorithm is proposed, referred to as tree-based Chase-type algorithm.\nThe proposed algorithm takes the set of all vectors as the set of testing\npatterns, and hence definitely delivers the most-likely codeword provided that\nthe computational resources are allowed. All the testing patterns are arranged\nin an ordered rooted tree according to the likelihood bounds of the possibly\ngenerated codewords. While performing the algorithm, the ordered rooted tree is\nconstructed progressively by adding at most two leafs at each trial. The\nordered tree naturally induces a sufficient condition for the most-likely\ncodeword. That is, whenever the proposed algorithm exits before a preset\nmaximum number of trials is reached, the output codeword must be the\nmost-likely one. When the proposed algorithm is combined with Guruswami-Sudan\n(GS) algorithm, each trial can be implement in an extremely simple way by\nremoving one old point and interpolating one new point. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed algorithm performs better than the recently proposed\nChase-type algorithm by Bellorado et al with less trials given that the maximum\nnumber of trials is the same. Also proposed are simulation-based performance\nbounds on the MLD algorithm, which are utilized to illustrate the\nnear-optimality of the proposed algorithm in the high SNR region.

However, identifying\nthe sources (comets, meteorites, and trapped nebular gas) that supplied\nvolatiles to Earth is not straightforward because secondary processes like\nmantle degassing, crustal recycling, and escape to space modified the\ncomposition of the atmosphere. Here, we review two complementary approaches to\ninvestigate the origin of Earth's atmosphere and oceans. The geochemical\napproach uses volatile element abundances and isotopic compositions to identify\nthe possible contributors to the atmosphere and to disentangle the processes\nthat shaped it. In that respect, noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe), elements\nthat are chemically inert and possess several isotopes produced by\nradioactivity, play a critical role. The dynamical approach uses our knowledge\nof planetary dynamics to track volatile delivery to the Earth, starting with\ndust transport in the disk to planet-building processes. The main conclusion is\nthat Earth acquired most of its major volatile elements by accretion of\nplanetesimals or embryos akin to volatile-rich meteorites. At the same time,\nsolar/meteoritic noble gases were captured by embryos and some gases were lost\nto space, by hydrodynamic escape and large impacts. Comets did not contribute\nmuch H, C, and N but may have delivered significant noble gases, which could\nrepresent the only fingerprints of the bombardment of our planet with icy\nbodies. The processes that governed the delivery of volatile elements to the\nEarth are thought to be relatively common and it is likely that Earth-like\nplanets covered with oceans exist in extra-solar systems.\n","Comment: 87 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables.
