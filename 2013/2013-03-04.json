Firstly, it aims to present, in an\neducational and non-technical fashion, the main ideas at the basis of Aerts'\ncreation-discovery view and hidden measurement approach: a fundamental\nexplanatory framework whose importance, in this author's view, has been\nseriously underappreciated by the physics community, despite its success in\nclarifying many conceptual challenges of quantum physics. Secondly, it aims to\nintroduce a new quantum-machine - that we call the delta-quantum-machine -\nwhich is able to reproduce the transmission and reflection probabilities of a\none-dimensional quantum scattering process by a Dirac delta-function potential.\nThe machine is used not only to demonstrate the pertinence of the above\nmentioned explanatory framework, in the general description of physical\nsystems, but also to illustrate (in the spirit of Aerts' epsilon-model) the\norigin of classical and quantum structures, by revealing the existence of\nprocesses which are neither classical nor quantum, but irreducibly\nintermediate. We do this by explicitly introducing what we call the k-model and\nby proving that its processes cannot be modelized by a classical or quantum\nscattering system. The third purpose of this work is to exploit the powerful\nmetaphor provided by our quantum-machine, to investigate the intimate relation\nbetween the concept of potentiality and the notion of non-spatiality, that we\ncharacterize in precise terms, introducing for this the new concept of\nprocess-actuality.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures.

The main aim of this analysis is to understand\nhow the implementation of baryonic physics in simulations affects such\nrelation, i.e. to what extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for\ncluster mass determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of the\nbaryonic physics. In our analysis we use several sets of simulations with\ndifferent physics implemented. Velocity dispersions are determined using three\ndifferent tracers, DM particles, subhalos, and galaxies.\n  We confirm that DM particles trace a relation that is fully consistent with\nthe theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem and with previous\nresults presented in the literature. On the other hand, subhalos and galaxies\ntrace steeper relations, and with larger values of the normalization. Such\nrelations imply that galaxies and subhalos have a $\\sim10$ per cent velocity\nbias relative to the DM particles, which can be either positive or negative,\ndepending on halo mass, redshift and physics implemented in the simulation.\n  We explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely dynamical\nfriction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and galaxies, but not on\nDM particles. These processes appear to be more or less effective, depending on\nthe halo masses and the importance of baryon cooling, and may create a\nnon-trivial dependence of the velocity bias and the $\\soneD$--$\\Mtwo$ relation\non the tracer, the halo mass and its redshift.\n  These results are relevant in view of the application of velocity dispersion\nas a proxy for cluster masses in ongoing and future large redshift surveys.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 16 figures.

Due to their unique\ncoherence properties, Bose-Einstein condensates are ideal sources for an atom\ninterferometer in extended free fall. In this paper we report on the\nrealization of an asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer operated with a\nBose-Einstein condensate in microgravity. The resulting interference pattern is\nsimilar to the one in the far-field of a double-slit and shows a linear scaling\nwith the time the wave packets expand. We employ delta-kick cooling in order to\nenhance the signal and extend our atom interferometer. Our experiments\ndemonstrate the high potential of interferometers operated with quantum gases\nfor probing the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures; 8 pages of supporting material"]}]

One is the critical\ncurve and the other is the transition locus. It is found that the image number\nof the fold is exactly the average value of image numbers on two sides of the\nfold, while the image number of the cusp is equal to the smaller one.

Given a collection of shape priors (a shape dictionary), we define our\nproblem as choosing the right elements and geometrically composing them through\nbasic set operations to characterize desired regions in the image. This\ncombinatorial problem can be relaxed and then solved using classical descent\nmethods. The main component of this relaxation is forming certain compactly\nsupported functions which we call \"knolls\", and reformulating the shape\nrepresentation as a basis expansion in terms of such functions. To select\nsuitable elements of the dictionary, our problem ultimately reduces to solving\na nonlinear program with sparsity constraints. We provide a new sparse\nnonlinear reconstruction technique to approach this problem. The performance of\nproposed technique is demonstrated with some standard imaging problems\nincluding image segmentation, X-ray tomography and diffusive tomography.\n"]}]

For\nexample, the Ginzburg--Landau equation is a normal form that describes pattern\nformation due to the appearance of a single mode of instability in a wide\nvariety of dissipative problems. In a similar vein, a certain \"single-wave\nmodel\" arises in many physical contexts that share common pattern forming\nbehavior. These systems have Hamiltonian structure, and the single-wave model\nis a kind of Hamiltonian mean-field theory describing the patterns that form in\nphase space. The single-wave model was originally derived in the context of\nnonlinear plasma theory, where it describes the behavior near threshold and\nsubsequent nonlinear evolution of unstable plasma waves. However, the\nsingle-wave model also arises in fluid mechanics, specifically shear-flow and\nvortex dynamics, galactic dynamics, the XY and Potts models of condensed matter\nphysics, and other Hamiltonian theories characterized by mean field\ninteraction. We demonstrate, by a suitable asymptotic analysis, how the\nsingle-wave model emerges from a large class of nonlinear advection-transport\ntheories. An essential ingredient for the reduction is that the Hamiltonian\nsystem has a continuous spectrum in the linear stability problem, arising not\nfrom an infinite spatial domain but from singular resonances along curves in\nphase space whereat wavespeeds match material speeds (wave-particle resonances\nin the plasma problem, or critical levels in fluid problems). The dynamics of\nthe continuous spectrum is manifest as the phenomenon of Landau damping when\nthe system is ...

Requiring program- mers to signal\nthreads explicitly results in many concurrency bugs due to missed\nnotifications, or notifications on wrong condition variables. In this paper, we\ndescribe an implementation of an au- tomatic signaling monitor in Java called\nAutoSynch that eliminates such concurrency bugs by removing the burden of\nsignaling from the programmer. We show that the belief that automatic signaling\nmonitors are prohibitively expensive is wrong. For most problems, programs\nbased on AutoSynch are almost as fast as those based on explicit signaling. For\nsome, AutoSynch is even faster than explicit signaling because it never uses\nsignalAll, whereas the programmers end up using signalAll with the explicit\nsignal mechanism. AutoSynch achieves efficiency in synchronization based on\nthree novel ideas. We introduce an operation called globalization that enables\nthe predicate evaluation in every thread, thereby reducing context switches\nduring the execution of the program. Secondly, AutoSynch avoids signalAll by\nusing a property called relay invari- ance that guarantees that whenever\npossible there is always at least one thread whose condition is true which has\nbeen signaled. Finally, AutoSynch uses a technique called predicate tagging to\nefficiently determine a thread that should be signaled. To evaluate the effi-\nciency of AutoSynch, we have implemented many different well- known\nsynchronization problems such as the producers/consumers problem, the\nreaders/writers problems, and the dining philosophers problem.
