Presheaves on $P(P)$ are called $P$-propertopic\nsets. For $0 \\leq n \\leq \\infty$ we define and study $n$-time categorified\n$P$-algebras as $P$-propertopic sets with some lifting properties. Taking\nappropriate PROPs $P$, we obtain higher categorical versions of polycategories,\n2-fold monoidal categories, topological quantum field theories, and so on.\n"]}]
