The expression\nwas obtained utilizing the analogy between electrostatic and elastic theory\nproblems. The main idea lies in similarity of behavior of point charge electric\nfield and the strain field induced by point inclusion in the matrix. This opens\na way to simplify the structure of the expression for the strain tensor. In the\nsolution, the strain distribution consists of contributions related to faces\nand edges of the inclusion. A contribution of each face is proportional to the\nsolid angle at which the face is seen from the point where the strain is\ncalculated. A contribution of an edge is proportional to the electrostatic\npotential which would be induced by this edge if it is charged with a constant\nlinear charge density. The solution is valid for the case of inclusion having\nthe same elastic constants as the matrix. Our method can be applied also to the\ncase of semi-infinite matrix with a free surface. Three particular cases of the\ngeneral solution are considered--for inclusions of pyramidal, truncated\npyramidal, and \"hut-cluster\" shape. In these cases considerable simplification\nwas achieved in comparison with previously published solutions.

The\ndiscussion centers around the possible role of two level systems and structural\nglassy components for inducing the observed anomalies. We propose that the\norigin of glassy behavior is due to the dynamics of defects like dislocations\nformed in He-4. Within the developed framework of glassy components in a solid,\nwe give a summary of the results and predictions for the effects that cover the\nmechanical, thermodynamic, viscoelastic, and electro-elastic contributions of\nthe glassy response of solid He-4. Our proposed glass model for solid He-4 has\nseveral implications: (1) The anomalous properties of He-4 can be accounted for\nby allowing defects to freeze out at lowest temperatures. The dynamics of solid\nHe-4 is governed by glasslike (glassy) relaxation processes and the\ndistribution of relaxation times varies significantly between different\ntorsional oscillator, shear modulus, and dielectric function experiments. (2)\nAny defect freeze-out will be accompanied by thermodynamic signatures\nconsistent with entropy contributions from defects. It follows that such\nentropy contribution is much smaller than the required superfluid fraction, yet\nit is sufficient to account for excess entropy at lowest temperatures. (3) We\npredict a Cole-Cole type relation between the real and imaginary part of the\nresponse functions for rotational and planar shear that is occurring due to the\ndynamics of defects. Similar results apply for other response functions. (4)\nUsing the framework of glassy dynamics, we predict low-frequency yet to be\nmeasured electro-elastic features in defect rich He-4 crystals.

At\nlinear level, the photon density is trapped by the effective photon mass and\ngrows exponentially in time due to superradiance.

On the shortcomings of the 2/3 de-aliasing method"],"description":["  The high-order accuracy of Fourier method makes it the method of choice in\nmany large scale simulations. We discuss here the stability of Fourier method\nfor nonlinear evolution problems, focusing on the two prototypical cases of the\ninviscid Burgers' equation and the multi-dimensional incompressible Euler\nequations. The Fourier method for such problems with quadratic nonlinearities\ncomes in two main flavors. One is the spectral Fourier method. The other is the\n2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier method, where one removes the highest 1/3 portion\nof the spectrum; this is often the method of choice to maintain the balance of\nquadratic energy and avoid aliasing errors. Two main themes are discussed in\nthis paper. First, we prove that as long as the underlying exact solution has a\nminimal C^{1+\\alpha} spatial regularity, then both the spectral and the 2/3\npseudo-spectral Fourier methods are stable. Consequently, we prove their\nspectral convergence for smooth solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation and\nthe incompressible Euler equations. On the other hand, we prove that after a\ncritical time at which the underlying solution lacks sufficient smoothness,\nthen both the spectral and the 2/3 pseudo-spectral Fourier methods exhibit\nnonlinear instabilities which are realized through spurious oscillations. In\nparticular, after shock formation in inviscid Burgers' equation, the total\nvariation of bounded (pseudo-) spectral Fourier solutions must increase with\nthe number of increasing modes and we stipulate the analogous situation occurs\nwith the 3D incompressible Euler equations: the limiting Fourier solution is\nshown to enforce L^2-energy conservation, and the contrast with energy\ndissipating Onsager solutions is reflected through spurious oscillations.\n"]}]

The possibility of a connection arises\nin that wormholes, if they exist, might have profound influence on black holes,\ntheir event horizons, and their internal structure. After discussing some\nconnections, we embark on an overview of what can generally be said about\ntraversable wormhole throats. We discuss the violations of the energy\nconditions that typically occur at and near the throat of any traversable\nwormhole and emphasize the generic nature of this result. We discuss the\noriginal Morris-Thorne wormhole and its generalization to a spherically\nsymmetric time-dependent wormhole, and also discuss spherically symmetric\nBrans-Dicke wormholes. We also discuss the relationship with the topological\ncensorship theorem. Finally we turn to a rather general class of wormholes that\npermit explicit analysis: generic static traversable wormholes (without any\nsymmetry). We define the wormhole throat in terms of a 2--dimensional\nconstant-time hypersurface of minimal area. (Zero trace for the extrinsic\ncurvature plus a ``flare--out'' condition.) This enables us to derive\ngeneralized theorems regarding violations of the energy conditions---theorems\nthat do not involve geodesic averaging but nevertheless apply to situations\nmuch more general than the spherically symmetric Morris-Thorne traversable\nwormhole. [For example: the null energy condition (NEC), when suitably weighted\nand integrated over the wormhole throat, must be violated.]\n","Comment: 47 pages; plain LaTeX; uses epsf.sty (nine encapsulated postscript\n  figures).
