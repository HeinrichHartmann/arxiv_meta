We propose\nan amplitude-phase representation of the DT-CWT which, among other things,\noffers a direct explanation for the improvement in the shift-invariance. The\nrepresentation is based on the shifting action of the group of fractional\nHilbert transform (fHT) operators, which extends the notion of arbitrary\nphase-shifts from sinusoids to finite-energy signals (wavelets in particular).\nIn particular, we characterize the shiftability of the DT-CWT in terms of the\nshifting property of the fHTs. At the heart of the representation are certain\nfundamental invariances of the fHT group, namely that of translation, dilation,\nand norm, which play a decisive role in establishing the key properties of the\ntransform. It turns out that these fundamental invariances are exclusive to\nthis group.\n  Next, by introducing a generalization of the Bedrosian theorem for the fHT\noperator, we derive an explicitly understanding of the shifting action of the\nfHT for the particular family of wavelets obtained through the modulation of\nlowpass functions (e.g., the Shannon and Gabor wavelet). This, in effect, links\nthe corresponding dual-tree transform with the framework of windowed-Fourier\nanalysis.

These fast algorithms are generally referred to as\nconstant-time or O(1) algorithms in the image processing literature. Along with\nthe spatial filter, the edge-preserving bilateral filter [Tomasi1998] involves\nan additional range kernel. This is used to restrict the averaging to those\nneighborhood pixels whose intensity are similar or close to that of the pixel\nof interest. The range kernel operates by acting on the pixel intensities. This\nmakes the averaging process non-linear and computationally intensive,\nespecially when the spatial filter is large. In this paper, we show how the\nO(1) averaging algorithms can be leveraged for realizing the bilateral filter\nin constant-time, by using trigonometric range kernels. This is done by\ngeneralizing the idea in [Porikli2008] of using polynomial range kernels. The\nclass of trigonometric kernels turns out to be sufficiently rich, allowing for\nthe approximation of the standard Gaussian bilateral filter. The attractive\nfeature of our approach is that, for a fixed number of terms, the quality of\napproximation achieved using trigonometric kernels is much superior to that\nobtained in [Porikli2008] using polynomials.\n","Comment: Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

The graphical lasso, which involves maximizing the\nGaussian log likelihood subject to an l1 penalty, is a well-studied approach\nfor this task. We begin by introducing a surprising connection between the\ngraphical lasso and hierarchical clustering: the graphical lasso in effect\nperforms a two-step procedure, in which (1) single linkage hierarchical\nclustering is performed on the variables in order to identify connected\ncomponents, and then (2) an l1-penalized log likelihood is maximized on the\nsubset of variables within each connected component. In other words, the\ngraphical lasso determines the connected components of the estimated network\nvia single linkage clustering. Unfortunately, single linkage clustering is\nknown to perform poorly in certain settings. Therefore, we propose the cluster\ngraphical lasso, which involves clustering the features using an alternative to\nsingle linkage clustering, and then performing the graphical lasso on the\nsubset of variables within each cluster. We establish model selection\nconsistency for this technique, and demonstrate its improved performance\nrelative to the graphical lasso in a simulation study, as well as in\napplications to an equities data set, a university webpage data set, and a gene\nexpression data set.\n"]}]

We\nperformed extensive all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to determine\nthe molecular underpinnings of urea-induced RNA denaturation. Urea displays its\ndenaturing power in both secondary and tertiary motifs of the riboswitch (RS)\nstructure. Our simulations reveal that the denaturation of RNA structures is\nmainly driven by the hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions of urea with the\nbases. Through detailed studies of the simulation trajectories, we found that\ngeminate pairs between urea and bases due to hydrogen bonds and stacks persist\nonly ~ (0.1-1) ns, which suggests that urea-base interaction is highly dynamic.\nMost importantly, the early stage of base pair disruption is triggered by\npenetration of water molecules into the hydrophobic domain between the RNA\nbases. The infiltration of water into the narrow space between base pairs is\ncritical in increasing the accessibility of urea to transiently disrupted\nbases, thus allowing urea to displace inter base hydrogen bonds. This\nmechanism, water-induced disruption of base-pairs resulting in the formation of\na \"wet\" destabilized RNA followed by solvation by urea, is the exact opposite\nof the two-stage denaturation of proteins by urea. In the latter case, initial\nurea penetration creates a dry-globule, which is subsequently solvated by water\npenetration leading to global protein unfolding.

Here we implement an\nab-initio Gutzwiller+LDA calculation, and apply it to a classic problem, the\nferromagnetism of bulk bcc Fe, whose nature has attracted recent interest. In\nthe conventional Stoner-Wohlfarth model, the ferromagnetic ordering of iron\nsets in so that the electrons can reduce their mutual Coulomb repulsion at the\nextra cost of some increase of electron kinetic energy. Density functional\ntheory within the spin polarized local density approximation (LDA) has long\nsupported that picture, showing that ferromagnetic alignment causes band\nnarrowing and a corresponding wavefunction localization, whence a kinetic\nenergy increase. However, because of its inadequate treatment of strong\nintra-site correlations for localized d orbitals, LDA cannot be relied upon,\nparticularly when it comes to separately describing fine potential and kinetic\nenergy imbalances. With ab-initio Gutzwiller+LDA, we indeed find that the\neffect of correlations is to dramatically reverse the balance, the\nferromagnetic ordering of Fe in fact causing a decrease of kinetic energy, at\nthe cost of some increase of potential energy. The underlying physical\nmechanism, foreshadowed long ago by Goodenough and others, and more recently\nsupported by LDA+DMFT calculations, is that correlations cause eg and t2g 3d\norbitals to behave very differently. Weakly dispersive eg states are\nspin-polarized and almost localized, while, more than half filled, the t2g are\nbroad band, fully delocalized states. Owing to intra-atomic Hund's rule\nexchange which aligns eg and t2g spins, the propagation of itinerant t2g holes\nis only allowed when different atomic spins are ferromagnetically aligned. We\nthus conclude that double exchange is at work already in the most popular\nferromagnetic metal.\n"]}]

To compare with\nother published spectra of the asteroid, we computed the spectral slope S', and\nstudied any plausible correlation of this quantity with the phase angle\n(alpha). In the case of visible spectra, we find a variation in spectral slope\nof Delta S' = 0.15 +- 0.10 %/10^3 A/degree for 3 < alpha < 18 degrees, in good\nagreement with the values found in the literature for the phase reddening\neffect.

To\nobtain the solution of such a problem, one usually resorts to an iterative\napproach, a gradient descent algorithm, which updates a candidate shape\ngradually deforming it into the optimal shape. Computing the gradient descent\nupdates requires the knowledge of the first variation of the shape energy, or\nrather the first shape derivative. In addition to the first shape derivative,\none can also utilize the second shape derivative and develop a Newton-type\nmethod with faster convergence. Unfortunately, the knowledge of shape\nderivatives for shape energies in image processing is patchy. The second shape\nderivatives are known for only two of the energies in the image processing\nliterature and many results for the first shape derivative are limiting, in the\nsense that they are either for curves on planes, or developed for a specific\nrepresentation of the shape or for a very specific functional form in the shape\nenergy.

Any well behaved transform is also a solution. The problem is\nrelating the coordinates of the transform to observables. In the present case\nthe objective is to find T,R on a stationary frame that has the R be a physical\nobservable for all distances. We do this by working backwards, assuming the\nform of the metric that we desire, with some undetermined coefficients. These\ncoefficients are then related to the partial derivatives of the transform. The\ntransformed coordinates T,R are found by the integration of partial\ndifferential equations in the FLRW variables. We show that dR has the same\nunits as the radial differential of the FLRW metric, which makes it observable.\nWe develop a criterion for how close the transformed T comes to an observable\ntime. Close to the space origin at the present time, T also becomes physical,\nso that the stationary acceleration becomes Newtonian. We show that a galactic\npoint on a R,T plot starts close to the space origin at the beginning, moves\nout to a physical distance and finite time where it can release light that will\nbe seen at the origin at the present time. Lastly, because the observable R has\na finite limit at a finite T for t = 0 where the galactic velocity approaches\nthe light speed, we see that the universe filled with an ideal fluid as seen on\nclocks and rulers on the stationary frame has a finite extent like that of an\nexpanding empty universe, beyond which are no galaxies and no space.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures; Definition of \"physical coordinates\" is\n  simplified, eliminating the need for one assumption.
