Within\nthis framework, Granger causality is redefined as a global index measuring the\ndirected information flow between two time series with time-varying properties.\nBoth theoretical analyses and numerical examples demonstrate that Granger\ncausality is a monotonically increasing function of the temporal resolution\nused in the estimation. This is consistent with the general principle of coarse\ngraining, which causes information loss by smoothing out very fine-scale\ndetails in time and space. Our results confirm that the Granger causality at\nthe finer spatio-temporal scales considerably outperforms the traditional\napproach in terms of an improved consistency between two resting-state scans of\nthe same subject. To optimally estimate the Granger causality, the proposed\ntheoretical framework is implemented through a combination of several\napproaches, such as dividing the optimal time window and estimating the\nparameters at the fine temporal and spatial scales.

The main objective is to\nselect homogeneous pixels in the filtering area through statistical tests\nbetween distributions. This proposal uses the complex Wishart model to describe\nPolSAR data, but the technique can be extended to other models. The weights of\nthe location-variant linear filter are function of the p-values of tests which\nverify the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution and,\ntherefore, can be used to compute a local mean. The test stems from the family\nof (h-phi) divergences which originated in Information Theory. This novel\ntechnique was compared with the Boxcar, Refined Lee and IDAN filters. Image\nquality assessment methods on simulated and real data are employed to validate\nthe performance of this approach.

Thus, taking into account the price impact in option pricing is an\nimportant issue. This issue has been dealt with, to some extent, for illiquid\nmarkets by assuming a continuous process, mainly based on the Brownian motion.\nHowever, the recent financial crisis and its effects on the global stock\nmarkets have propagated the urgent need for more realistic models where the\nstochastic process describing the price trajectories involves random jumps.\nNonetheless, works related to markets with jumps are scant compared to the\ncontinuous ones. In addition, these previous studies do not deal with illiquid\nmarkets. The contribution of this paper is to tackle the pricing problem for\noptions in illiquid markets with jumps as well as the hedging strategy within\nthis context, which is the first of its kind to the best knowledge.\n"]}]

Here we report a study of the dielectric\nbreakdown in the narrow gap Mott insulators GaTa$_4$Se$_{8-x}$Te$_x$. We find\nthat the I-V characteristics and the magnitude of the threshold electric field\n(E$_{th}$) do not correspond to a Zener breakdown, but rather to an avalanche\nbreakdown. E$_{th}$ increases as a power law of the Mott Hubbard gap (E$_g$),\nin surprising agreement with the universal law E$_{th}$ $\\propto$E$_g$$^{2.5}$\nreported for avalanche breakdown in semiconductors. However, the delay time for\nthe avalanche that we observe in Mott insulators is over three orders of\nmagnitude longer than in conventional semiconductors.

The method achieves high order of accuracy in space together with\nessentially non-oscillatory behavior using a nonlinear WENO reconstruction\noperator on unstructured triangular meshes. High order accuracy in time is\nobtained via a local Lagrangian space-time Galerkin predictor method that\nevolves the spatial reconstruction polynomials in time within each element. The\nfinal one-step finite volume scheme is derived by integration over a moving\nspace-time control volume, where the non-conservative products are treated by a\npath-conservative approach that defines the jump terms on the element\nboundaries. The entire method is formulated as an Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian\n(ALE) method, where the mesh velocity can be chosen independently of the fluid\nvelocity.\n  The new scheme is applied to the full seven-equation Baer-Nunziato model of\ncompressible multi-phase flows in two space dimensions. The use of a Lagrangian\napproach allows an excellent resolution of the solid contact and the resolution\nof jumps in the volume fraction. The high order of accuracy of the scheme in\nspace and time is confirmed via a numerical convergence study. Finally, the\nproposed method is also applied to a reduced version of the compressible\nBaer-Nunziato model for the simulation of free surface water waves in moving\ndomains. In particular, the phenomenon of sloshing is studied in a moving water\ntank and comparisons with experimental data are provided.\n"]}]

Oversampling Strategies"],"description":["  In this paper, we propose oversampling strategies in the Generalized\nMultiscale Finite Element Method (GMsFEM) framework. The GMsFEM, which has been\nrecently introduced in [12], allows solving multiscale parameter-dependent\nproblems at a reduced computational cost by constructing a reduced-order\nrepresentation of the solution on a coarse grid. The main idea of the method\nconsists of (1) the construction of snapshot space, (2) the construction of the\noffline space, and (3) construction of the online space (the latter for\nparameter-dependent problems). In [12], it was shown that the GMsFEM provides a\nflexible tool to solve multiscale problems with a complex input space by\ngenerating appropriate snapshot, offline, and online spaces. In this paper, we\ndevelop oversampling techniques to be used in this context (see [19] where\noversampling is introduced for multiscale finite element methods). It is known\n(see [19]) that the oversampling can improve the accuracy of multiscale\nmethods. In particular, the oversampling technique uses larger regions (larger\nthan the target coarse block) in constructing local basis functions. Our\nmotivation stems from the analysis presented in this paper which show that when\nusing oversampling techniques in the construction of the snapshot space and\noffline space, GMsFEM will converge independent of small scales and\nhigh-contrast under certain assumptions. We consider the use of multiple\neigenvalue problem to improve the convergence and discuss their relation to\nsingle spectral problems that use oversampled regions. The oversampling\nprocedures proposed in this paper differ from those in [19]. In particular, the\noversampling domains are partially used in constructing local spectral\nproblems. We present numerical results and compare various oversampling\ntechniques in order to complement the proposed technique and analysis.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 5 figures"]}]

A set of orthogonal components are sequentially\nconstructed to account for the variation of the categorical outcome, and\ntogether build up a generalized linear model (GLM). This algorithm can be\nconsidered as an extension of the partial least squares (PLS) for GLMs, but\novercomes several issues of existing extensions based on iteratively reweighted\nleast squares (IRLS). First, existing extensions construct a different set of\ncomponents at each iteration and thus cannot provide a convergent set of\ncomponents. Second, existing extensions are computationally intensive because\nof repetitively constructing a full set of components. Third, although they\npursue the convergence of regression coefficients, the resultant regression\ncoefficients may still diverge especially when building logistic regression\nmodels. GOCRE instead sequentially builds up each orthogonal component upon\nconvergent construction, and simultaneously regresses against these orthogonal\ncomponents to fit the GLM. The performance of the new method is demonstrated by\nboth simulation studies and a real data example.\n"]}]
