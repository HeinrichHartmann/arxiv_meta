The\nexperiment includes a sophisticated, off-axis, near detector, the ND280,\nsituated 280 m downstream of the neutrino production target in order to measure\nthe properties of the neutrino beam and to understand better neutrino\ninteractions at the energy scale below a few GeV. The data collected with the\nND280 are used to study charged- and neutral-current neutrino interaction rates\nand kinematics prior to oscillation, in order to reduce uncertainties in the\noscillation measurements by the far detector. A key element of the near\ndetector is the ND280 electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal), consisting of active\nscintillator bars sandwiched between lead sheets and read outwith multi-pixel\nphoton counters (MPPCs). The ECal is vital to the reconstruction of neutral\nparticles, and the identification of charged particle species. The ECal\nsurrounds the Pi-0 detector (P0D) and the tracking region of the ND280, and is\nenclosed in the former UA1/NOMAD dipole magnet.

We investigated how these adaptation currents affect\nthe synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient\nadaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model and a biophysically\ndetailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased adaptation\ncurrents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike\nfrequencies, as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are\nnegligible. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of\nconduction delays, with or without adaptation currents.

Chief among them is the\ndevelopment of H storage and H-resistant materials. H segregation or trapping\nat lattice defects, including vacancies, dislocations, grain boundaries, etc,\nplays a crucial role in determining the properties of these materials. Here,\nthrough first-principles simulations, we propose a unified mechanism involving\ncharge transfer induced strain destabilization to understand H segregation\nbehavior at vacancies. We discover that H prefers to occupy interstitials with\nhigh pre-existing charge densities and the availability of such interstitials\nsets the limit on H trapping capacity at a vacancy. Once the maximum H capacity\nis reached, the dominant charge donors switch from the nearest-neighbor (NN) to\nthe next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) metal atoms. Accompanying with this long-range\ncharge transfer, a significant reorganization energy would occur, leading to\ninstability of the H-vacancy complex.

The high speed PIV system\nrecords high speed videos of particle motion with excellent spatial and\ntemporal clarity. The high speed videos are analyzed to measure the\nconcentration and the two-dimensional motion (velocity and trajectory) of\nindividual particles. Data sample rates for velocity vectors are in the range\nof 0.1 to 3 million vectors per second, thereby providing full resolution of\nthe temporal domain of particle velocity. To see and measure particle motion\ninside the flow fields at high particle concentrations, a custom borescope is\ninserted into particle flow fields.\n  The particle tracking technique can measure gas and fluid flow if the\nparticles are small enough (have a low enough Stokes number) to follow the\ngas/fluid flow.

Until now, the largest known structure in our\nUniverse is the Sloan Great Wall (SGW), which is more than 400 Mpc long and\nlocated approximately one billion light-years away. Here we report the\ndiscovery of a structure at least six times larger than the Sloan Great Wall\nthat is suggested by the distribution of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Gamma-ray\nbursts are the most energetic explosions in the Universe. They are associated\nwith the stellar endpoints of massive stars and are found in and near distant\ngalaxies. Therefore, they are very good indicators of the dense part of the\nUniverse containing normal matter. As of July 2012, 283 GRB redshifts have been\nmeasured. If one subdivides this GRB sample into nine radial parts and compares\nthe sky distributions of these subsamples (each containing 31 GRBs), one can\nobserve that the fourth subsample (1.6 < z < 2.1) differs significantly from\nthe others in that many of the GRBs are concentrated in the same angular area\nof the sky. Using the two-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the significance\nof this observation is found to be less than 0.05 per cent. Fourteen out of the\n31 Gamma-Ray Bursts in this redshift band are concentrated in approximately 1/8\nof the sky. The binomial probability to find such a deviation is p=0.0000055.\nThis huge structure lies ten times farther away than the Sloan Great Wall, at a\ndistance of approximately ten billion light-years. The size of the structure\ndefined by these GRBs is about 2000-3000 Mpc, or more than six times the size\nof the largest known object (SGW) in the Universe.\n","Comment: 7th Huntsville Gamma-Ray Burst Symposium, GRB 2013: paper 33 in eConf\n  Proceedings C1304143"]}]
