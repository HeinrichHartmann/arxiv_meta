In the existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry\ncorresponding feature points are used that cannot be found in such images. The\nfirst method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by\nillumination (ICPM - illumination characteristic points' method (PM)). The\nsecond method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents\nfrom epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM - outline tangent PM). These\ntwo methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because\npositions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and\ncorresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is\nlimited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We\nalso consider two more methods which are termed CCPM (curve characteristic PM)\nand CTPM (curve tangent PM), for searching epipolar geometry for images of\nsmooth bodies based on a set of level curves with constant illumination\nintensity. The CCPM method is based on searching correspondent points on\nisophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines.\nThe CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve\nepipolar line to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves\nepipolar line. The standard method (SM) based on knowledge of pairs of the\nalmost exact correspondent points. The methods have been implemented and tested\nby SM on pairs of real images. Unfortunately, the last two methods give us only\na finite subset of solutions including \"good\" solution. Exception is \"epipoles\nin infinity\". The main reason is inaccuracy of assumption of constant\nbrightness for smooth bodies. But outline and illumination characteristic\npoints are not influenced by this inaccuracy.

The spread of multiple image components over a large radial range\nalso allows us to determine the amplitude of the deV and dark matter components\nseparately.

Modelling the star formation\nhistory assuming composite stellar populations at solar metallicity to the\ngalaxy's photometry yields a mass to light ratio of\nM_star,salp/L_B~4.0_{-1.3}^{+0.6}M/L_sun,B and\nM_star,chab/L_B~2.3_{-0.8}^{+0.3}M/L_sun,B for Salpeter and Chabrier IMFs,\nrespectively. Hence, the mass to light ratio derived from lensing is more\nSalpeter-like, in agreement with results for massive Coma galaxies and other\nnearby massive early type galaxies. We examine the consequences of the galaxy\ngroup in which the lensing galaxy is embedded, showing that it has little\ninfluence on the mass to light ratio obtained for the deV component of the\nlensing galaxy. Finally, we decompose the projected, azimuthally averaged 2D\ndensity distribution of the deV and dark matter component of the lensing signal\ninto spherically averaged 3D density profiles. We can show that the 3D dark and\nluminous matter density within R_E~0.6R_eff of this SLACS galaxy is similar to\nthe values of Coma galaxies with the same velocity dispersions.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables, accepted for publication by MNRAS"]}]

This ensures that, of the models\nthat fit well, the least complicated is selected as the best fit.

We prove a Weitzenbock\nformula involving complex basic forms on K\\\"ahler foliations and we apply this\nformula for pointing out some properties of transverse Calabi-Yau structures.\nThis allows us to prove that links provide examples of compact simply-connected\ncontact Calabi-Yau manifolds. Moreover, we show that a simply-connected compact\nmanifold with a K\\\"ahler foliation admits a transverse hyper- K\\\"ahler\nstructure if and only if it admits a compatible transverse hyper-Hermitian\nstructure. This latter result is the \"foliated version\" of a theorem proved by\nVerbitsky.

In this paper we examine whether there\nis a similar effect in human demography. We find that although there is no\nobservable relationship between population density and overall death rates,\nthere is a clear relationship between density and the death rates of young\nage-groups. Basically their death rates decrease with increasing density.\nHowever, this relationship breaks down around 300 inhabitants per square\nkilometre.

However, it should\nbe noted that the strength of the density effect is only a fraction of the\nstrength of the marital status effect.

The existence of greedy embeddings in the\nEuclidean plane R^2 is known for certain graph classes such as 3-connected\nplanar graphs.
