This potential reproduces several\nrelativistic features with higher accuracy than commonly used pseudo-Newtonian\napproaches. The new potential reproduces the exact location of the marginally\nstable, marginally bound, and photon circular orbits, as well as the exact\nradial dependence of the binding energy and the angular momentum of these\norbits. Moreover, it reproduces the orbital and epicyclic angular frequencies\nto better than 6%. In addition, the spatial projections of general trajectories\ncoincide with their relativistic counterparts, while the time evolution of\nparabolic-like trajectories and the pericentre advance of elliptical-like\ntrajectories are both reproduced exactly. We apply this approach to a standard\nthin accretion disc and find that the efficiency of energy extraction agrees to\nwithin 3% with the exact relativistic value, while the energy flux per unit\narea as a function of radius is reproduced everywhere to better than 7%. As a\nfurther astrophysical application we implement the new approach within a\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics code and study the tidal disruption of a\nmain-sequence star by a supermassive black hole. The results obtained are in\nvery good agreement with previous relativistic simulations of tidal disruptions\nin Schwarzschild spacetime. The equations of motion derived from this potential\ncan be implemented easily within existing Newtonian hydrodynamics codes with\nhardly any additional computational effort.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, minor corrections to match version accepted for\n  publication in MNRAS"]}]

However, the\nsame representation and reconstruction framework is not readily applicable in a\nstreaming system: the unknown signal changes over time, and it is measured and\nreconstructed sequentially over small time intervals.\n  In this paper, we discuss two such streaming systems and a homotopy-based\nalgorithm for quickly solving the associated L1-norm minimization programs: 1)\nRecovery of a smooth, time-varying signal for which, instead of using block\ntransforms, we use lapped orthogonal transforms for sparse representation. 2)\nRecovery of a sparse, time-varying signal that follows a linear dynamic model.\nFor both the systems, we iteratively process measurements over a sliding\ninterval and estimate sparse coefficients by solving a weighted L1-norm\nminimization program. Instead of solving a new L1 program from scratch at every\niteration, we use an available signal estimate as a starting point in a\nhomotopy formulation.

This work offers new\ninsights for the interpretation of planetary survey data. Evolution equations\nfor poloidal and toroidal motions include gradients of density, viscosity, and\ntwo normal stress moduli. The poloidal field exhibits gradients in the cubic\ndilation, which couple non-isotropic pressures to the combined deformation\nfield. In contrast, the toroidal field exhibits vorticity gradients with\nmagnitudes proportional to the natural time. This holds even in the absence of\nmaterial gradients. Consequently, viscosity gradients are not required to drive\ntoroidal motions. The toroidal field is governed by an inhomogeneous diharmonic\nequation, exhibiting dynamic shear localization. The strain-energy density for\nthis model, as a function of temperature, is found via thermodynamics. Assuming\nheat transfer with characteristic diffusivity, a radial model parameterized by\nthermomechanical competence is found. Shear dislocations, admissible for\nthermomechanical competence greater than 1/2, are found to coincide with\nsupershear rupture speeds for in-plane (Mode II) cracks. This range of\nthermomechanical competence coincides with depths in the crust, upper mantle\nand transition zone where earthquake foci are observed. Consequently, all\nseismic sources must exhibit some supershearing component.
