We emphasize that the existence of\na genuine stochastic ether drift could be crucial for the emergence of forms of\nself-organization in matter and thus for the whole approach to complexity.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 5 figures.

This fundamental identifiability issue\narises with traffic anomaly detection in backbone networks, and subsumes\ncompressed sensing as well as the timely low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery\ntasks encountered in matrix decomposition problems. Leveraging the ability of\n$\\ell_1$- and nuclear norms to recover sparse and low-rank matrices, a convex\nprogram is formulated to estimate the unknowns. Analysis and simulations\nconfirm that the said convex program can recover the unknowns for sufficiently\nlow-rank and sparse enough components, along with a compression matrix\npossessing an isometry property when restricted to operate on sparse vectors.\nWhen the low-rank, sparse, and compression matrices are drawn from certain\nrandom ensembles, it is established that exact recovery is possible with high\nprobability. First-order algorithms are developed to solve the nonsmooth convex\noptimization problem with provable iteration complexity guarantees. Insightful\ntests with synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the\nnovel approach in unveiling traffic anomalies across flows and time, and its\nability to outperform existing alternatives.\n","Comment: 38 pages, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

The two proposed\nimplementations are substantially different: for DG we leverage techniques that\nare closely related to generalized Riemann solvers; for FD-WENO we construct\nhigher spatial derivatives with central differences. Among multiderivative time\nintegrators, we argue that multistage two-derivative methods have the greatest\npotential for multidimensional applications, because they only require the flux\nfunction and its Jacobian, which is readily available. Numerical results\nindicate that multiderivative methods are indeed competitive with popular\nstrong stability preserving time integrators.\n","Comment: Journal of Scientific Computing"]}]

In many cases, the longitudinal space charge (LSC) is a\ndominant factor that generates the instability. For the highly bright electron\nbeams, the plasma effect is found to be non-trivial in the development of the\ninstability. In this paper, starting from the Vlasov and Poisson equations in\nthe multiple-dimensional phase space, we perform the straightforward analysis\nof the microbunching instability based on the explicit formula of the\nlongitudinal electric field introduced by the density perturbation in the\nlongitudinal direction, in such a way to be highly comparable to the\nwell-developed method for higher energy beams. This method generally applies in\nboth the cases with and without acceleration and independent of lattice\ncomponents. The results show that for a electron beam with small transverse\nemittance at low energies, which is always the case in the injector of a free\nelectron laser device, the plasma effect results in the oscillation of the\nlongitudinal electric field in the modified plasma frequency that depends on\nthe transverse size of the beam, and the Landau damping effect in the\nlongitudinal electric field due to the uncorrelated longitudinal velocity\nspread during the beam transportation. These two effects both play important\nroles in the development of the instability. As the result, the energy\nmodulation driven by the LSC impedance differs from the regular value\nsignificantly and the discrepancy leads to the noticeable change of the final\ngain of the instability.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Requiring\nthat the quantum proper time in the classical limit should reduce to the\nclassical proper time, we propose that only massive particles have Bohmian\ntrajectories.

The operation of the interconnect is based on the\neffect of stress-mediated anisotropy modulation, where an electric field\napplied across the piezoelectric material produces stress, which, in turn,\naffects the anisotropy field in the magnetostrictive material. We present the\nresults of numerical modeling illustrating signal propagation through the\ninterconnect. The model combines electric and magnetic parts, where the\nelectric part describes the distribution of an electric field through the\npiezoelectric and the magnetic part describes the change of magnetization in\nthe magnetoelastic layer. The model is based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nequation with the electric field dependent anisotropy term included. The\nutilization of the electro-magnetic coupling makes it possible to amplify\nmagnetic signal during its propagation via energy conversion from the electric\nto magnetic domains. Potentially, synthetic multiferroic interconnects can be\nimplemented in a variety of spin-based devices ensuring reliable and low-energy\nconsuming data transmission. According to the estimates, the group velocity of\nmagnetic signals may be up to 100 km/s with energy dissipation less than aJ per\nbit per 100nm. The fundamental limits and practical shortcoming of the proposed\napproach are also discussed.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]}]

As a result, Eve cannot obtain any DoF unless it has more\nthan $KN_j$ receive antennas, where $N_j$ is the number of jammer's transmit\nantenna each, and hence $KN_j$ can be regarded as defensible dimensions against\nEve. For the jamming signal alignment at Bob, we propose two opportunistic\njammer selection schemes and find the scaling law of the required number of\njammers for target secure DoF by a geometrical interpretation of the received\nsignals.\n","Comment: Accepted with minor revisions, IEEE Trans. on Signal Processing"]}]

To identify prominent symmetric\nregions which overlap in space and vary in form, the proposed framework is\ndecoupled into a Correspondence Space Voting procedure followed by a\nTransformation Space Mapping procedure. In the correspondence space voting\nprocedure, significant symmetries are first detected by identifying surface\npoint pairs on the input shape that exhibit local similarity in terms of their\nintrinsic geometry while simultaneously maintaining an intrinsic distance\nstructure at a global level. Since different point pairs can share a common\npoint, the detected symmetric shape regions can potentially overlap. To this\nend, a global intrinsic distance-based voting technique is employed to ensure\nthe inclusion of only those point pairs that exhibit significant symmetry. In\nthe transformation space mapping procedure, the Functional Map framework is\nemployed to generate the final map of symmetries between point pairs. The\ntransformation space mapping procedure ensures the retrieval of the underlying\ndense correspondence map throughout the 3D shape that follows a particular\nsymmetry. Additionally, the formulation of a novel cost matrix enables the\ninner product to succesfully indicate the complexity of the underlying symmetry\ntransformation. The proposed transformation space mapping procedure is shown to\nresult in the formulation of a semi-metric symmetry space where each point in\nthe space represents a specific symmetry transformation and the distance\nbetween points represents the complexity between the corresponding\ntransformations.

We found that heavy element abundances influence the sound speed\nand solar neutrinos equally.

We use the Bland-Jensen system\nto determine weak orientability for all matroids on at most nine elements and\nall matroids between ten and twelve elements having rank three. Our experiments\nindicate that for small rank, about half the time, when a simple matroid is not\norientable, it is already non-weakly orientable. Thus, about half of the small\nsimple non-orientable matroids of rank three are not representable over fields\nhaving order congruent to three modulo four. For binary matroids, the\nBland-Jensen linear systems provide a practical way to check orientability.\nSecond, we present two extensions of the Bland-Jensen equations to slightly\nlarger systems of non-linear polynomial equations.

The systems come in two versions, one directly extending the\nBland-Jensen system for GF(2), and a different system working over other\nfields.

Management using data distribution algorithms,\nrather than management using tables, has been proposed in recent research. In\nalgorithm management, data are distributed in accordance with a data\ndistribution algorithm that is capable of determining, on the basis of the\ndatum ID, the node in which the required data is being stored. Among the\nrequirements for a data distribution algorithm are short calculation times, low\nmemory consumption, uniform data distribution in accordance with the capacity\nof each node and the ability to handle the addition or removal of nodes. This\npaper presents a data distribution algorithm called ASURA (Advanced Scalable\nand Uniform storage by Random number Algorithm), which satisfies these\nrequirements. It offers roughly 0.6-{\\mu}s calculation time, kilobyte-order\nmemory consumption, less than 1% maximum variability between nodes in data\ndistribution, data distribution in accordance with the capacity of each node\nand optimal data movement to maintain data distribution in accordance with node\ncapacity when nodes are added or removed. ASURA is contrasted in this paper\nqualitatively and quantitatively with representative data distribution\nalgorithms: Consistent Hashing and Straw Buckets in CRUSH. The comparison\nresults show that ASURA can achieve the same storage cluster capacity as\nConsistent Hashing with dozens fewer nodes by virtue of the uniformity of its\ndistribution with the same level calculation time. They also show that the\nexecution time of ASURA is shorter than that of Straw Buckets in CRUSH. The\nresults reveal that ASURA is the best algorithm for large-scale storage cluster\nsystems.\n","Comment: I post this article to IEEE TPDS simultaneously"]}]

A\ngeneral formula is established for the mismatch capacity of a general channel,\ndefined as a sequence of conditional distributions with a general decoding\nmetrics sequence. We deduce an identity between the Verd\\'{u}-Han general\nchannel capacity formula, and the mismatch capacity formula applied to Maximum\nLikelihood decoding metric. Further, several upper bounds on the capacity are\nprovided, and a simpler expression for a lower bound is derived for the case of\na non-negative decoding metric. The general formula is specialized to the case\nof finite input and output alphabet channels with a type-dependent metric. The\nclosely related problem of threshold mismatched decoding is also studied, and a\ngeneral expression for the threshold mismatch capacity is obtained. As an\nexample of threshold mismatch capacity, we state a general expression for the\nerasures-only capacity of the finite input and output alphabet channel.

In this paper, we develop a framework to predict\nmobile Apps that are most likely to be used regarding the current device status\nof a smartphone. Such an Apps usage prediction framework is a crucial\nprerequisite for fast App launching, intelligent user experience, and power\nmanagement of smartphones. By analyzing real App usage log data, we discover\ntwo kinds of features: The Explicit Feature (EF) from sensing readings of\nbuilt-in sensors, and the Implicit Feature (IF) from App usage relations. The\nIF feature is derived by constructing the proposed App Usage Graph (abbreviated\nas AUG) that models App usage transitions. In light of AUG, we are able to\ndiscover usage relations among Apps. Since users may have different usage\nbehaviors on their smartphones, we further propose one personalized feature\nselection algorithm. We explore minimum description length (MDL) from the\ntraining data and select those features which need less length to describe the\ntraining data. The personalized feature selection can successfully reduce the\nlog size and the prediction time. Finally, we adopt the kNN classification\nmodel to predict Apps usage. Note that through the features selected by the\nproposed personalized feature selection algorithm, we only need to keep these\nfeatures, which in turn reduces the prediction time and avoids the curse of\ndimensionality when using the kNN classifier.
