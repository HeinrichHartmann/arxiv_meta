We\nshow that the subpulse period (P3) is constant on timescales of days, months\nand years, and between 14-5100 MHz. Despite this, the shapes of the driftbands\nchange radically with frequency. Previous studies have concluded that, while\nthe subpulses appear to move through the pulse window approximately linearly at\nlow frequencies (< 500 MHz), a discrete step of 180 degrees in subpulse phase\nis observed at higher frequencies (> 820 MHz) near to the peak of the average\npulse profile.

The former case\ncorresponds to a probability distribution, while the latter gives a possibility\nassignment on X. The study of such assignments and their properties falls\nwithin the purview of possibility theory [DP88, Y80, Z783. It, like probability\ntheory, assigns values between 0 and 1 to express likelihoods of outcomes.\nHere, however, the similarity ends. Possibility theory uses the maximum and\nminimum functions to combine uncertainties, whereas probability theory uses the\nplus and times operations. This leads to very dissimilar theories in terms of\nanalytical framework, even though they share several semantic concepts. One of\nthe shared concepts consists of expressing quantitatively the uncertainty\nassociated with a given distribution. In probability theory its value\ncorresponds to the gain of information that would result from conducting an\nexperiment and ascertaining an actual result. This gain of information can\nequally well be viewed as a decrease in uncertainty about the outcome of an\nexperiment. In this case the standard measure of information, and thus\nuncertainty, is Shannon entropy [AD75, G77]. It enjoys several advantages-it is\ncharacterized uniquely by a few, very natural properties, and it can be\nconveniently used in decision processes. This application is based on the\nprinciple of maximum entropy; it has become a popular method of relating\ndecisions to uncertainty. This paper demonstrates that an equally integrated\ntheory can be built on the foundation of possibility theory. We first show how\nto define measures of in formation and uncertainty for possibility assignments.\nNext we construct an information-based metric on the space of all possibility\ndistributions defined on a given domain. It allows us to capture the notion of\nproximity in information content among the distributions. Lastly, we show that\nall the above constructions can be carried out for continuous\ndistributions-possibility assignments on arbitrary measurable domains. We\nconsider this step very significant-finite domains of discourse are but\napproximations of the real-life infinite domains. If possibility theory is to\nrepresent real world situations, it must handle continuous distributions both\ndirectly and through finite approximations. In the last section we discuss a\nprinciple of maximum uncertainty for possibility distributions. We show how\nsuch a principle could be formalized as an inference rule. We also suggest it\ncould be derived as a consequence of simple assumptions about combining\ninformation. We would like to mention that possibility assignments can be\nviewed as fuzzy sets and that every fuzzy set gives rise to an assignment of\npossibilities. This correspondence has far reaching consequences in logic and\nin control theory. Our treatment here is independent of any special\ninterpretation; in particular we speak of possibility distributions and\npossibility measures, defining them as measurable mappings into the interval\n[0, 1]. Our presentation is intended as a self-contained, albeit terse summary.\nTopics discussed were selected with care, to demonstrate both the completeness\nand a certain elegance of the theory. Proofs are not included; we only offer\nillustrative examples.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in\n  Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]}]

This can be explained as a\nconsequence of the different stellar rotation rates that characterize both\ntypes of stars. In addition, there are similar trends when the accretion rate\nis related to the near-IR colours and disk masses, suggesting that viscous\naccretion disk models are able to explain these trends for both T Tauri and\nHerbig Ae/Be stars. However, there are two major differences between cool and\nhot PMS objects. First, the inner gas dissipation timescale, as estimated by\nrelating the accretion rates and the stellar ages, is slightly faster for\nHerbig Ae/Be stars. This could have implications on the physical mechanism able\nto form planets around objects more massive than the Sun. Second, the relative\nposition of Herbig Ae/Bes with disks showing signs of inner dust clearing in\nthe accretion rate--disk mass plane contrasts with that of transitional T Tauri\nstars, when both samples are compared with \"classical\", non-evolved disks.

Over the last twenty years, these two sources were also the target of\nseveral X-ray observatories (e.g. ROSAT, ASCA, RXTE, BeppoSAX, Chandra, Suzaku,\nXMM-Newton and Swift). While the ratios of the average gamma-ray fluxes between\nEGRET and Fermi observations are 22.9 +/- 1.9 and 12.6 +/- 1.5, their estimated\n2-10 keV X-ray flux do not show such dramatic variations. The X-ray emission\nfrom such flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) are believed to be due to\nsynchrotron self Compton, while gamma-rays originate from inverse\nComptonization of external soft photons from an accretion disk and/or broad\nline region. We argue that in this scenario, the only explanation for the\nuncorrelated variability is that there was an order of magnitude decrease in\nthe external soft photons, while the jet parameters remained more or less\nconstant. This result indicates that perhaps the accretion and jet processes\nare not tightly coupled in these sources.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, to appear in MNRAS"]}]

These templates have been divided in patches sorted in\ndecreasing galaxy density with a fixed number of pixels (we considered patches\nhaving 32, 64 and 128 pixels) and the cross correlation has been performed\nindependently for each of these patches. We find that the densest patch shows a\nstrong temperature decrement in the Q, V, W bands of WMAP and in the 143 GHz\nchannel of Archeops, but not in the 217 GHz channel. Furthermore, we find that\nthe spectral behavior of the amplitude of this decrement is compatible with\nthat expected for the non-relativistic thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, and\nis incompatible (at 4.5 sigma level) with the null hypothesis of having only\nCMB, noise and a dust component (nu^2) in those pixels. We find that the first\n32-pixel sized patch samples the cores of 11 known massive nearby galaxy\nclusters. Under the assumption that the decrement found in this patch is due\nentirely to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, we obtain an average\ncomptonization parameter for those sources of y = (0.41 +- 0.08) x 10^(-4) at\n13 arcmin angular scales. This value is compatible at 1 sigma with the\nexpectation, y = 0.49 x 10^(-4), from a model of the cluster flux number counts\nbased on the standard Lambda-CDM cosmology. The observed value of y is slightly\ndiluted when computed for the first patch of 64 and 128 pixels, presumably due\nto the inclusion of less massive clusters, and the dilution factor inferred is\nalso compatible with the quoted model.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 17 postscript figures, 1 table"]}]

This\nimplies the existence of deviations of an averaged model from the standard\nFriedmann-Lemaitre cosmologies. We quantify these deviations, encoded in a\nbackreaction parameter, in the framework of Newtonian cosmology. We employ the\nlinear theory of gravitational instability in the Eulerian and Lagrangian\napproaches, as well as the spherically- and plane-symmetric solutions as\nstandards of reference. We propose a model for the evolution of the average\ncharacteristics of a spatial domain for generic initial conditions that\ncontains the spherical top-hat model and the planar collapse model as exact sub\ncases. A central result is that the backreaction term itself, calculated on\nsufficiently large domains, is small but, still, its presence can drive the\ncosmological parameters on the averaging domain far away from their global\nvalues of the standard model. We quantify the variations of these parameters in\nterms of the fluctuations in the initial data as derived from the power\nspectrum of initial cold dark matter density fluctuations.
