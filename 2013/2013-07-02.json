The reason is that the\nbasic hypothesis underlying population synthesis (a fixed proportionality\nbetween the number of stars in the different evolutionary phases) is not\nfulfilled in these clusters due to their small number of stars. This incomplete\nsampling of the stellar mass function results in a non-gaussian distribution of\nthe mass-luminosity ratio for clusters that share the same evolutionary\nconditions (age, metallicity and initial stellar mass distribution function).\nWe review some tests that can be carried out a priori to check whether a given\ncluster can be analysed with the fully-sampled standard population synthesis\nmodels, or, on the contrary, a probabilistic framework must be used.

We compute\nphotoionization models that broadly describe the results of the simulations and\ncompare them with photoionization grids. Results. Our main results are: (a) A\nlarge number of low mass clusters (80% for Mclus = 100 Mo) are unable to form\nan H ii region. (b) There are a few overluminous stellar clusters that form H\nii regions. These overluminous clusters preserve statistically the mean value\nof <Q(H0)> obtained by synthesis models, but the mean value cannot be used as a\ndescription of particular clusters.

Although variations in the upper mass limit,\nmup, of the IMF would reproduce the effects of IMF sampling, we find that an ad\nhoc law that relates mup to Mclus in the modelling of stellar clusters is\nuseless, since: (a) it does not cover the whole range of possible cases, and\n(b) the modelling of stellar clusters with an IMF is motivated by the need to\nderive the global properties of the cluster: however, in clusters affected by\nsampling effects we have no access to global information of the cluster but\nonly particular information about a few individual stars.\n","Comment: A&A in press"]}]

It is shown that for both the wind\nand the shell models there are two asymptotic solutions for the optical depth\nduring the coasting phase of the outflow. In particular we show that quite\ncounterintuitively a geometrically thin shell may appear as a thick wind for\nphotons propagating inside it. For this reason we introduce notions of photon\nthick and photon thin outflows, which appear more general and better physically\nmotivated with respect to winds and shells. Photosphere of relativistic outflow\nis a dynamic surface. We study its geometry and find that the photosphere of\nphoton thin outflow has always a convex shape, while in the photon thick one it\nis initially convex (there is always a photon thin layer in any outflow) and\nthen it becomes concave asymptotically approaching the photosphere of an\ninfinitely long wind. We find that both instantaneous and time integrated\nobserved spectra are very close to the thermal one for photon thick outflows,\nin line with existing studies. It is our main finding that the photospheric\nemission from the photon thin outflow produces non thermal time integrated\nspectra, which may be described by the Band function well known in the GRB\nliterature.

In this paper, we show that such misalignments arise naturally in\nhigh-resolution simulations in which we follow angular momentum transport and\ninflows from galaxy to sub-pc scales near AGN, triggered either during galaxy\nmergers or by instabilities in isolated disks. Sudden misalignments can\nsometimes be caused by single massive clumps falling into the center slightly\noff-axis, but more generally, they arise even when the gas inflows are smooth\nand trace only global gravitational instabilities. When several nested,\nself-gravitating modes are present, the inner ones can precess and tumble in\nthe potential of the outer modes. Resonant angular momentum exchange can flip\nor re-align the spin of an inner mode on a short timescale, even without the\npresence of massive clumps. We therefore do not expect that AGN and their host\ngalaxies will be preferentially aligned, nor should the relative alignment be\nan indicator of the AGN fueling mechanism. We discuss implications of this\nconclusion for AGN feedback and BH spin evolution. The misalignments may mean\nthat even BHs accreting from smooth large-scale disks will not be spun up to\nmaximal rotation, and so have more modest radiative efficiencies and\ninefficient jet formation.

This differs from the\nfirst-crossing distribution (mass function on the largest self-gravitating\nscale) which is defined cosmologically and which H11 show corresponds to the\nGMC mass function in disks. We derive an analytic equation for the\nlast-crossing distribution that can be used for an arbitrary collapse threshold\nin ISM and cosmological studies.

The only adjustable parameter in the model is the turbulent\nvelocity power spectrum, which in the range p~5/3-2 gives similar results.

The final starburst is\ndominated by in situ star formation, fueled by gas which flows inwards due to\nglobal torques. The resulting high gas density results in rapid star formation.\nThe gas is self gravitating, and forms massive (~10^10 M_sun) GMCs and\nsubsequent super-starclusters (masses up to 10^8 M_sun). However, in contrast\nto some recent simulations, the bulk of new stars which eventually form the\ncentral bulge are not born in superclusters which then sink to the center of\nthe galaxy, because feedback efficiently disperses GMCs after they turn several\npercent of their mass into stars. Most of the mass that reaches the nucleus\ndoes so in the form of gas. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law emerges naturally as a\nconsequence of feedback balancing gravitational collapse, independent of the\nsmall-scale star formation microphysics.

The proposed function provides an\nextraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with\nMach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex.

As such the parameter T is consistent with\nthe same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure\nfunctions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more\nintermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks.

Thus, we propose a new protocol that\nis not built solely around security but also has efficiency and simplicity\namong its main goals. We propose the Secure Ad Hoc Efficient Routing protocol\n(SAHER) which employs a two-tier architecture based on node clustering. Also,\nwe combine mechanisms like localscale geographic routing, per-node reputation\ntables, credit based alternate route enforcement and cumulative authentication.\nUsing these techniques we examine ways to efficiently defend against the two\nmost common network layer attacks: selective packet dropping and message\nflooding. Further, we consider join/leave operations which have not yet been\nstudied in sufficient depth for sensor networks from a security standpoint. We\nprovide a description of the protocol along with comprehensive experimental\nevaluation under different node distributions, different proportions of\nnon-malicious vs. malicious nodes and different types of activity that\nmalicious nodes could exhibit.\n"]}]

Popular analysis techniques such as clustering and\ninfluential node analysis, require the computation of eigenvectors of the real\ngraph's adjacency matrix. Recent de-anonymization attacks on Netflix and AOL\ndatasets show that an open access to such graphs pose privacy threats. Among\nthe various privacy preserving models, Differential privacy provides the\nstrongest privacy guarantees.\n  In this paper we propose a privacy preserving mechanism for publishing social\nnetwork graph data, which satisfies differential privacy guarantees by\nutilizing a combination of theory of random matrix and that of differential\nprivacy. The key idea is to project each row of an adjacency matrix to a low\ndimensional space using the random projection approach and then perturb the\nprojected matrix with random noise. We show that as compared to existing\napproaches for differential private approximation of eigenvectors, our approach\nis computationally efficient, preserves the utility and satisfies differential\nprivacy. We evaluate our approach on social network graphs of Facebook, Live\nJournal and Pokec. The results show that even for high values of noise variance\nsigma=1 the clustering quality given by normalized mutual information gain is\nas low as 0.74. For influential node discovery, the propose approach is able to\ncorrectly recover 80 of the most influential nodes. We also compare our results\nwith an approach presented in [43], which directly perturbs the eigenvector of\nthe original data by a Laplacian noise. The results show that this approach\nrequires a large random perturbation in order to preserve the differential\nprivacy, which leads to a poor estimation of eigenvectors for large social\nnetworks.\n"]}]

One example is the\nKaye effect which occurs when a thin stream of a solution of polyisobutylene in\nDecalin is poured into a dish of the fluid. As pouring proceeds, a small stream\nof liquid occasionally leaps upward from the heap. This surprising effect,\nwhich lasts only a second or so, is named after its first observer A. Kaye, who\ncould offer no explanation for this behaviour. Later, Collyer and Fischer\nsuggested from 250 frames per second cine recordings that the fluid must be\nhighly shear thinning as well as elastic and 'pituitous'. In addition, they\nconcluded that a rigid surface is required to back the reflected liquid stream.\nWhile the words bouncing and reflection are associated with non-continuous and\nelastic effects, we will show here that the Kaye effect is in fact a continuous\nflow phenomenon. We show that the Kaye effect works for many common fluids,\nincluding shampoos and liquid soaps. We reveal its physical mechanism\n(formation, stability and disruption) through high-speed imaging. The\nmeasurements are interpreted with a simple theoretical model including only the\nshear thinning behaviour of the liquid; elastic properties of the liquid play\nno role. We show that the Kaye effect can be stable and that it can be\ndirected. We even demonstrate a stable Kaye effect on a thin soap film\nexcluding the necessity of a rigid backing surface.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures"]}]
