We aim at studying some possible\nphysical mechanisms contributing to the MZ relation by adopting analytical\nsolutions of chemical evolution models including infall and outflow. We explore\nthe hypotheses of a variable galactic wind rate, infall rate and yield per\nstellar generation (i.e. a variation in the IMF), as possible causes for the MZ\nrelation. By means of analytical models we compute the expected O abundance for\ngalaxies of a given total baryonic mass and gas mass.The stellar mass is\nderived observationally and the gas mass is derived by inverting the Kennicutt\nlaw of star formation, once the star formation rate is known. Then we test how\nthe parameters describing the outflow, infall and IMF should vary to reproduce\nthe MZ relation, and we exclude the cases where such a variation leads to\nunrealistic situations. We find that a galactic wind rate increasing with\ndecreasing galactic mass or a variable IMF are both viable solutions for the MZ\nrelation. A variable infall rate instead is not acceptable. It is difficult to\ndisentangle among the outflow and IMF solutions only by considering the MZ\nrelation, and other observational constraints should be taken into account to\nselect a specific solution. For example, a variable efficiency of star\nformation increasing with galactic mass can also reproduce the MZ relation and\nexplain the downsizing in star formation suggested for ellipticals.

A\ncentral debate concerning the superconducting mechanism is whether the local\nmagnetic moments play an indispensable role or the itinerant electron\ndescription is sufficient. A key step for resolving this issue is to acquire a\ncomprehensive picture regarding the nature of various phases and interactions\nin the iron compounds. Here we report the doping, temperature, and spatial\nevolutions of the electronic structure of NaFe1-xCoxAs studied by scanning\ntunneling microscopy. The spin density wave gap in the parent state is observed\nfor the first time, which shows a strongly asymmetric lineshape that is\nincompatible with the conventional Fermi surface nesting scenario. The\noptimally doped sample exhibits a single, symmetric energy gap, but in the\noverdoped regime another asymmetric gap-like feature emerges near the Fermi\nlevel. This novel gap-like phase coexists with superconductivity in the ground\nstate, persists deep into the normal state, and shows strong spatial\nvariations. The characteristics of the three distinct low energy states, in\nconjunction with the peculiar high energy spectra, suggest that the coupling\nbetween the local moments and itinerant electrons is the fundamental driving\nforce for the phases and phase transitions in the iron pnictides.\n","Comment: 4 figures + supplementary information"]}]

On the basis of the chemical-potential profile of\nglycerol from the extracellular bulk region, throughout PfAQP's conducting\nchannel, to the cytoplasmic bulk region, this study shows the existence of a\nbound state of glycerol inside aquaglyceroporin's permeation pore, from which\nthe dissociation constant is approximately 14 microM.

Here we analyze the principles of security in\ndifferent domains and demonstrate an architectural flaw in current\ncybersecurity. Cybersecurity is inherently weak because it is missing the\nability to defend the overall system instead of individual computers. The\ncurrent architecture enables all nodes in the computer network to communicate\ntransparently with one another, so security would require protecting every\ncomputer in the network from all possible attacks. In contrast, other systems\ndepend on system-wide protections. In providing conventional security, police\npatrol neighborhoods and the military secures borders, rather than defending\neach individual household. Likewise, in biology, the immune system provides\nsecurity against viruses and bacteria using primarily action at the skin,\nmembranes, and blood, rather than requiring each cell to defend itself.

We observe the formation of T1 states following\nbimolecular recombination, indicating that encounters of spin-uncorrelated\nelectrons and holes generate CT states with both spin singlet (1CT) and spin\ntriplet (3CT) characters. We show that triplet exciton formation can be the\nmajor loss mechanism in OPVs. However, we find that even when energetically\nfavoured, the relaxation of 3CT to T1 can be strongly suppressed, via control\nover wavefunction delocalisation, allowing for the dissociation of 3CT back to\nfree changes, thereby reducing recombination and enhancing device performance.\nOur results point towards new design rules for artificial photo-conversion\nsystems, enabling the suppression of electron-hole recombination, and also for\nOLEDs, avoiding the formation of triplet states and enhancing fluorescence\nefficiency.\n","Comment: 4 FIgures"]}]

In this context, model complexity is often\nunknown so that a model order selection step is needed to suitably trade-off\nbias and variance. Recently, a different approach to linear system\nidentification has been introduced, where model order determination is avoided\nby using a regularized least squares framework. In particular, the penalty term\non the impulse response is defined by so called stable spline kernels. They\nembed information on regularity and BIBO stability, and depend on a small\nnumber of parameters which can be estimated from data. In this paper, we\nprovide new nonsmooth formulations of the stable spline estimator. In\nparticular, we consider linear system identification problems in a very broad\ncontext, where regularization functionals and data misfits can come from a rich\nset of piecewise linear quadratic functions. Moreover, our anal- ysis includes\npolyhedral inequality constraints on the unknown impulse response. For any\nformulation in this class, we show that interior point methods can be used to\nsolve the system identification problem, with complexity O(n3)+O(mn2) in each\niteration, where n and m are the number of impulse response coefficients and\nmeasurements, respectively.

While the\nclassical Riemann problem serves as a primary building block in the\nconstruction of many numerical schemes (most notably the Godunov scheme), the\nanalytic study of GRP will lead to an array of GRP schemes, which extend the\nGodunov scheme. Currently there are extensive studies on the second-order GRP\nscheme, which proves to be robust and is capable of resolving complex\nmultidimensional fluid dynamic problems [M. Ben-Artzi and J. Falcovitz,\n\"Generalized Riemann Problems in Computational Fluid Dynamics\", Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 2003]. A more general formulation of the second-order GRP\nsolver is still confined with a class of weakly coupled systems [Numer. Math.\n(2007) 106:369-425]. This paper provides a unified approach for solving the GRP\nin the general context of hyperbolic balance laws, without weakly coupled\nconstraint, towards high order accuracy. The derivation of the second-order GRP\nsolver is more concise compared to those in previous works and the third-order\nquadratic GRP is resolved for the first time. The latter is shown to be\nnecessary through numerical experiments with strong discontinuities. Our method\nrelies heavily on the new treatment of the rarefaction wave by deriving the\nL(Q)-equations, an ODE system capturing the \"evolution\" of the characteristic\nderivatives in x-t space for generalized Riemann invariants. The case of a\nsonic point is incorporated into a general treatment. The accuracy of the\nderived GRP solvers are justified and numerical examples are presented for the\nperformance of the resulting scheme.\n","Comment: 41 pages"]}]
