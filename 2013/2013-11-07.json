The broad lines lag the 5, 8, 15, 22\nand 37 GHz emission. The measured lags $\\tau^{\\rm{uv}}_{\\rm{ob}}$ are of the\norder of years.

Both UV lines have a lag of\n$\\tau^{\\rm{uv}}_{\\rm{ob}}=-2.74^{+0.06}_{-0.25}$ yr relative to the 37 GHz\nemission. These results are consistent with those derived from the Balmer lines\nin Paper I. Second, we derive the time lags of the lines Ly$\\alpha$, CIV,\nH$\\gamma$, H$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ relative to the 37 GHz emission by the FR/RSS\nMonte Carlo method.

This\nstudy is motivated by i) the potential to find bright warm disks around planet\nhost stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and\niii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust\nconcentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at\n12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so\nmost of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We\nidentify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS\n100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have\nthe same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some\nexcesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with\nbackground galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a\nrelatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk\noccurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection\nrate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large\nmid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_\nobs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we\nfind no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we\nattribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence\nthat the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk\npopulation. Higher resolution imaging of stars with excesses is the best way to\nrule out galaxy confusion and identify more reliable disk candidates among\nKepler stars.

We find that both disks are\nconsistent with being aligned with the binary orbital planes. Though secular\nperturbations from the binary can align the disk, in both cases the alignment\ntime at the distances at which the disk is resolved is greater than the stellar\nage, so we conclude that the coplanarity was primordial. Neither disk can be\nmodelled as a narrow ring, requiring extended radial distributions. To satisfy\nboth the Herschel and mid-IR images of the alpha CrB disk, we construct a model\nthat extends from 1-300AU, whose radial profile is broadly consistent with a\npicture where planetesimal collisions are excited by secular perturbations from\nthe binary. However, this model is also consistent with stirring by other\nmechanisms, such as the formation of Pluto-sized objects. The beta Tri disk\nmodel extends from 50-400AU. A model with depleted (rather than empty) inner\nregions also reproduces the observations and is consistent with binary and\nother stirring mechanisms. As part of the modelling process, we find that the\nHerschel PACS beam varies by as much as 10% at 70um and a few % at 100um. The\n70um variation can therefore hinder image interpretation, particularly for\npoorly resolved objects. The number of systems in which circumbinary debris\ndisk orientations have been compared with the binary plane is now four. More\nsystems are needed, but a picture in which disks around very close binaries\n(alpha CrB, beta Tri, and HD 98800, with periods of a few weeks to a year) are\naligned, and disks around wider binaries (99 Her, with a 50 yr period) are\nmisaligned, may be emerging. This picture is qualitatively consistent with the\nexpectation that the protoplanetary disks from which the debris emerged are\nmore likely to be aligned if their binaries have shorter periods.\n","Comment: accepted to MNRAS"]}]

However,\nmethods to quantify the influence of specific individuals on the behaviour of\nother group members and the direction of information flow in moving group, are\nlacking on the level of empirical studies and theoretical models.

Our results show that unlike\nwith classic MBAC or PBAC only schemes, a hybrid approach that combines both\nmethods can simultaneously result in improved admission control and network\nutilization efficiency.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, Journal paper"]}]

We return\nto the idea of two solutions, but in the form of an interpretation of the wave\nfunction based on two different preparations of the quantum system. We\ndemonstrate the necessity of this double interpretation when the particles are\nsubjected to a semi-classical field by studying the convergence of the\nSchr\\\"odinger equation when the Planck constant tends to 0. For this\nconvergence, we reexamine not only the foundations of quantum mechanics but\nalso those of classical mechanics, and in particular two important paradox of\nclassical mechanics: the interpretation of the principle of least action and\nthe the Gibbs paradox. We find two very different convergences which depend on\nthe preparation of the quantum particles: particles called indiscerned\n(prepared in the same way and whose initial density is regular, such as atomic\nbeams) and particles called discerned (whose density is singular, such as\ncoherent states). These results are based on the Minplus analysis, a new branch\nof mathematics that we have developed following Maslov, and on the Minplus path\nintegral which is the analog in classical mechanics of the Feynman path\nintegral in quantum mechanics.

We have found the position of triangular equilibrium\npoints of our problem. The problem is generalised in the sense that smaller\nprimary is supposed to be an oblate spheroid. The bigger primary is considered\nas radiating. The equations of motion are affected by radiation pressure force,\noblateness and P-R drag. All classical results involving photogravitational and\noblateness in restricted three body problem may be verified from this result.\nWith the help of characteristic equation, we discussed the stability. Finally\nwe conclude that triangular equilibrium points are unstable.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Journal of Dynamical Systems & Geometric\n  Theories Vol. 4, Number 1 (2006)"]}]

The VNA process\nequation in the reflection coefficient p of a load, its measurement m and three\nerrors Es -determinable from three standard loads and their measurements- was\nconsidered. Differentials were selected to represent measurement inaccuracies\nand load uncertainties (Differential Errors). The differential operator was\napplied on the process equation and the total differential error dp for any\nunknown load (Device Under Test DUT) was expressed in terms of dEs and dm,\nwithout any simplification. Consequently, the differential error of input\nimpedance Z -or any other physical quantity differentiably dependent on p- is\nexpressible. Furthermore, to express precisely a comparison relation between\ncomplex differential errors, the geometric Differential Error Region and its\nDifferential Error Intervals were defined. Practical results are presented for\nan indoor UHF ground-plane antenna in contrast with a common 50 Ohm DC resistor\ninside an aluminum box. These two built, unshielded and shielded, DUTs were\ntested against frequency under different system configurations and measurement\nconsiderations. Intermediate results for Es and dEs characterize the\nmeasurement system itself. A number of calculations and illustrations\ndemonstrate the application of the method.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 13 figures"]}]
