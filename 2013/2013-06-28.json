Although\nsoftware is often viewed as brittle, with small changes leading to catastrophic\nchanges in behavior, our results show surprising robustness in the face of\nrandom software mutations.\n  The paper describes empirical studies of the mutational robustness of 22\nprograms, including 14 production software projects, the Siemens benchmarks,\nand 4 specially constructed programs.

We find that the three scaling exponents\nobserved in the multiplex data for the friendship, communication and trading\nnetworks can simultaneously be explained by the model.

An approach based on rate-equation\nresults for irreversible aggregation (IA) models is extended to predict several\nscaling regimes in square and triangular lattices, in agreement with simulation\nresults. Consistently with previous works, a regime I with fractal islands is\nobserved at low temperatures, corresponding to IA with critical island size\ni=1, and a crossover to a second regime appears as the temperature is increased\nto \\epsilon R^{2/3} ~ 1, where \\epsilon is the single bond detachment\nprobability and R is the diffusion-to-deposition ratio. In the square\n(triangular) lattice, a regime with scaling similar to IA with i=3 (i=2) is\nobserved after that crossover. In the triangular lattice, a subsequent\ncrossover to an IA regime with i=3 is observed, which is explained by the\nrecurrence properties of random walks in two dimensional lattices, which is\nbeyond the mean-field approaches. At high temperatures, a crossover to a fully\nreversible regime is observed, characterized by a large density of small\nislands, a small density of very large islands, and total island and monomer\ndensities increasing with temperature, in contrast to IA models. CZDs and ISDs\nwith Gaussian right tails appear in all regimes for R ~ 10^7 or larger,\nincluding the fully reversible regime, where the CZDs are bimodal. This shows\nthat the Pimpinelli-Einstein (PE) approach for IA explains the main mechanisms\nfor the large islands to compete for free adatom aggregation in the reversible\nmodel, and may be the reason for its successful application to a variety of\nmaterials and growth conditions.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures"]}]

It affects\nsystems close to the critical (cusp overflowing) configuration. The runaway\neffect depends on the radial profile l(R) of the angular momentum distribution\nof the fluid, on the dimension-less spin a of the central black hole, and other\nfactors, such as self-gravity. Previously it was demonstrated that, for the\npower-law dependence of the radial angular momentum profile, non-magnetized\ntori always become runaway stable for a sufficiently high positive value of q.\nHere we discuss the role of runaway instability within a framework of an\naxially symmetric model of perfect fluid endowed with a purely toroidal\nmagnetic field. The gradual accretion of material over the cusp transfers the\nmass and angular momentum into the black hole, thereby changing the intrinsic\nparameters of the Kerr metric. We studied the effect of the ratio of gas to\nmagnetic pressure and other parameters of the model on the evolution of\ncritical configurations that are just on the verge of cusp overflow. We show\nthat the toroidal magnetic component inside an accretion torus does not change\nthe frequency of its oscillations significantly. We identify these oscillations\nas the radial epicyclic mode. These weak effects can trigger the runaway\ninstability even in situations when the purely hydrodynamical regime of the\ntorus is stable. On the other hand, in most cases the stable configuration\nremains unaffected, and the initial deviations gradually decay after several\norbital periods. We show examples of the torus evolution depending on the\ninitial magnetization beta, the slope q, and the spin a. The toroidal magnetic\nfield plays a more important role in the early phases of the accretion process\nuntil the perturbed configuration finds a new equilibrium or disappears because\nof the runaway instability.\n","Comment: Astronomy and Astrophysics accepted"]}]

Chronos targets the formation and evolution of\ngalaxies, by collecting the deepest NIR spectroscopic data, from the formation\nof the first galaxies at z~10 to the peak of formation activity at z~1-3. The\nstrong emission from the atmospheric background makes this type of survey\nimpossible from a ground-based observatory. The spectra of galaxies represent\nthe equivalent of a DNA fingerprint, containing information about the past\nhistory of star formation and chemical enrichment. The proposed survey will\nallow us to dissect the formation process of galaxies including the timescales\nof quenching triggered by star formation or AGN activity, the effect of\nenvironment, the role of infall/outflow processes, or the connection between\nthe galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes. To provide these data,\nthe mission requires a 2.5m space telescope optimised for a campaign of very\ndeep NIR spectroscopy. A combination of a high multiplex and very long\nintegration times will result in the deepest, largest, high-quality\nspectroscopic dataset of galaxies from z=1 to 12, spanning the history of the\nUniverse, from 400 million to 6 billion years after the big bang, i.e. covering\nthe most active half of cosmic history.\n","Comment: White paper for the science definition of ESA's future L2,L3\n  missions.

Since such large-scale\nstructures are ubiquitous in geo/astrophysical phenomena, the cross-helicity\neffect is expected to play an important role in geo/astrophysical flows. In the\npresence of turbulent cross helicity, the mean vortical motion contributes to\nthe turbulent electromotive force. Magnetic-field generation due to this effect\nis called the cross-helicity dynamo. Several features of the cross-helicity\ndynamo are introduced.

By considering the effects of cross helicity in the\nmomentum equation, we see several interesting consequences of the effect.\nTurbulent cross helicity coupled with the mean magnetic shear reduces the\neffect of turbulent or eddy viscosity.

The higher modes of spine reconnection also\ninclude localized wedges of vortical flux transport in each half of the fan. In\nthis situation, two definitions for reconnection rate become appropriate: a\nlocal reconnection rate quantifying how much flux is genuinely reconnected\nacross the fan plane and a global rate associated with the net flux driven\nacross each semi-plane. Through a scaling analysis it is shown that when the\nohmic dissipation in the layer is assumed to be constant, the increase in the\nlocal rate bleeds from the global rate as the sheet deformation is increased.\nBoth models suggest that asymmetry in the current sheet dimensions will have a\nprofound effect on the reconnection rate and manner of flux transport in\nreconnection involving 3D nulls.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures"]}]

More\nprecisely, we give explicitly all the spherical functions whose associated\nfunctions $H$ are scalar valued, including those of trivial type, and then we\nstudy the irreducible spherical functions of fundamental type, describing them\nin terms of matrix valued hypergeometric functions $_2!F_1$. Thereafter, for\nevery fundamental type we build a sequence of ortogonal matrix valued\npolynomials with respect to a weight $W$, which are associated to the spherical\nfunctions. We also prove that, for any $n$, $W$ admits a second order symmetric\ndifferential operator.\n"]}]

The solution provides an analytic framework that\nexplains all significant dynamical features of Keen's model and their\nparametric dependence, including an exact result for both the period and\nsubsidence rate of the Great Moderation. It emerges that Keen's model has just\ntwo possible long term solutions: stable growth or terminal collapse. While\ncollapse can come about immediately from economies that are nonviable by virtue\nof unsuitable parameters or initial conditions, in general the collapse is\npreceded by an interval of exponential growth. In first approximation, the\nduration of that exponential growth is half a period of a sinusoidal\noscillation. The period is determined by reciprocal of the imaginary part of\none root of a certain quintic polynomial. The real part of the same root\ndetermines the rate of growth of the economy. The coefficients of that\npolynomial depend in a complicated way upon the numerous parameters in the\nproblem and so, therefore, the pattern of roots. For a favorable choice of\nparameters, the salient root is purely real. This is the circumstance that\nadmits the second possible long term solution, that of indefinite stable\ngrowth, i.e. an infinite period.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 12 figures, JEL classification: B50, C62, C63, E12, E47"]}]
