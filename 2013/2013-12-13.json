The MQA scheme is based on the AMQD modulation, which\ngranulates the inputs of the users into Gaussian subcarrier\ncontinuous-variables (CVs). The subcarrier coherent states formulate Gaussian\nsub-channels from the physical link with diverse transmittance coefficients. In\nan AMQD-MQA multiple access scenario, the simultaneous reliable transmission of\nthe users is handled by the dynamic allocation of the Gaussian subcarrier CVs.\nWe propose two different settings of AMQD-MQA for multiple input-multiple\noutput communication. We introduce a rate-selection strategy that tunes the\nmodulation variances and allocates adaptively the quadratures of the users over\nthe sub-channels. We also prove the rate formulas if only partial channel side\ninformation is available for the users of the sub-channel conditions. In an\nexperimental CVQKD scenario, an ideal Gaussian input modulation can only be\napproximated, which affects the quadrature adaption and the efficiency of the\ntransmission. We show a technique for the compensation of a nonideal Gaussian\ninput modulation, which allows the users to overwhelm the modulation\nimperfections to reach optimal capacity-achieving communication over the\nGaussian sub-channels. We investigate the diversity amplification of the\nsub-channel transmittance coefficients and reveal that a strong diversity can\nbe exploited by opportunistic Gaussian modulation.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables"]}]
