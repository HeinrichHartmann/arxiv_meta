We\nconsider the qualitative analysis problems: the computation of the almost-sure\nand limit-sure winning set of states, where player 1 can ensure to win with\nprobability 1 and with probability arbitrarily close to 1, respectively. In\ngeneral the almost-sure and limit-sure winning strategies require both\ninfinite-memory and infinite-precision. We study the bounded-rationality\nproblem for qualitative analysis of concurrent parity games, where the strategy\nset player 1 is restricted to bounded-resource strategies. In terms of\nprecision, strategies can be deterministic, uniform, finite-precision or\ninfinite-precision; and in terms of memory, strategies can be memoryless,\nfinite-memory or infinite-memory. We present a precise and complete\ncharacterization of the qualitative winning sets for all combinations of\nclasses of strategies. In particular, we show that uniform memoryless\nstrategies are as powerful as finite-precision infinite-memory strategies, and\ninfinite-precision memoryless strategies are as powerful as infinite-precision\nfinite-memory strategies. We show that the winning sets can be computed in\nO(n^{2d+3}) time, where n is the size of the game and 2d is the number of\npriorities, and our algorithms are symbolic. The membership problem of whether\na state belongs to a winning set can be decided in NP cap coNP. While this\ncomplexity is the same as for the simpler class of turn-based games, where in\neach state only one of the players has a choice of moves, our algorithms, that\nare obtained by characterization of the winning sets as mu-calculus formulas,\nare considerably more involved.\n"]}]

We point out\nwhich of the observational features of the $\\gamma$-ray sources are important\nto investigate with special care with the planned CTA in order to put a new\nlight on physical processes involved.

For the particular case that the meaning of words is modelled\nwithin a distributional vector space model, its experimental predictions,\nderived from real large scale data, have outperformed other empirically\nvalidated methods that could build vectors for a full sentence. This success\ncan be attributed to a conceptually motivated mathematical underpinning, by\nintegrating qualitative compositional type-logic and quantitative modelling of\nmeaning within a category-theoretic mathematical framework.\n  The type-logic used in the DisCoCat model is Lambek's pregroup grammar.\nPregroup types form a posetal compact closed category, which can be passed, in\na functorial manner, on to the compact closed structure of vector spaces,\nlinear maps and tensor product.

We relax this assumption by\nperforming two-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the\nplasmoid instability during asymmetric inflow magnetic reconnection. Magnetic\nasymmetry modifies the onset, scaling, and dynamics of this instability.\nMagnetic islands develop preferentially into the weak magnetic field upstream\nregion. Outflow jets from individual X-points impact plasmoids obliquely rather\nthan directly as in the symmetric case. Consequently, deposition of momentum by\nthe outflow jets into the plasmoids is less efficient, the plasmoids develop\nnet vorticity, and shear flow slows down secondary merging between islands.\nSecondary merging events have asymmetry along both the inflow and outflow\ndirections. Downstream plasma is more turbulent in cases with magnetic\nasymmetry because islands are able to roll around each other after exiting the\ncurrent sheet. As in the symmetric case, plasmoid formation facilitates faster\nreconnection for at least small and moderate magnetic asymmetries.

The ELM frequency increases by up to a factor of eight\nwith a similar reduction in ELM energy loss. A threshold current for ELM\nmitigation is observed above which the ELM frequency increases approximately\nlinearly with current in the coils. A comparison of the filament structures\nobserved during the ELMs in the natural and mitigated stages shows that the\nmitigated ELMs have the characteristics of type I ELMs even though their\nfrequency is higher, their energy loss is reduced and the pedestal pressure\ngradient is decreased. During the ELM mitigated stage clear lobe structures are\nobserved in visible-light imaging of the X-point region. The size of these\nlobes is correlated with the increase in ELM frequency observed. The RMPs\nproduce a clear 3D distortion to the plasma and it is likely that these\ndistortions explain why ELMs are destabilised and hence why ELM mitigation\noccurs.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 19 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1305.3061"]}]

The radiometric\nmeasurements were performed by a module of four NaI(Tl) crystals of 16 L\nmounted on an autogyro. We applied the collocated cokriging (CCoK) as a\nmultivariate estimation method for interpolating the primary under-sampled\nairborne {\\gamma}-ray data considering the well-sampled geological information\nas ancillary variables. A random number has been assigned to each of 73\ngeological formations identified in the geological map at scale 1:10,000. The\nnon-dependency of the estimated results from the random numbering process has\nbeen tested for three distinct models. The experimental cross-semivariograms\nconstructed for radioelement-geology couples show well-defined co-variability\nstructures for both direct and crossed variograms. The high statistical\ncorrelations among K, eU, and eTh measurements are confirmed also by the same\nmaximum distance of spatial autocorrelation. Combining the smoothing effects of\nprobabilistic interpolator and the abrupt discontinuities of the geological\nmap, the results show a distinct correlation between the geological formation\nand radioactivity content. The contour of Mt. Capanne pluton can be\ndistinguished by high K, eU and eTh abundances, while different degrees of\nradioactivity content identify the tectonic units. A clear anomaly of high K\ncontent in the Mt. Calamita promontory confirms the presence of felsic dykes\nand hydrothermal veins not reported in our geological map. Although we assign a\nunique number to each geological formation, the method shows that the internal\nvariability of the radiometric data is not biased by the multivariate\ninterpolation.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables.

The proposed approach takes away\nmuch of the variability of the network's production traffic that makes it so\ndifficult to classify. This enables the NIDS to detect more subtle attacks\nwhich would not be detected using the passive approach alone. Furthermore, the\nactive probing approach allows the NIDS to be effectively trained using only\nexamples of the network's normal states, hence enabling an effective detection\nof zero-day attacks. Using realistic experiments, we show that an NIDS which\nalso leverages the active approach is considerably more effective in detecting\nattacks which aim to degrade the network's QoS when compared to an NIDS which\nrelies solely on the passive approach.

We predict\nthat a ballistic energy transfer mode, with heat propagation governed by a wave\nequation rather than a diffusion equation, can be realized for a thermal\nelectron-hole plasma in graphene. The new behavior originates from rapid\nexchange of energy and momentum in particle collisions leading to energy\npropagation as a collective weakly-damped oscillation. Due to the electronic\nnature of this mode, the estimated propagation velocity can be ~10^3 times\nlarger than that for previously studied phonon mechanisms. The energy mode is\nuncharged at charge neutrality, but becomes coupled to charge dynamics upon\ndoping. This coupling can be used for all-electric excitation and detection of\nenergy transport.\n","Comment: 4pgs, 1fg"]}]
