By applying this\nto groupoids which represent the (discrete) moduli spaces for topological gauge\ntheory with finite group G, the ETQFT obtained is the untwisted\nDijkgraaf-Witten (DW) model associated to G. This illustrates the factorization\nof TQFT into \"classical field theory\" valued in groupoids, and \"quantization\nfunctors\", which has been described by Freed, Hopkins, Lurie and Teleman.

Next, we prove that the proof\ntechnique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)\nsystems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy\namplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD\nsystem to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane\ntype, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear\ncode of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical\nerror correcting code and our proposed hash function. We also show that a\nsimilar result applies to the quantum wire-tap channel. Finally we compare our\nresults in the two formalisms and show that, in typical QKD scenarios, the\nShor-Preskill--type argument gives better security bounds in terms of the trace\ndistance and Holevo information, than the method based on the \\delta-biased\nfamily.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures; revised argument concerning the relation with\n  the \\delta-biased family"]}]

It\nis thus assumed that different source specific results ((S1/D)di, (S2/D)di)\nwould represent their sources (S1, S2), and be accurately intercomparable.\nHowever, the assumption has never been checked. In this manuscript we carry out\nthis task by considering a system as CO2+-IRMS. We present a model for a priori\npredicting output-uncertainty. Our study shows that scale-conversion, even with\nthe aid of auxiliary-reference-standard(s) Ai(s), cannot make (S/D)di free from\nW; and the ((S/W)di,(A1/W)di,(A2/W)di) To (S/D)di conversion-formula normally\nused in the literature is invalid. Besides, the latter-relation has been worked\nout, which leads to e.g.,\nfJ([(S/W)dJCO2pmp%],[(A1/W)dJCO2pmp%],[(A2/W)dJCO2pmp%]) = ((S/D)dJCO2pm4.5p%);\nwhereas FJ([(S/W)dJCO2pmp%],[(A1/W)dJCO2pmp%]) = ((S/D)dJCO2pm1.2p%). That is,\ncontrary to the general belief (Nature 1978, 271, 534), the scale-conversion by\nemploying one than two Ai-standards should ensure (S/D)di to be more accurate.\nHowever, a more valuable finding is that the transformation of any d-estimate\ninto its absolute value helps improve accuracy, or any reverse-process enhances\nuncertainty. Thus, equally accurate though the absolute-estimates of\nisotopic-CO2 and constituent-elemental-isotopic abundance-ratios could be, in\ncontradistinction any differential-estimate is shown to be less accurate.\nFurther, for S and D to be similar, any absolute estimate is shown to turn out\nnearly absolute accurate but any (S/D)d value as really absurd. That is,\nestimated source specific absolute values, rather than corresponding\ndifferential results, should really represent their sources, and/ or be closely\nintercomparable.\n","Comment: Revision is made with Pictorial illustrations, and/ or with New and\n  General findings: 42 pages (including a clarifying APPENDIX on notations and\n  6 Tables and 3 Figures)"]}]

That is, for any\n2-category K and for any non-negative integer n, we introduce 2-categories\nWdl^{(n)}(K), of (n+1)-tuples of monads in K pairwise related by weak\ndistributive laws obeying the Yang-Baxter equation. The first instance\nWdl^{(0)}(K) coincides with Mnd(K), the usual 2-category of monads in K, and\nfor other values of n, Wdl^{(n)}(K) contains Mnd^{n+1}(K) as a full\n2-subcategory. For the local idempotent closure K^ of K, extending the\nmultiplication of the 2-monad Mnd, we equip these 2-categories with n possible\n`weak wreath product' 2-functors Wdl^{(n)}(K^) --> Wdl^{(n-1)}(K^), such that\nall of their possible n-fold composites Wdl^{(n)}(K^) --> Wdl^{(0)}(K^) are\nequal; i.e. such that the weak wreath product is `associative'. Whenever\nidempotent 2-cells in K split, this leads to pseudofunctors Wdl^{(n)}(K) -->\nWdl^{(n-1)}(K) obeying the associativity property up-to isomorphism. We present\na practically important occurrence of an iterated weak wreath product: the\nalgebra of observable quantities in an Ising type quantum spin chain where the\nspins take their values in a dual pair of finite weak Hopf algebras. We also\nconstruct a fully faithful embedding of Wdl^{(n)}(K^) into the 2-category of\ncommutative n+1 dimensional cubes in Mnd(K^) (hence into the 2-category of\ncommutative n+1 dimensional cubes in K whenever K has Eilenberg-Moore objects\nand its idempotent 2-cells split). Finally we give a sufficient and necessary\ncondition on a monad in K^ to be isomorphic to an n-ary weak wreath product.\n","Comment: 28 pages, LaTeX source v2: Paragraph 2.4 added; references updated"]}]

However,\nDRMG suffers from inherent accuracy restrictions when multiple states are\ninvolved due to multi-state targeting and also the approximate representation\nof the Hamiltonian and other operators. By formulating the variational approach\nof DMRG explicitly for MPSs one can avoid errors inherent in the multi-state\ntargeting approach. Furthermore, by using the Matrix Product Operator (MPO)\nformalism, one can exactly represent the Hamiltonian and other operators. The\nMPO approach allows 1D Hamiltonians to be templated using a small set of finite\nstate automaton rules without reference to the particular microscopic degrees\nof freedom. We present two algorithms which take advantage of these properties:\neMPS to find excited states of 1D Hamiltonians and tMPS for the time evolution\nof a generic time-dependent 1D Hamiltonian. We properly account for\ntime-ordering of the propagator such that the error does not depend on the rate\nof change of the Hamiltonian.

From the perspective of each individual,\nhowever, it is advantageous not to volunteer such contributions, in the hope\nthat other individuals will carry the associated costs. This conflict can be\nmodeled as a volunteer's dilemma. To encourage rational individuals to make\nvoluntary contributions, a government or other social organizations can offer\nrewards, to be shared among the volunteers. Here we apply such shared rewarding\nto the generalized volunteer's dilemma, in which a threshold number of\nvolunteers is required for producing the public good. By means of theoretical\nand numerical analyses, we show that without shared rewarding only two\nevolutionary outcomes are possible: full defection or coexistence of volunteers\nand non-volunteers. We show that already small rewards destabilize full\ndefection, stabilizing small fractions of volunteers instead. Furthermore, at\nthese intermediate reward levels, we find a hysteresis effect such that\nincreasing or decreasing group sizes can trigger different social outcomes. In\nparticular, when group size is increased, the fraction of volunteers first\nincreases gradually before jumping up abruptly; when group size is then\ndecreased again, the fraction of volunteers not only remains high, but even\ncontinues to increase. As the shared reward is increased beyond a critical\nlevel, the bi-stability underlying this hysteresis effect vanishes altogether,\nand only a single social outcome remains, corresponding to the stable\ncoexistence of volunteers and non-volunteers. We find that this critical level\nof shared rewarding is relatively small compared to the total cost of\ncontributing to the public good. These results show that the introduction of\nshared rewarding is remarkably effective in overcoming defection traps in the\ngeneralized volunteer's dilemma.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Journal of Theoretical Biology"]}]

The channel\nresources allocation in multi-carrier multi-access channel, which can greatly\nimprove the system throughput with QoS assurance, thus attracted much attention\nfrom both academia and industry.

The OER determines the relationship of\nthe outage performance among all of the users in the full SNR range, and\nconverges to the diversity-multiplexing region (DMR) when SNR tends to\ninfinity. To achieve the optimal OER and DMR, the random bipartite graph (RBG)\napproach, only depending on 1 bit CSI, will be proposed to formulate this\nproblem. Based on the RBG formulation, the optimal frequency-domain coding\nbased maximum f-matching method is then proposed. By analyzing the\ncombinatorial structure of the RBG based coded f-matching with the help of\nsaddlepoint approximation, the outage probability of each user, OER, and DMR\nwill be derived in closed-form formulas. It will be shown that all of the users\nshare the total multiplexing gain according to their rate requirements, while\nachieving the full frequency diversity, i.e., the optimal OER and DMR.
