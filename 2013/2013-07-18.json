Next, we prove that the proof\ntechnique by Shor and Preskill can be applied to quantum key distribution (QKD)\nsystems that use our generalized class of hash functions for privacy\namplification. While Shor-Preskill formalism requires an implementer of a QKD\nsystem to explicitly construct a linear code of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane\ntype, this result removes the existing difficulty of the construction a linear\ncode of CSS code by replacing it by the combination of an ordinary classical\nerror correcting code and our proposed hash function. We also show that a\nsimilar result applies to the quantum wire-tap channel. Finally we compare our\nresults in the two formalisms and show that, in typical QKD scenarios, the\nShor-Preskill--type argument gives better security bounds in terms of the trace\ndistance and Holevo information, than the method based on the \\delta-biased\nfamily.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures; revised argument concerning the relation with\n  the \\delta-biased family"]}]

It\nis thus assumed that different source specific results ((S1/D)di, (S2/D)di)\nwould represent their sources (S1, S2), and be accurately intercomparable.\nHowever, the assumption has never been checked. In this manuscript we carry out\nthis task by considering a system as CO2+-IRMS. We present a model for a priori\npredicting output-uncertainty. Our study shows that scale-conversion, even with\nthe aid of auxiliary-reference-standard(s) Ai(s), cannot make (S/D)di free from\nW; and the ((S/W)di,(A1/W)di,(A2/W)di) To (S/D)di conversion-formula normally\nused in the literature is invalid.

That is,\ncontrary to the general belief (Nature 1978, 271, 534), the scale-conversion by\nemploying one than two Ai-standards should ensure (S/D)di to be more accurate.\nHowever, a more valuable finding is that the transformation of any d-estimate\ninto its absolute value helps improve accuracy, or any reverse-process enhances\nuncertainty. Thus, equally accurate though the absolute-estimates of\nisotopic-CO2 and constituent-elemental-isotopic abundance-ratios could be, in\ncontradistinction any differential-estimate is shown to be less accurate.\nFurther, for S and D to be similar, any absolute estimate is shown to turn out\nnearly absolute accurate but any (S/D)d value as really absurd. That is,\nestimated source specific absolute values, rather than corresponding\ndifferential results, should really represent their sources, and/ or be closely\nintercomparable.\n","Comment: Revision is made with Pictorial illustrations, and/ or with New and\n  General findings: 42 pages (including a clarifying APPENDIX on notations and\n  6 Tables and 3 Figures)"]}]

However,\nDRMG suffers from inherent accuracy restrictions when multiple states are\ninvolved due to multi-state targeting and also the approximate representation\nof the Hamiltonian and other operators. By formulating the variational approach\nof DMRG explicitly for MPSs one can avoid errors inherent in the multi-state\ntargeting approach. Furthermore, by using the Matrix Product Operator (MPO)\nformalism, one can exactly represent the Hamiltonian and other operators. The\nMPO approach allows 1D Hamiltonians to be templated using a small set of finite\nstate automaton rules without reference to the particular microscopic degrees\nof freedom. We present two algorithms which take advantage of these properties:\neMPS to find excited states of 1D Hamiltonians and tMPS for the time evolution\nof a generic time-dependent 1D Hamiltonian. We properly account for\ntime-ordering of the propagator such that the error does not depend on the rate\nof change of the Hamiltonian.

This structure has been verified at tree level in various ways, but\nsimilar progress has been lacking at loop level, where the power of the duality\nwould be most significant. Here we explore colour-kinematics duality at one\nloop using the self-dual sector as a starting point. The duality is shown to\nexist in pure Yang-Mills theory for two infinite classes of amplitudes:\namplitudes with any number of particles either all of the same helicity or with\none particle helicity opposite the rest. We provide a simple Lagrangian-based\nargument in favour of the double copy relation between gauge theory and gravity\namplitudes in these classes, and provide some explicit examples. We further\ndiscuss aspects of the duality which persist after integration, leading to\nrelations among partial amplitudes. Finally, we describe form factors in the\nself-dual theory at tree level which also satisfy the duality.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 5 figures; v2: published version"]}]

From the perspective of each individual,\nhowever, it is advantageous not to volunteer such contributions, in the hope\nthat other individuals will carry the associated costs. This conflict can be\nmodeled as a volunteer's dilemma. To encourage rational individuals to make\nvoluntary contributions, a government or other social organizations can offer\nrewards, to be shared among the volunteers. Here we apply such shared rewarding\nto the generalized volunteer's dilemma, in which a threshold number of\nvolunteers is required for producing the public good. By means of theoretical\nand numerical analyses, we show that without shared rewarding only two\nevolutionary outcomes are possible: full defection or coexistence of volunteers\nand non-volunteers. We show that already small rewards destabilize full\ndefection, stabilizing small fractions of volunteers instead. Furthermore, at\nthese intermediate reward levels, we find a hysteresis effect such that\nincreasing or decreasing group sizes can trigger different social outcomes. In\nparticular, when group size is increased, the fraction of volunteers first\nincreases gradually before jumping up abruptly; when group size is then\ndecreased again, the fraction of volunteers not only remains high, but even\ncontinues to increase. As the shared reward is increased beyond a critical\nlevel, the bi-stability underlying this hysteresis effect vanishes altogether,\nand only a single social outcome remains, corresponding to the stable\ncoexistence of volunteers and non-volunteers. We find that this critical level\nof shared rewarding is relatively small compared to the total cost of\ncontributing to the public good.

The challenge comes from the fuzziness of image\nobjects and the overlapping of the different regions. Detection of edges in an\nimage is a very important step towards understanding image features.

Since edges often occur at image locations\nrepresenting object boundaries, edge detection is extensively used in image\nsegmentation when images are divided into areas corresponding to different\nobjects.

In order to understand the fluid dynamics of GTRF\nand to build an archival database of turbulence statistics for various\nconfigurations, implicit large-eddy simulations of time-dependent single-phase\nturbulent flow have been performed in 3x3 and 5x5 rod bundles with a single\ngrid spacer.

The calculations have been carried out using Hydra-TH, a\nthermal-hydraulics code developed at Los Alamos for the Consortium for Advanced\nSimulation of Light water reactors, a United States Department of Energy\nInnovation Hub. Hydra-TH uses a second-order implicit incremental projection\nmethod to solve the single-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

Traditional\napproaches have offloaded entire computations to the accelerator, resulting in\nan idle CPU, or have opted for task-level parallelism requiring large data\ntransfers between the CPU and the accelerator. True work-parallelism has been\nhard as the Accelerators cannot directly communicate with other CPUs (besides\nthe host) and Accelerators.

Employing inelastic neutron\nscattering measurements we find a strong damping of the (00z) phonon mode below\na critical temperature T_t.
