As it is well known, this intriguing, fundamental\nquantum condition is at the core of a famous argument conceived by Erwin\nSchroedinger, back in 1935. The main experimental challenge to the actual\nrealization of this object resides generally on the unavoidable and\nuncontrolled interactions with the environment, i.e. the decoherence leading to\nthe cancellation of any evidence of the quantum features associated with the\nmacroscopic system. The present scheme is based on a nonlinear process, the\n\"quantum injected optical parametric amplification\", that maps by a linearized\ncloning process the quantum coherence of a single - particle state, i.e. a\nMicro - qubit, into a Macro - qubit, consisting in a large number M of photons\nin quantum superposition. Since the adopted scheme was found resilient to\ndecoherence, the MQS\\ demonstration was carried out experimentally at room\ntemperature with $M\\geq $ $10^{4}$. This result elicited an extended study on\nquantum cloning, quantum amplification and quantum decoherence. The related\ntheory is outlined in the article where several experiments are reviewed such\nas the test on the \"no-signaling theorem\" and the dynamical interaction of the\nphoton MQS with a Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition, the consideration of\nthe Micro - Macro entanglement regime is extended into the Macro - Macro\ncondition.

Even\nthe correspondence between theory and reality is at stake here, since numerous\nreal materials show SSB in their ground states (or equilibrium states at low\ntemperature), although they are finite. Thus against what is sometimes called\n`Earman's Principle', a genuine physical effect (viz. SSB) seems theoretically\nrecovered only in some idealization (namely the thermodynamic limit),\ndisappearing as soon as the the idealization is removed. We review the\nwell-known arguments that (at first sight) no finite system can exhibit SSB,\nusing the formalism of algebraic quantum theory in order to control the\nthermodynamic limit and unify the description of finite- and infinite-volume\nsystems. Using the striking mathematical analogy between the thermodynamic\nlimit and the classical limit, we show that a similar situation obtains in\nquantum mechanics (which typically forbids SSB) versus classical mechanics\n(which allows it). This discrepancy between formalism and reality is quite\nsimilar to the measurement problem, and hence we address it in the same way,\nadapting an argument of the author and Reuvers (2013) that was originally\nintended to explain the collapse of the wave-function within conventional\nquantum mechanics. Namely, exponential sensitivity to (asymmetric)\nperturbations of the (symmetric) dynamics as the system size increases causes\nsymmetry breaking already in finite but very large quantum systems. This\nprovides continuity between finite- and infinite-volume descriptions of quantum\nsystems featuring SSB and hence restores Earman's Principle (at least in this\nparticularly threatening case).\n","Comment: 32 pages.

In total, 68 high-resolution simulation\nruns using 2000 disk planetesimals were performed, which was a significant\nimprovement on previously published results. Even when the effects of the 1:2\nMMR crossing and planet migration were included in the system, Venus and Earth\nanalogs (considering both orbits and masses) successfully formed in several\nruns. In addition, we found that the orbits of planetesimals beyond a ~1.5-2 AU\nwere dynamically depleted by the strengthened sweeping secular resonances\nassociated with Jupiter's and Saturn's more eccentric orbits (relative to\npresent-day) during planet migration. However, this depletion did not prevent\nthe formation of massive Mars analogs (planets with more than 1.5 times Mars'\nmass). Although late MMR crossings (at t > 30 Myr) could remove such planets,\nMars-like small mass planets survived on overly excited orbits (high e and/or\ni), or were completely lost in these systems. We conclude that the orbital\nmigration and crossing of the mutual 1:2 MMR of Jupiter and Saturn are unlikely\nto provide suitable orbital conditions for the formation of solar system\nterrestrial planets. This suggests that to explain Mars' small mass and the\nabsence of other planets between Mars and Jupiter, the outer asteroid belt must\nhave suffered a severe depletion due to interactions with Jupiter/Saturn, or by\nan alternative mechanism (e.g., rogue super-Earths).\n","Comment: 32 pages, 11 figures, 1 table.

The main result is the evaluation of the maximum number $M_\\epsilon$\nof $\\epsilon$-distinguishable messages ($\\epsilon$ being a bound on the noise\nof the image) which can be conveyed back from the image to reconstruct the\nobject. We study the case of coherent illumination. By using the concept of\nKolmogorov's $\\epsilon$-capacity, we obtain: $M_\\epsilon ~ 2^{S\n\\log(1/\\epsilon)} \\to \\infty$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$, where S is the Shannon\nnumber. Moreover, we show that the $\\epsilon$-capacity in inverse optical\nimaging is nearly equal to the amount of information on the object which is\ncontained in the image. We thus compare the results obtained through the\nclassical information theory, which is based on the probability theory, with\nthose derived from a form of topological information theory, based on\nKolmogorov's $\\epsilon$-entropy and $\\epsilon$-capacity, which are concepts\nrelated to the evaluation of the massiveness of compact sets.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 2 figures"]}]

To develop intuition about the\nrelationship between inflationary dynamics and the evolution of cosmic\nobservables, we investigate analytic approximations of superhorizon\nperturbation evolution.
