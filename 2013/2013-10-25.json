From a well controlled and consecutive\nin-situ intercalation and high temperature de-intercalation approach the\nresponse of each stage up to stage VI is identified. The positions of the G and\n2D lines as a function of staging depend on the charge transfer from K to the\ngraphite layers and on the lattice expansion. Ab-initio calculations of the\ndensity and the electronic band-structure demonstrate that most (but not all)\nof the transferred charge remains on the graphene sheets adjacent to the\nintercalant layers. This leads to an electronic decoupling of these \"outer\"\nlayers from the ones sandwiched between carbon layers and consequently to a\ndecoupling of the corresponding Raman spectra. Thus higher stage GICs offer the\npossibility to measure the vibrations of single, double, and multi-layer\ngraphene under conditions of biaxial strain. This strain can additionally be\ncorrelated to the in-plane lattice constants of GICs determined by x-ray\ndiffraction. The outcome of this study demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy is\na very powerful tool to identify local internal strain in pristine and weakly\ncharged single and few-layer graphene and their composites, yielding even\nabsolute lattice constants.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures, and 1 table"]}]

In this paper, we\ncall attention to a particular evolutionary aspect that in all probability is\nthe main cause of this conundrum. As soon as stellar populations intercept the\nages at which RGB stars first appear, a sudden change in the lifetime of the\ncore He-burning phase causes a temporary boost in the production rate of\nsubsequent evolutionary phases, including the TP-AGB. For a timespan of about\n0.1 Gyr, triple TP-AGB branches develop at slightly different initial masses,\ncausing their frequency and contribution to the integrated luminosity of the\nstellar population to increase by a factor of 2. The boost occurs just in the\nproximity of the expected peak in the TP-AGB lifetimes, and for ages of 1.6\nGyr. Coincidently, this relatively narrow age interval happens to contain the\nfew very massive MC clusters that host most of the TP-AGB stars used to\nconstrain stellar evolution and EPS models. This concomitance makes the\nAGB-boosting particularly insidious in the context of present EPS models. The\neffect brings about three main consequences. (1) Present estimates of the\nTP-AGB contribution to the integrated light of galaxies derived from MC\nclusters, are biased towards too large values. (2) The relative TP-AGB\ncontribution of single-burst populations falling in this critical age range\ncannot be accurately derived by the fuel consumption theorem.

Our\nresults show that the temperature response of the T1u mode is clearly different\nfrom that of the T2g mode for all three pyrochlores. In this regard, two\nfeatures are of particular note for both K and Rb; (1) the T1u mode exhibits a\ndistinctly stronger softening response with decreasing temperature compared to\nthe T2g mode, and (2) the T1u mode becomes stronger and sharper with decreasing\ntemperature. These two findings suggest that the T1u mode is significantly more\nanharmonic and sensitive to the cage dynamics than the T2g mode. Examination of\nthe local potentials around the alkali-metal atoms reveals that K has the\nflattest and most anharmonic potential at all temperatures while Cs exhibits\nthe narrowest potential. The temperature dependence of the local potentials\nreveals that, for K, the potential at a higher temperature is not a simple\nextrapolation to higher energy of that at a lower temperature. Instead, we find\nsignificant reconstruction of the potential at different temperatures. Finally,\nwe explore the temperature response of the coupling between the alkali metals\nand find a complex temperature dependence which suggests that the origin of the\ncoupling may be more complex than a pure Coulomb interaction. We also find an\nunexpected increase in the static disorder of the system at low temperatures\nfor the K and Rb pyrochlores.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 15 figures"]}]

Its proponents claim that\nits several benefits include reduced cost, increased speed and greater\nproductivity in software development. Empirical evaluations, however, are in\nthe nascent stage of examining both the benefits and the risks of cloud-based\ninfrastructure. The objective of this paper is to identify potential benefits\nand risks of using cloud in a DSD project conducted by teams based in Helsinki\nand Madrid. A cross-case qualitative analysis is performed based on focus\ngroups conducted at the Helsinki and Madrid sites. Participants' observations\nare used to supplement the analysis. The results of the analysis indicated that\nthe main benefits of using cloud are rapid development, continuous integration,\ncost savings, code sharing, and faster ramp-up. The key risks determined by the\nproject are dependencies, unavailability of access to the cloud, code\ncommitment and integration, technical debt, and additional support costs. The\nresults revealed that if such environments are not planned and set up\ncarefully, the benefits of using cloud in DSD projects might be overshadowed by\nthe risks associated with it.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 2 figures.
