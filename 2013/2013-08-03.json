Then, we make use of the advantage of the\n$(\\varepsilon,\\lambda)$--topology and grasp the local property of $L^0$--convex\nconditional risk measures to prove that every $L^{0}$--convex\n$L^{p}$--conditional risk measure ($1\\leq p\\leq+\\infty$) can be uniquely\nextended to an $L^{0}$--convex $L^{p}_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathcal{E})$--conditional\nrisk measure and that the dual representation theorem of the former can also be\nregarded as a special case of that of the latter, which shows that the study of\n$L^p$--conditional risk measures can be incorporated into that of\n$L^{p}_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathcal{E})$--conditional risk measures. In particular,\nin the process we find that combining the countable concatenation hull of a set\nand the local property of conditional risk measures is a very useful analytic\nskill that may considerably simplify and improve the study of $L^{0}$--convex\nconditional risk measures.\n","Comment: 69 pages"]}]

Prior work of\nBallard-Demmel-Holtz-Schwartz relied on a geometric inequality of Loomis and\nWhitney for this purpose. In this paper the general theory of discrete\nmultilinear Holder-Brascamp-Lieb (HBL) inequalities is used to establish\ncommunication lower bounds for a much wider class of algorithms. In some cases,\nalgorithms are presented which attain these lower bounds.\n  Several contributions are made to the theory of HBL inequalities proper. The\noptimal constant in such an inequality for torsion-free Abelian groups is shown\nto equal one whenever it is finite. Bennett-Carbery-Christ-Tao had\ncharacterized the tuples of exponents for which such an inequality is valid as\nthe convex polyhedron defined by a certain finite list of inequalities. The\nproblem of constructing an algorithm to decide whether a given inequality is on\nthis list, is shown to be equivalent to Hilbert's Tenth Problem over the\nrationals, which remains open. Nonetheless, an algorithm which computes the\npolyhedron itself is constructed.\n"]}]
