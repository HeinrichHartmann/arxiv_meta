Potential source-destination paths are dynamically\nselected from a pool of randomly located relays, from which a closed-form lower\nbound on the outage probability is derived in terms of the expected number of\npotential paths. This is in turn used to provide an upper bound on the number\nof successful transmissions that can occur per unit area, which is known as the\ntransmission capacity. The upper bound results from assuming independence among\nthe potential paths, and can be viewed as the maximum diversity case. A useful\naspect of the upper bound is its simple form for an arbitrary-sized network,\nwhich allows insights into how the number of hops and other network parameters\naffect spatial throughput in the non-asymptotic regime. The outage probability\nanalysis is then extended to account for retransmissions with a maximum number\nof allowed attempts. In contrast to prevailing wisdom, we show that\npredetermined routing (such as nearest-neighbor) is suboptimal, since more hops\nare not useful once the network is interference-limited.

In this thesis the\nentanglement of symmetric multipartite states is categorised, with a particular\nfocus on the pure multi-qubit case and the geometric measure of entanglement.\nAn essential tool for this analysis is the Majorana representation, a\ngeneralisation of the single-qubit Bloch sphere representation, which allows\nfor a unique representation of symmetric n qubit states by n points on the\nsurface of a sphere. Here this representation is employed to search for the\nmaximally entangled symmetric states of up to 12 qubits in terms of the\ngeometric measure, and an intuitive visual understanding of the upper bound on\nthe maximal symmetric entanglement is given. Furthermore, it will be seen that\nthe Majorana representation facilitates the characterisation of entanglement\nequivalence classes such as Stochastic Local Operations and Classical\nCommunication (SLOCC) and the Degeneracy Configuration (DC). It is found that\nSLOCC operations between symmetric states can be described by the Mobius\ntransformations of complex analysis, which allows for a clear visualisation of\nthe SLOCC freedoms and facilitates the understanding of SLOCC invariants and\nequivalence classes. In particular, explicit forms of representative states for\nall symmetric SLOCC classes of up to 5 qubits are derived. Well-known\nentanglement classification schemes such as the 4 qubit entanglement families\nor polynomial invariants are reviewed in the light of the results gathered\nhere, which leads to sometimes surprising connections. Some interesting links\nand applications of the Majorana representation to related fields of\nmathematics and physics are also discussed.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, University of Leeds, July 2011. 170 pages"]}]

Evolving from the $n=0$ Landau\nlevel, the central band of the Hofstadter butterfly is especially interesting\nsince it may hold a key to the mysteries of the fractional quantum Hall effect\nobserved in graphene. While the entire Hofstadter butterfly can be in principle\nobtained by solving Harper's equations numerically, the weak-field limit, most\nrelevant for experiment, is intractable due to the fact that the size of the\nHamiltonian matrix, that needs to be diagonalized, diverges. In this paper, we\ndevelop an effective Hamiltonian method that can be used to provide an accurate\nanalytic description of the central Hofstadter band in the weak-field regime.\nOne of the most important discoveries obtained in this work is that massless\nDirac particles always exist inside the central Hofstadter band no matter how\nsmall the magnetic flux may become. In other words, with its bandwidth\nbroadened by the lattice effect, the $n=0$ Landau level contains massless Dirac\nparticles within itself. In fact, by carefully analyzing the self-similar\nrecursive pattern of the central Hofstadter band, we conclude that massless\nDirac particles should occur under arbitrary magnetic field. As a corollary,\nthe central Hofstadter band also contains a self-similar structure of recursive\nLandau levels associated with such massless Dirac particles. To assess the\nexperimental feasibility of observing massless Dirac particles inside the\ncentral Hofstadter band, we compute the width of the central Hofstadter band as\na function of magnetic field in the weak-field regime.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures"]}]

In this paper, new\nresults are derived for this channel. As a first result, a noisy interference\nregime is given for the general IC where the sum-rate capacity is achieved by\ntreating interference as noise at the receivers. To obtain this result, a\nsingle-letter outer bound in terms of some auxiliary random variables is first\nestablished for the sum-rate capacity of the general IC and then those\nconditions under which this outer bound is reduced to the achievable sum-rate\ngiven by the simple treating interference as noise strategy are specified. The\nmain benefit of this approach is that it is applicable for any two-user IC\n(potentially non-Gaussian). For the special case of Gaussian channel, our\nresult is reduced to the noisy interference regime that was previously\nobtained. Next, some results are given on the Han-Kobayashi (HK) achievable\nrate region. The evaluation of this rate region is in general difficult. In\nthis paper, a simple characterization of the HK rate region is derived for some\nspecial cases, specifically, for a novel very weak interference regime. As a\nremarkable characteristic, it is shown that for this very weak interference\nregime, the achievable sum-rate due to the HK region is identical to the one\ngiven by the simple treating interference as noise strategy.\n","Comment: 12 pages.
