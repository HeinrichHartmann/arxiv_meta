The system consists of a (5+1)-dimensional model with a flux-stabilized\nsupersymmetric bulk coupled to non-supersymmetric matter localized on a\n(3+1)-dimensional positive-tension brane. We use recent techniques for\ncalculating how extra dimensions respond to changes in brane properties to show\n(at the classical level) that the low-energy 4D geometry is exactly flat,\nindependent of the value of the brane tensions.

The optical counterparts of ~95% of the AGN will be brighter\nthan I_(AB)=22.5mag.

Using the optical (u*, g', r', i') and\nNIR data (z', Ks), we develop a classifier, based on broad-band photometry, for\nidentifying stars, AGNs and galaxies improving the purity of the VIPERS sample.\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) supervised learning algorithms allow the automatic\nclassification of objects into two or more classes based on a multidimensional\nparameter space. In this work, we tailored the SVM for classifying stars, AGNs\nand galaxies, and applied this classification to the VIPERS data. We train the\nSVM using spectroscopically confirmed sources from the VIPERS and VVDS surveys.\nWe tested two SVM classifiers and concluded that including NIR data can\nsignificantly improve the efficiency of the classifier. The self-check of the\nbest optical + NIR classifier has shown a 97% accuracy in the classification of\ngalaxies, 97 for stars, and 95 for AGNs in the 5-dimensional colour space. In\nthe test on VIPERS sources with 99% redshift confidence, the classifier gives\nan accuracy equal to 94% for galaxies, 93% for stars, and 82% for AGNs. The\nmethod was applied to sources with low quality spectra to verify their\nclassification, and thus increasing the security of measurements for almost 4\n900 objects. We conclude that the SVM algorithm trained on a carefully selected\nsample of galaxies, AGNs, and stars outperforms simple colour-colour selection\nmethods, and can be regarded as a very efficient classification method\nparticularly suitable for modern large surveys.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, 9 tables, published in A&A"]}]

Such boundary conditions naturally arise from\nquantum cosmology with Hartle-Hawking wave function of the universe. The bounce\nhypersurface breaks de Sitter invariance and represents the beginning of the\nuniverse in this model. The second scenario, proposed by Carroll and Chen,\nassumes some generic initial conditions on an infinite spacelike Cauchy\nsurface. They argue that the resulting spacetime will be non-singular, apart\nfrom black holes that could be formed as the initial data is evolved, and will\nexhibit eternal inflation in both time directions. Here I show, assuming the\nnull convergence condition, that the Cauchy surface in a non-singular (apart\nfrom black holes) universe with two asymptotically inflating regions must\nnecessarily be compact. I also argue that the size of the universe at the\nbounce between the two asymptotic regions cannot much exceed the de Sitter\nhorizon. The spacetime structure is then very similar to that in the\nAguirre-Gratton scenario and does require special boundary conditions at the\nbounce. If cosmological singularities are allowed, then an infinite Cauchy\nsurface with `random' initial data will generally produce inflating regions in\nboth time directions. These regions, however, will be surrounded by\nsingularities and will have singularities in their past or future.\n","Comment: References added; some minor fine-tuning of the text"]}]

We\nfocus on the conditions necessary for the merging of the isolated eigenvalues\nwith the continuous band of the spectrum, after which the planted modular\nstructure can no longer be easily detected by spectral methods. This is a\ncrucial transition point which determines when a modular structure is strong\nenough to affect a given dynamical process. We show that this transition\nhappens in general at different points for the different matrices, and hence\nthe detectability threshold can vary significantly depending on the operator\nchosen. Equivalently, the sensitivity to the modular structure of the different\ndynamical processes associated with each matrix will be different, given the\nsame large-scale structure present in the network. Furthermore, we show that,\nwith the exception of the Laplacian matrix, the different transitions coalesce\ninto the same point for the special case where the modules are homogeneous, but\nseparate otherwise.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures + Supplemental Material; Minor text improvements,\n  updated references and publication information"]}]

We first discuss in greater\ndetail the two distinct types of quasinormal mode frequencies presented in a\nrecent paper (arXiv:1212.3271). One set of modes, that we call \"zero-damping\nmodes\", has vanishing imaginary part in the extremal limit, and exists for all\ncorotating perturbations (i.e., modes with azimuthal index m being\nnonnegative). The other set (the \"damped modes\") retains a finite decay rate\neven for extremal Kerr black holes, and exists only for a subset of corotating\nmodes. As the angular momentum approaches its extremal value, the frequency\nspectrum bifurcates into these two distinct branches when both types of modes\nare present. We discuss the physical reason for the mode branching by\ndeveloping and using a bound-state formulation for the perturbations of generic\nKerr black holes. We also numerically explore the specific case of the\nfundamental l=2 modes, which have the greatest astrophysical interest. Using\nthe results of these investigations, we compute the quasinormal mode response\nof a nearly extremal Kerr black hole to perturbations. We show that many\nsuperimposed overtones result in a slow power-law decay of the quasinormal\nringing at early times, which later gives way to exponential decay. This\nexceptional early-time power-law decay implies that the ringdown phase is\nlong-lived for black holes with large angular momentum, which could provide a\npromising strong source for gravitational-wave detectors.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 15 figures"]}]

Existing iterative convex\napproximation (ICA) methods consist in solving a series of improving convex\napproximations and are typically implemented in a per-user iterative approach.\nHowever they do not take this typical iterative implementation into account in\ntheir design.

As a result, these novel methods display a much faster\nconvergence speed and require a significantly lower computational cost.\nFurthermore, a majority of the proposed methods can tackle the issue of getting\nstuck in bad locally optimal solutions, and hence improve solution quality\ncompared to existing ICA methods.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 7 figures.

The importance of this theorem stems from the\nfact that eigenvalue problems on such matrices arise in many fields of science\nand engineering, including dynamical systems theory, economics, statistics and\noptimization. However, many real-life scenarios give rise to nonsquare\nmatrices. A natural question is whether the PF Theorem (along with its\napplications) can be generalized to a nonsquare setting. Our paper provides a\ngeneralization of the PF Theorem to nonsquare matrices. The extension can be\ninterpreted as representing client-server systems with additional degrees of\nfreedom, where each client may choose between multiple servers that can\ncooperate in serving it (while potentially interfering with other clients).\nThis formulation is motivated by applications to power control in wireless\nnetworks, economics and others, all of which extend known examples for the use\nof the original PF Theorem.\n  We show that the option of cooperation between servers does not improve the\nsituation, in the sense that in the optimal solution no cooperation is needed,\nand only one server needs to serve each client. Hence, the additional power of\nhaving several potential servers per client translates into \\emph{choosing} the\nbest single server and not into \\emph{sharing} the load between the servers in\nsome way, as one might have expected.\n  The two main contributions of the paper are (i) a generalized PF Theorem that\ncharacterizes the optimal solution for a non-convex nonsquare problem, and (ii)\nan algorithm for finding the optimal solution in polynomial time.\n"]}]

The framework\ngenerates code, along with guarantees of high level functional properties about\nthe code that can be independently verified. These high-level functional\nproperties not only serves as a certificate of good system behvaior but also\ncan be used to guarantee the absence of runtime errors. In one of our previous\nworks, we have constructed a prototype autocoder with proofs that demonstrates\nthis framework in a fully automatic fashion for linear and quasi-nonlinear\ncontrollers. With the nonlinear car example, we propose to further extend the\nprototype's dataflow annotation language environment with with several new\nannotation symbols to enable the expression of general predicates and dynamical\nsystems. We demonstrate manually how the new extensions to the prototype\nautocoder work on the car controller using the output language Matlab. Finally,\nwe discuss the requirements and scalability issues of the automatic analysis\nand verification of the documented output code.\n"]}]
