Cooperation is most difficult to explain\nin the Prisoner's Dilemma game, where cooperators always lose in direct\ncompetition with defectors despite increasing mean fitness.

We engineer an experimental Prisoner's Dilemma game\nin the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that, despite losing to\ndefectors in nonexpanding conditions, cooperators increase in frequency in\nspatially expanding populations. Fluorescently labeled colonies show genetic\ndemixing of cooperators and defectors, followed by increase in cooperator\nfrequency as cooperator sectors overtake neighboring defector sectors.

Spatial expansion thus creates a\nselective force whereby cooperator-enriched demes overtake neighboring\ndefector-enriched demes in a \"survival of the fastest\".

This material forms an\naccretion disk around the white dwarf. Ultimately, a fraction of this material\nspirals in and piles up on the white dwarf surface under electron-degenerate\nconditions. The subsequently occurring thermonuclear runaway reaches hundreds\nof megakelvin and explosively ejects matter into the interstellar medium. The\nexact peak temperature strongly depends on the underlying white dwarf mass, the\naccreted mass and metallicity, and the initial white dwarf luminosity.\nObservations of elemental abundance enrichments in these classical nova events\nimply that the ejected matter consists not only of processed solar material\nfrom the main sequence partner but also of material from the outer layers of\nthe underlying white dwarf. This indicates that white dwarf and accreted matter\nmix prior to the thermonuclear runaway. The processes by which this mixing\noccurs require further investigation to be understood. In this work, we analyze\nelemental abundances ejected from hydrodynamic nova models in search of\nelemental abundance ratios that are useful indicators of the total amount of\nmixing.

For instance, a distributed storage system storing multiple replicas of\nthe data can serve a request from any of the multiple servers that store the\nrequested data, or a computational task may be performed in a compute-cluster\nby any one of multiple processors. In such systems, the latency of serving the\nrequests may potentially be reduced by sending \"redundant requests\": a request\nmay be sent to more servers than needed, and it is deemed served when the\nrequisite number of servers complete service. Such a mechanism trades off the\npossibility of faster execution of at least one copy of the request with the\nincrease in the delay due to an increased load on the system. Due to this\ntradeoff, it is unclear when redundant requests may actually help. Several\nrecent works empirically evaluate the latency performance of redundant requests\nin diverse settings.\n  This work aims at an analytical study of the latency performance of redundant\nrequests, with the primary goals of characterizing under what scenarios sending\nredundant requests will help (and under what scenarios they will not help), as\nwell as designing optimal redundant-requesting policies. We first present a\nmodel that captures the key features of such systems. We show that when service\ntimes are i.i.d. memoryless or \"heavier\", and when the additional copies of\nalready-completed jobs can be removed instantly, redundant requests reduce the\naverage latency. On the other hand, when service times are \"lighter\" or when\nservice times are memoryless and removal of jobs is not instantaneous, then not\nhaving any redundancy in the requests is optimal under high loads.
