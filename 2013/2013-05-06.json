Gamma-ray spectra and light curves are potential unique tools\nto trace the corresponding isotopes and to give insights on the properties of\nthe expanding envelope. Another possible origin of gamma-rays is the\nacceleration of particles up to very high energies, so that either neutral\npions or inverse Compton processes produce gamma-rays of energies larger than\n100 MeV. MeV photons during nova explosions have not been detected yet,\nalthough several attempts have been made in the last decades; on the other\nhand, GeV photons from novae have been detected with the Fermi satellite in\nV407 Cyg, a nova in a symbiotic binary, where the companion is a red giant with\na wind, instead of a main sequence star as in the cataclysmic variables hosting\nclassical novae. Two more novae have been detected recently (summer 2012) by\nFermi, apparently in non symbiotic binaries, thus challenging our understanding\nof the emission mechanism. Both scenarios (radioactivities and acceleration) of\ngamma-ray production in novae are discussed.\n","Comment: 8 pages, to appear in Stella Novae: Future and Past Decades, P. A.\n  Woudt and V. A.

However, the LHC experiments have\nfound no scalar-quarks or gluinos in such mass range, and moreover, the Higgs\nboson mass of 126 GeV requires, within the MSSM framework, the scalar-top mass\nof order 1-10 TeV. This current status forces us to abandon the simplest\nsupersymmetry-breaking frameworks of the CMSSM and the GMSB scenarios.\n  The V-MSSM is investigated in this dissertation, which is proposed as an\nextension of the MSSM with a (10 + 10bar) pair of the SU(5) decuplets. In the\nframework the Higgs mass is increased by effect from the extra matters, and\nthus the 126 GeV is achieved with the scalar-top having a lighter mass.

As the extra quarks are expected to be\napproximately less than 1.2 TeV, searches for the particles are of great\ninterest at the 14 TeV LHC; constraints from the supersymmetry search,\nespecially on the gluino mass, are expected to be much improved there.\nTherefore, it is expected that the fate of the V-GMSB is adjudicated at the\ncourt of the 14 TeV LHC.\n","Comment: Dissertation submitted to Department of Physics, University of Tokyo\n  (Dec. 2012).
