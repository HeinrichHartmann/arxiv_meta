This representation\nis obtained through a quantized representation of the Hecke operators. in this\nrepresentation, the Hecke operators act on the Berezin's quantization,\ndeformation algebra of the fundamental domain of $\\PSL(2,\\Z)$ in the upper\nhalfplane. The Hecke operators are inheriting from the ambient, non-commutative\nalgebra on which they act, a rich structure of matrix inequalities. Using this\nconstruction we obtain that, for every prime $p$, the essential spectrum of the\nclassical Hecke operator $T_p$ is contained in the interval $[-2\\sqrt p, 2\\sqrt\np]$, predicted by the Ramanujan Petersson conjectures. In particular, given an\nopen interval containing $[-2\\sqrt p, 2\\sqrt p]$, there are at most a finite\nnumber of possible exceptional eigenvalues lying outside this interval. The\nmain tool for obtaining this representation of the Hecke operators (unitarely\nequivalent to the classical representation, up to commuting phase) is a Schurr\ntype, positive \"square root\" of the state on $\\PGL(2,\\Q)$, measuring the\ndisplacement of fundamental domain by translations in $\\PGL(2,\\Q)$. The \"square\nroot\" is obtained from the matrix coefficients of the discrete series\nrepresentations of $\\PSL(2,\\R)$ restricted to $\\PGL(2, \\Q)$. The methods in\nthis paper may also be applied to any finite index, modular subgroup\n$\\Gamma_0(p^n)$, $n\\geq 1$, of $\\PSL(2,\\Z)$.

The radio and x-ray data for TDE Swift J1644+57 provide a conflicting\npicture regarding the energy in relativistic jet produced in this event: x-ray\ndata suggest jet energy declining with time as t^{-5/3} whereas the nearly flat\nlightcurves in radio and mm bands lasting for about 100 days have been\ninterpreted as evidence for the total energy output increasing with time. We\nshow in this work that flat lightcurves do not require addition of energy to\ndecelerating external shock (which produced radio and mm emission via\nsynchrotron process), instead the flat behavior is due to inverse-Compton\ncooling of electrons by x-ray photons streaming through the external shock; the\nhigher x-ray flux at earlier times cools electrons more rapidly thereby\nreducing the emergent synchrotron flux, and this effect weakens as the x-ray\nflux declines with time.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, expanded discussion on Sec. 4, MNRAS accepted"]}]

The\nproposed goal-oriented POD-Greedy sampling procedure can now be implemented and\nwill look for the parameter points such that it minimizes this (asymptotic)\noutput error rather than the solution error (or, error indicator which is the\ndual norm of residual) as in the standard POD-Greedy procedure.

By\n\"throughput optimality\" it is meant that if there exists a policy that fulfils\na set of clients with a given vector of delivery ratios and a vector of channel\nreliabilities, then the MDF policy will also fulfill them. The debt of a user\nis the difference between the number of packets that should have been delivered\nso as to meet the delivery ratio and the number of packets that have been\ndelivered for that client. The maximum debt first (MDF) prioritizes the clients\nin decreasing order of debts at the beginning of every period.

We set up a low pressure torsion balance and studied\nphotophoretic forces. We investigated the dependence on plate dimensions and on\nambient pressure and considered the influence of channels through the plates.\nAs samples for full (no channel) plates we used tissue with 2mm thickness and\ncircular shape with diameters of 10mm, 30mm and 50mm. The influence of channels\nwas probed on rectangular-shaped circuit boards of 35mm x 35mm area and 1.5mm\nthickness. The number of channels was 169 and 352. At low pressure, the\nabsolute photophoretic force is proportional to the cross section of the\nplates. At high pressure, gas flow through the channels enhances the\nphotophoretic force. The pressure dependence of the radiative force can\n(formally) be calculated by photophoresis on particles with a characteristic\nlength. We derived two characteristic length scales l depending on the plate\nradius r_1, the channel radius r_2, and the thickness of the plate which equals\nthe length of the channel d as l=r^{0.35} x d^{0.65}. The highest force is\nfound at a pressure p_max = 15 x l^{-1}Pa mm. In total, the photophoretic force\non a plate with channels can be well described by a superposition of the two\ncomponents: photophoresis due to the overall size and cross section of the\nplate and photophoresis due to the channels, both with their characteristic\npressure dependencies. We applied these results to the transport of large\nsolids in protoplanetary disks and found that the influence of porosity on the\nphotophoretic force can reverse the inward drift of large solids, for instance\nmeter-sized bodies, and push them outward within the optically thin parts of\nthe disk.\n","Comment: Accepted by A&A"]}]
