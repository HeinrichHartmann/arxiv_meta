The weak EUV pulse pumps the\nhelium gas from the ground state to the 2s2p(1P) autoionizing state, which is\ncoupled to the 2s2(1S) autoionizing state by a femtosecond infrared laser with\nthe intensity in the order of 10^{12} W/cm2. The simulation shows how the\ntransient absorption and emission of the EUV are modified by the coupling\nlaser. A simple analytical expression for the atomic response derived for\ndelta-function pulses reveals the strong modification of the Fano lineshape in\nthe spectra, where these features are quite universal and remain valid for\nrealistic pulse conditions. We further account for the propagation of pulses in\nthe medium and show that the EUV signal at the atomic resonance can be enhanced\nin the gaseous medium by more than 50% for specifically adjusted laser\nparameters, and that this enhancement persists as the EUV propagates in the\ngaseous medium.

Composites were found to have better\nthermal stability than that of pure PMMA. The composite, with 38 Vol % of CCTO\n(in PMMA), exhibited remarkably low dielectric loss at high frequencies and the\nlow frequency relaxation is attributed to the space charge polarization MWS\neffect. Theoretical models were employed to rationalise the dielectric\nbehaviour of these composites. At higher temperatures, the relaxation peak\nshifts to higher frequencies, due to the merging of both {beta} and {alpha}\nrelaxations into a single dielectric dispersion peak.
