Consider the space ${\\mathcal S}_{1,w_0}({\\bar{\\mathbb\nD}},W,M)$ of continuous mappings $f$ of $\\mathbb T$ into $W$ such that\n$f(1)=w_0$ and $\\Pi\\circ f$ extends to a holomorphic on $\\mathbb D$ mapping\n$\\hat f$. Mappings $f_0,f_1\\in{\\mathcal S}_{1,w_0}({\\bar{\\mathbb D}},W,M)$ are\ncalled {\\it $h$-homotopic} if there is a continuous mapping $f_t$ of $[0,1]$\ninto $\\rS_{1,w_0}({\\bar{\\mathbb D}},W,M)$. Clearly, the $h$-homotopy is an\nequivalence relation and the equivalence class of $f\\in{\\mathcal\nS}_{1,w_0}({\\bar{\\mathbb D}},W,M)$ will be denoted by $[f]$ and the set of all\nequivalence classes by $\\eta_1(W,M,w_0)$. There is a natural mapping\n$\\iota_1:\\,\\eta_1(W,M,w_0)\\to\\pi_1(W,w_0)$ generated by assigning to\n$f\\in{\\mathcal S}_{1,w_0}({\\bar{\\mathbb D}},W,M)$ its restriction to $\\mathbb\nT$. We introduce on $\\eta_1(W,M,w_0)$ a binary operation $\\star$ which induces\non $\\eta_1(W,M,w_0)$ a structure of a semigroup with unity. Moreover,\n$\\iota_1([f_1]\\star[f_2])=\\iota_1([f_1])\\cdot\\iota_1([f_2])$, where $\\cdot$ is\nthe standard operation on $\\pi_1(W,w_0)$.

However, most\nexisting work deals with networks that simply encode whether relationships\nexist or not. In contrast, relationships in signed networks can be positive\n(\"like\", \"trust\") or negative (\"dislike\", \"distrust\"). The theory of social\nbalance shows that signed networks tend to conform to some local patterns that,\nin turn, induce certain global characteristics. In this paper, we exploit both\nlocal as well as global aspects of social balance theory for two fundamental\nproblems in the analysis of signed networks: sign prediction and clustering.\nMotivated by local patterns of social balance, we first propose two families of\nsign prediction methods: measures of social imbalance (MOIs), and supervised\nlearning using high order cycles (HOCs). These methods predict signs of edges\nbased on triangles and \\ell-cycles for relatively small values of \\ell.\nInterestingly, by examining measures of social imbalance, we show that the\nclassic Katz measure, which is used widely in unsigned link prediction,\nactually has a balance theoretic interpretation when applied to signed\nnetworks. Furthermore, motivated by the global structure of balanced networks,\nwe propose an effective low rank modeling approach for both sign prediction and\nclustering. For the low rank modeling approach, we provide theoretical\nperformance guarantees via convex relaxations, scale it up to large problem\nsizes using a matrix factorization based algorithm, and provide extensive\nexperimental validation including comparisons with local approaches. Our\nexperimental results indicate that, by adopting a more global viewpoint of\nbalance structure, we get significant performance and computational gains in\nprediction and clustering tasks on signed networks. Our work therefore\nhighlights the usefulness of the global aspect of balance theory for the\nanalysis of signed networks.\n"]}]

In this paper, we give an unconditional secure\nauthentication scheme for network coding based on a linear code $C$.\nSafavi-Naini and Wang gave an authentication code for multi-receivers and\nmultiple messages.

One advantage of this generalization is that for a fixed message space,\nour scheme allows arbitrarily many receivers to check the integrity of their\nown messages, while the scheme with Reed-Solomon codes has a constraint on the\nnumber of verifying receivers. Another advantage is that we introduce access\nstructure in the generalized scheme.

The question which individuals should be\nimmunized in order to mitigate the impact of the virus on the rest of\npopulation has received quite some attention in the literature. The dynamics of\nthe of a virus spread through a population is often represented as information\nspread over a complex network. The strategies commonly proposed to determine\nwhich nodes are to be selected for immunization often involve only one\ncentrality measure at a time, while often the topology of the network seems to\nsuggest that a single metric is insufficient to capture the influence of a node\nentirely.\n  In this work we present a generic method based on a genetic algorithm (GA)\nwhich does not rely explicitly on any centrality measures during its search but\nonly exploits this type of information to narrow the search space. The fitness\nof an individual is defined as the estimated expected number of infections of a\nvirus following SIR dynamics. The proposed method is evaluated on two contact\nnetworks: the Goodreau's Faux Mesa high school and the US air transportation\nnetwork. The GA method manages to outperform the most common strategies based\non a single metric for the air transportation network and its performance is\ncomparable with the best performing strategy for the high school network.\n","Comment: To appear in the proceedings of the International Conference on\n  Computational Science (ICCS) in Barcelona. 11 pages, 5 figures"]}]
