The links from the\nsource to the users are modeled as independent erasure channels. Users are\nallowed to inform the source node whether a packet is received correctly via\nfeedback channels. In order to minimize the number of packet transmissions\nuntil all users have received all packets successfully, it is necessary that a\ndata packet, if successfully received by a user, can increase the dimension of\nthe vector space spanned by the encoding vectors he or she has received by one.\nSuch an encoding vector is called innovative. We prove that innovative linear\nnetwork code is uniformly optimal in minimizing user download delay. When the\nfinite field size is strictly smaller than the number of users, the problem of\ndetermining the existence of innovative vectors is proven to be NP-complete.\nWhen the field size is larger than or equal to the number of users, innovative\nvectors always exist and random linear network code (RLNC) is able to find an\ninnovative vector with high probability. While RLNC is optimal in terms of\ncompletion time, it has high decoding complexity due to the need of solving a\nsystem of linear equations. To reduce decoding time, we propose the use of\nsparse linear network code, since the sparsity property of encoding vectors can\nbe exploited when solving systems of linear equations. Generating a sparsest\nencoding vector with large finite field size, however, is shown to be NP-hard.\nAn approximation algorithm that guarantee the Hamming weight of a generated\nencoding vector to be smaller than a certain factor of the optimal value is\nconstructed.

The new data offer a fourfold increase in\nrecorded luminosity, providing higher precision and a larger reach in\ntransverse momentum, p_T, to 20 GeV/c. The production ratio of eta/pi^0 is\n0.46+/-0.01(stat)+/-0.05(syst), constant with p_T and collision centrality. The\nobserved ratio is consistent with earlier measurements, as well as with the p+p\nand d+Au values. The production of pi^0 is suppressed by a factor of 5, as in\nearlier findings. However, with the improved statistical precision a small but\nsignificant rise of the nuclear modification factor, R_AA, vs p_T, with a slope\nof 0.0106+/-^(0.0034)_(0.0029)[GeV/c]^-1, is discernible in central collisions.\nA phenomenological extraction of the average fractional parton energy loss\nshows a decrease with increasing p_T. To study the path length dependence of\nsuppression, the pi^0 yield was measured at different angles with respect to\nthe event plane; a strong azimuthal dependence of the pi^0 R_AA is observed.\nThe data are compared to theoretical models of parton energy loss as a function\nof the path length, L, in the medium. Models based on pQCD are insufficient to\ndescribe the data, while a hybrid model utilizing pQCD for the hard\ninteractions and AdS/CFT for the soft interactions is consistent with the data.\n","Comment: 383 authors, 70 institutions, 21 pages, 22 figures, 8 tables.\n  Submitted to Phys.

The observed asymmetry for forward neutron\nproduction is discussed within the pion exchange framework, with interference\nbetween the spin-flip amplitude due to the pion exchange and nonflip amplitudes\nfrom all Reggeon exchanges.

A spatial search can be effected by the continuous-time evolution of a\nsingle quantum particle on a graph containing a marked site. In many physical\nimplementations, however, one might expect to have multiple particles. In\ninteracting bosonic systems at zero temperature, the dynamics is well-described\nby a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We investigate the role of\nnonlinearity in determining the efficiency of the spatial search algorithm\nwithin the quantum walk model, for the complete graph. The analytical\ncalculations reveal that the nonlinear search time scales with size of the\nsearch space N like the square root of N, equivalent to the linear case though\nwith a different overall constant. The results indicate that interacting\nBose-Einstein condensates at zero temperature could be natural systems for the\nimplementation of the quantum search algorithm.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures; introduction and background sections overhauled;\n  new section added addressing the impact of errors"]}]

While the short-distance behavior of\nthis factor is well understood, little is known about the form of f(rij) at\nlarge rij. In this work we investigate the optimal form of f(r12) on the\nexample of the helium atom and helium-like ions and several well-motivated\nmodels of the wave function. Using the Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle we\nderive a differential equation for f(r12) and solve it using numerical\npropagation or analytic asymptotic expansion techniques. We found that for\nevery model under consideration, f(r12) behaves at large r12 as r12^{\\rho}\nexp(B r12) and obtained simple analytic expressions for the system dependent\nvalues of {\\rho} and B. For the ground state of the helium-like ions the value\nof B is positive, so that f(r12) diverges as r12 tends to infinity. The\nnumerical propagation confirms this result. When the Hartree-Fock orbitals,\nmultiplied by the correlation factor, are expanded in terms of Slater functions\nr^n exp(-{\\beta}r), the numerical propagation reveals a minimum in f(r12) with\ndepth increasing with N.

Since its\nproposition in 1988, this formalism has been applied to investigate a wide\nvariety of natural phenomena. In stellar astrophysics, theoretical distribution\nfunction based on nonextensive formalism (q-distributions) has been\nsuccessfully applied to reproduce the distribution of stellar radial and\nrotational velocity data. In this paper, we investigate the time variation of\nthe entropic index q obtained from the distribution of rotation, Vsini, for a\nsample of 254 rotational data for solar-type stars from 11 open clusters aged\nbetween 35.5Myr and 2.6Gyr. As a result, we have found an anti-correlation\nbetween the entropic index q and the age of clusters, and that the distribution\nof rotation Vsini for these stars becomes extensive for an age greater than\nabout 170Myr. Assuming that the parameter q is associated with long-memory\neffects, we suggest that the memory of the initial angular momentum of\nsolar-type stars can be scaled by the entropic index q.

By including a subadiabatic layer at the bottom of the\ndomain, corresponding to the stratification of a radiative zone, we reproduce a\nlayer of strong radial shear similar to the solar tachocline. Similarly,\nenhanced superadiabaticity at the top results in a near-surface shear layer\nlocated mainly at lower latitudes. The models reveal a latitudinal entropy\ngradient localized at the base of the convection zone and in the stable region,\nwhich however does not propagate across the convection zone. In consequence,\nbaroclinicity effects remain small and the rotation iso-contours align in\ncylinders along the rotation axis. Our results confirm the alignment of large\nconvective cells along the rotation axis in the deep convection zone, and\nsuggest that such \"banana-cell\" pattern can be hidden beneath the\nsupergranulation layer.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 13 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

The results concerning\nthe vector weak transition revealed a very interesting new scenario in s-wave\nphase-shift: agrees well with data in the elastic region, and it starts from\n$-60$ degrees. Up to now the reason way the experimental phase starts at\nnegative degrees($\\approx - 138$) was a mystery. However, we show that this\nbehaviour is a consequence of interference between a correct weak vertex\ndynamic, dominated by $\\rho$ meson propagator, and a rescattering model to the\nfinal state interaction. Therefore, this work represent a progress in the\nunderstanding of $D^+ \\to K^-\\pi^+\\pi+$ and could be applied to other decays.\n","Comment: to appear in the proceedings of The 6th International Workshop on\n  Charm Physics (CHARM 2013)"]}]

The\nfirst one follows the observation that the classical definition of derivatives\ninvolves prospective (or forward) difference quotients, not known whenever the\ntime is directed, at least at the macroscopic level. Actually, the available\nand known derivatives are retrospective (or backward). They co\\\"incide whenever\nthe functions are differentiable in the classical sense, but not in the case of\nnon smooth maps, single-valued or set-valued. The later ones are used in\ndifferential inclusions (and thus, in uncertain control systems) governing\nevolutions in function of time and state. We follow the plea of some physicists\nfor taking also into account the retrospective derivatives to study prospective\nevolutions in function of time, state and retrospective derivatives, a\nparticular, but specific, example of historical of ''path dependent''\nevolutionary systems. This is even more crucial in life sciences, in the\nabsence of experimentation of uncertain evolutionary systems. The second\nmotivation emerged from the study of networks with junctions (cross-roads in\ntraffic networks, synapses in neural networks, banks in financial networks,\netc.), an important feature of ''complex systems''. At each junction, the\nvelocities of the incoming (retrospective) and outgoing (prospective)\nevolutions are confronted. One measure of this confrontation (''jerkiness'') is\nprovided by the product of the retrospective and prospective velocities,\nnegative in ''inhibitory'' junctions, positive for ''excitatory'' ones, for\ninstance. This leads to the introduction of the ''differential connection\ntensor'' of two evolutions, defined as the tensor product of retrospective and\nprospective derivatives, which can be used for controlling evolutionary systems\ngoverning the evolutions through networks with junctions.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

For such an identity, $\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_m$\nsatisfy the same set of linearly independent contiguous relations.

Using Stanley's lemma on the fundamental parallelepiped, we\nfind an upper bound of the dimension of $V_C$.

Clearly\nevident in the HI data cube is the presence of an anomalous HI component that\nis both diffuse and slow-rotating. The data cube is dynamically decomposed into\nregular and anomalous HI components. A mass of M_HI=1.5 x 10^9 Msun is\nestimated for the anomalous HI - 20 per cent of the total HI mass. Standard HI\ndata products and rotation curves are produced for each dynamical component. In\nterms of circular rotation speed, the anomalous HI is found to lag the regular\nHI by ~25 - 125 km/s. Three-dimensional models are generated and used to\ndetermine the possible location of the anomalous HI. The results strongly\nsuggest it to be distributed in a thick disc with a scale-height of a few kpc\n(~3.5 kpc).
