In all these situations one goal is to quantify and often\nthen to improve the degree of homogenisation of a substance being stirred,\nreferred to as a passive scalar or tracer. A classical measure of mixing is the\nvariance of the concentration of the scalar, which can be related to the $L^2$\nnorm of the concentration field. Recently other norms have been used to\nquantify mixing, in particular the mix-norm as well as negative Sobolev norms.\nThese norms have the advantage that unlike variance they decay even in the\nabsence of diffusion, and their decay corresponds to the flow being mixing in\nthe sense of ergodic theory. General Sobolev norms weigh scalar gradients\ndifferently, and are known as multiscale norms for mixing. We review the\napplications of such norms to mixing and transport, and show how they can be\nused to optimise the stirring and mixing of a decaying passive scalar. We then\nreview recent work on the less-studied case of a continuously-replenished\nscalar field --- the source-sink problem.

Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on level-triggered\nsampling, a non-uniform sampling strategy, and sequential estimation. The\nproposed estimator can be used as an asymptotically optimal fixed-sample-size\ndecentralized estimator under non-fading listening channels (through which\nsensors collect their observations), as an alternative to the one-shot\nestimators commonly found in the literature. It can also be used as an\nasymptotically optimal sequential decentralized estimator under fading\nlistening channels. We show that the optimal centralized estimator under\nGaussian noise is characterized by two processes, namely the observed Fisher\ninformation U_t, and the observed correlation V_t. It is noted that under\nnon-fading listening channels only V_t is random, whereas under fading\nlistening channels both U_t and V_t are random. In the proposed scheme, each\nsensor computes its local random process(es), and sends a single bit to the\nfusion center (FC) whenever the local random process(es) pass(es) certain\npredefined levels. The FC, upon receiving a bit from a sensor, updates its\napproximation to the corresponding global random process, and accordingly its\nestimate. The sequential estimation process terminates when the observed Fisher\ninformation (or the approximation to it) reaches a target value. We provide an\nasymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator and also the one based on\nconventional uniform-in-time sampling under both non-fading and fading\nchannels; and determine the conditions under which they are asymptotically\noptimal, consistent, and asymptotically unbiased.

It has been speculated that in addition to\ndot-to-dot variation in physical dimensions, this spread is contributed to by\nvariations in the structure of the quantum dot interface, which controls the\nshape of the confinement potential. Here we directly evaluate the effect of the\ncomposition of the core-shell interface on single- and multi-exciton dynamics\nvia side-by-side measurements of individual core-shell CdSe-CdS nanocrystals\nwith a sharp vs. smooth (graded) interface. To realize the latter type of\nstructures, we incorporate a CdSexS1-x alloy layer of controlled composition\nand thickness between the CdSe core and the CdS shell.

This observation\nprovides direct experimental evidence that in addition to the size of the\nquantum dot, its interfacial properties also significantly affect the rate of\nAuger recombination, which governs biexciton decay. These findings help\nrationalize previous observations of a significant heterogeneity in the\nbiexciton lifetimes across similarly sized quantum dots and should facilitate\nthe development of Auger-recombination-free colloidal nanostructures for a\nrange of applications from lasers and light-emitting diodes to photodetectors\nand solar cells.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to insufficient\n  experimental data"]}]

This paper takes a\nsignificant step towards understanding computational aspects of markets with\nproduction.\n  We first define the notion of separable, piecewise-linear concave (SPLC)\nproduction by analogy with SPLC utility functions. We then obtain a linear\ncomplementarity problem (LCP) formulation that captures exactly the set of\nequilibria for Arrow-Debreu markets with SPLC utilities and SPLC production,\nand we give a complementary pivot algorithm for finding an equilibrium. This\nsettles a question asked by Eaves in 1975 of extending his complementary pivot\nalgorithm to markets with production.\n  Since this is a path-following algorithm, we obtain a proof of membership of\nthis problem in PPAD, using Todd, 1976. We also obtain an elementary proof of\nexistence of equilibrium (i.e., without using a fixed point theorem),\nrationality, and oddness of the number of equilibria. We further give a proof\nof PPAD-hardness for this problem and also for its restriction to markets with\nlinear utilities and SPLC production. Experiments show that our algorithm runs\nfast on randomly chosen examples, and unlike previous approaches, it does not\nsuffer from issues of numerical instability. Additionally, it is strongly\npolynomial when the number of goods or the number of agents and firms is\nconstant. This extends the result of Devanur and Kannan (2008) to markets with\nproduction.\n  Finally, we show that an LCP-based approach cannot be extended to PLC\n(non-separable) production, by constructing an example which has only\nirrational equilibria.\n","Comment: An extended abstract will appear in SODA 2014"]}]

This yields to\nk=1,2,...,[(D-1)/2] inequivalent possible gravity theories; here the case k=1\ncorresponds to the standard Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian. For each par (D,k), we\nderive two classes of AdS black hole solutions with planar event horizon\ntopology for particular values of the nonminimal coupling parameter. The first\nfamily of solutions depends on a unique constant and is valid only for k>1. In\nfact, its GR counterpart k=1 reduces to the pure AdS metric with a vanishing\nscalar field. The second family of solutions involves two independent constants\nand corresponds to a stealth black hole configuration; that is a nontrivial\nscalar field together with a black hole metric such that both side of the\nEinstein equations (gravity and matter parts) vanishes identically. In this\ncase, the standard GR case k=1 reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS-Tangherlini\nblack hole metric with a trivial scalar field. In both cases, the existence of\nthese solutions is strongly inherent of the presence of the higher order\ncurvature terms k>1 of the Lovelock gravity.

Its outstanding principal advantages comes from the\nfact that the angular structure of an astronomical object is simply determined\nfrom the visibility of the minima of the spectrum of the intensity fluctuations\nmeasured by the detector, as a function of the frequency of the fluctuations,\nwhile keeping the spacing between mirrors constant. This would allow a simple\nsetup capable of high angular resolutions because it could use an extremely\nlarge baseline. Another major interest is that it allows for a more efficient\nuse of telescope time because observations at a single baseline are sufficient,\nwhile amplitude and intensity interferometers need several observations at\ndifferent baselines. The fact that one does not have to move the telescopes\nwould also allow detecting faster time variations because having to move the\ntelescopes sets a lower limit to the time variations that can be detected. The\ntechnique uses wave interaction effects and thus has some characteristics in\ncommon with intensity interferometry. A disadvantage of the technique, like in\nintensity interferometry, is that it needs strong sources if observing at high\nfrequencies (e.g. the visible).

We consider a finite atomic\nchain which is coupled to a zero-temperature outer environment, modeled as two\nadditional semi-infinite chains, thus inducing \"clamping-losses\". Weak coupling\nto the outer environment ensures that the clamping losses are small, and that\nthe initially discrete nature of the phonon spectrum is approximately\nmaintained. We then consider a phonon damping process known as \"Landau-Rumer\ndamping\", where phonons in the excited mode of vibration decay into other modes\nthrough anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction. The approximately discrete nature\nof the phonon spectrum leads to sharp nonmonotonic changes in Q as parameters\nare varied, and to the appearance of resonances in the damping. The latter\ncorrespond to the existence of decay processes where the participating phonons\napproximately conserve energy. We explore means to control the damping by\nchanging either the number of atoms in the chains or the ratio between the\nlongitudinal and transverse speeds of sound, thereby suggesting future\nexperiments to observe this resonance-like behavior.\n"]}]

We prove a tropical generalization of\nmirror symmetry for elliptic curves, i.e., a statement relating certain labeled\nGromov-Witten invariants of a tropical elliptic curve to more refined Feynman\nintegrals. This result easily implies the tropical analogue of the mirror\nsymmetry statement mentioned above and, using the necessary Correspondence\nTheorem, also the mirror symmetry statement itself. In this way, our tropical\ngeneralization leads to an alternative proof of mirror symmetry for elliptic\ncurves. We believe that our approach via tropical mirror symmetry naturally\ncarries the potential of being generalized to more adventurous situations of\nmirror symmetry. Moreover, our tropical approach has the advantage that all\ninvolved invariants are easy to compute. Furthermore, we can use the techniques\nfor computing Feynman integrals to prove that they are quasimodular forms.\nAlso, as a side product, we can give a combinatorial characterization of\nFeynman graphs for which the corresponding integrals are zero. More generally,\nthe tropical mirror symmetry theorem gives a natural interpretation of the\nA-model side (i.e., the generating function of Gromov-Witten invariants) in\nterms of a sum over Feynman graphs. Hence our quasimodularity result becomes\nmeaningful on the A-model side as well. Our theoretical results are\ncomplemented by a Singular package including several procedures that can be\nused to compute Hurwitz numbers of the elliptic curve as integrals over Feynman\ngraphs.\n","Comment: 25 pages + Appendix, 16 figures"]}]
