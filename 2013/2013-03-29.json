Since these evanescent waves contain the finest details of the\nsource, the image suffers a loss of resolution and is referred to as\n'diffraction-limited'. Superlensing is the ability to create an image with fine\nfeatures beyond the diffraction limit, and can be achieved with a\n'Veselago-Pendry' lens made from a metamaterial. Such a Veselago-Pendry\nsuperlens for imaging in free space must be stringently designed to restore\nboth propagating and evanescent waves, but meeting these design conditions\n(isotropic n = epsilon_r = mu_r = -1) has proven difficult and has made its\nrealization elusive. We demonstrate free-space imaging with a resolution over\nthree times better than the diffraction limit at microwave frequencies using a\nVeselago-Pendry metamaterial superlens based on the negative-refractive-index\ntransmission-line (NRI-TL) approach, which affords precise control over its\nelectromagnetic properties and is also less susceptible to losses than other\napproaches. A microwave superlens can be particularly useful for illumination\nand discrimination of closely spaced buried objects over practical distances by\nway of back-scattering, e.g. in tumour or landmine detection, or for targeted\nirradiation/hyperthermia.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Antennas and\n  Propagation"]}]

EMMIX-uskew also supports visualization of fitted contours in two and\nthree dimensions, and random sample generation from a specified FM-uMST\ndistribution.\n  Finite mixtures of skew t-distributions have proven to be useful in modelling\nheterogeneous data with asymmetric and heavy tail behaviour, for example,\ndatasets from flow cytometry. In recent years, various versions of mixtures\nwith multivariate skew t (MST) distributions have been proposed. However, these\nmodels adopted some restricted characterizations of the component MST\ndistributions so that the E-step of the EM algorithm can be evaluated in closed\nform. This paper focuses on mixtures with unrestricted MST components, and\ndescribes an iterative algorithm for the computation of the ML estimates of its\nmodel parameters.\n  The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in three\napplications to real data sets.

Some highly refractory grains (Type B\ncalcium-aluminum-rich inclusions, CAIs) also show signs of transient heating. A\nsimilar process may occur in other protoplanetary disks, as evidenced by\nobservations of spectra characteristic of crystalline silicates. One possible\nenvironment for this process is the turbulent magnetohydrodynamic flow thought\nto drive accretion in these disks. Such flows generally form thin current\nsheets, which are sites of magnetic reconnection, and dissipate the magnetic\nfields amplified by a disk dynamo. We suggest that it is possible to heat\nprecursor grains for chondrules and other high-temperature minerals in current\nsheets that have been concentrated by our recently described short-circuit\ninstability. We extend our work on this process by including the effects of\nradiative cooling, taking into account the temperature dependence of the\nopacity; and by examining current sheet geometry in three-dimensional, global\nmodels of magnetorotational instability. We find that temperatures above 1600 K\ncan be reached for favorable parameters that match the ideal global models.\nThis mechanism could provide an efficient means of tapping the gravitational\npotential energy of the protoplanetary disk to heat grains strongly enough to\nform high-temperature minerals. The volume-filling nature of turbulent magnetic\nreconnection is compatible with constraints from chondrule-matrix\ncomplementarity, chondrule-chondrule complementarity, the occurrence of igneous\nrims, and compound chondrules.

We present two nonparametric methods for estimating the\nunknown joint population distribution of model parameter values in a\npharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) dataset.

Behavior based classification uses\nartifacts created by malware during execution for identification. In this paper\nwe report on a unique dataset we obtained from our operations and classified\nusing several machine learning techniques using the behavior-based approach.\nOur main class of malware we are interested in classifying is the popular Zeus\nmalware. For its classification we identify 65 features that are unique and\nrobust for identifying malware families. We show that artifacts like file\nsystem, registry, and network features can be used to identify distinct malware\nfamilies with high accuracy---in some cases as high as 95%.\n","Comment: Accepted to SIMPLEX 2013 (a workshop held in conjunction with WWW\n  2013)"]}]

Especially during thunderstorms, there are\nadditional strong electric fields in the atmosphere, which can lead to further\nmultiplication and acceleration of the charged particles and thus have\ninfluence on the form and strength of the radio emission. For a reliable energy\nreconstruction of the primary cosmic ray by means of the measured radio signal\nit is very important to understand how electric fields affect the radio\nemission. In addition, lightning strikes are a prominent source of broadband\nradio emissions that are visible over very long distances. This, on the one\nhand, causes difficulties in the detection of the much lower signal of the air\nshower. On the other hand the recorded signals can be used to study features of\nthe lightning development. The detection of cosmic rays via the radio emission\nand the influence of strong electric fields on this detection technique is\ninvestigated with the LOPES experiment in Karlsruhe, Germany. The important\nquestion if a lightning is initiated by the high electron density given at the\nmaximum of a high-energy cosmic-ray air shower is also investigated, but could\nnot be answered by LOPES.

We present a specification\nfor a cognitive architecture that is capable of specifying an unlimited range\nof behaviors. We then give examples of how it can stochastically explore an\ninteresting space of adjacent possible behaviors. There are two main novelties;\nthe first is a proper definition of the fitness of self-generated games such\nthat interesting games are expected to evolve. The second is a modular and\nevolvable behavior language that has systematicity, productivity, and\ncompositionality, i.e. it is a physical symbol system. A part of the\narchitecture has already been implemented on a humanoid robot.\n","Comment: Submitted as Part 2 to Living Machines 2013, Natural History Museum,\n  London.

Using the replica trick the EREs can be related to a\npartition function of n copies of the CFT glued together in a particular way\nalong the intervals. In the case of two intervals this procedure defines a\ngenus n-1 surface and our goal is to find smooth three dimensional\ngravitational solutions with this surface living at the boundary. We find two\nfamilies of handlebody solutions labelled by the replica index n. These\nparticular bulk solutions are distinguished by the fact that they do not\nspontaneously break the replica symmetries of the boundary surface. We show\nthat the regularized classical action of these solutions is given in terms of a\nsimple numerical prescription. If we assume that they give the dominant\ncontribution to the gravity partition function we can relate this classical\naction to the EREs at leading order in G_N. We argue that the prescription can\nbe formulated for non-integer n.

A novel quality function and a smoothness constraint are\nproposed to handle overlaps, and a new convex relaxation is used to solve the\nresulting combinatorial optimization problem. We provide theoretical guarantees\nas well as experimental results that reveal community structure in real and\nsynthetic networks. Our main insight is that certain structures can be\nidentified only when temporal correlation is considered and when communities\nare allowed to overlap.
