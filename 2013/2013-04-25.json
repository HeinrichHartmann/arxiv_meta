Nevertheless, this irreducibility, even in the basic\nquantum informational setting of composite states, is also present due to the\nintrinsic structure of Hilbert spaces' tensor product. In this approach, this\nirreducibility is quantified based on statistics of von Neumann measurements\nforming mutually unbiased bases.

Results show that this quantification is sensible to the different\nkind of entanglement present on those families.\n","Comment: 2 pages, 2 figures"]}]

We study the impact on the maximum\npossible neutron-star mass of an \"exotic\" core consisting of non-nucleonic\nmatter. For this purpose, we study the occurrence of a first-order phase\ntransition in nucleonic matter. Given the current lack of knowledge of\nnon-nucleonic matter, we consider the stiffest possible equation of state\nsubject only to the constraints of causality and thermodynamic stability. The\ncase of a hadron-quark phase transition is discussed separately. The purely\nnucleonic matter is described using a set of unified equations of state that\nhave been recently developed to permit a consistent treatment of both\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. We then compute the mass-radius relation\nof cold nonaccreting neutron stars with and without exotic cores from the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. We find that even if there is a\nsignificant softening of the equation of state associated with the actual\ntransition to an exotic phase, there can still be a stiffening at higher\ndensities closer to the center of the star that is sufficient to increase the\nmaximum possible mass. However with quarks the maximum neutron-star mass is\nalways reduced by assuming that the sound speed is limited by $c/\\sqrt{3}$ as\nsuggested by QCD calculations. In particular, by invoking such a phase\ntransition, it becomes possible to support PSR J1614$-$2230 with a nucleonic\nequation of state that is soft enough to be compatible with the kaon and pion\nproduction in heavy-ion collisions.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In the\npositive cosmological constant case, it is shown that unlike the commutative as\nwell as GUP cases, in DSR-GUP case both scale factors of internal and external\nspaces after accelerating phase will inevitably experience decelerating phase\nleading simultaneously to a big crunch. This demarcation from GUP originates\nfrom the difference between the GUP and DSR-GUP algebras. The important result\nis that unlike GUP which results in eternal acceleration, DSR-GUP at first\ngenerates acceleration but prevents the eternal acceleration at late times and\nturns it into deceleration.\n","Comment: 12 pages, minor revision, To be published in MPLA. arXiv admin note:\n  text overlap with arXiv:hep-th/0608011 by other authors"]}]
