As a unique tool to count the number of excitations\ncarried per pulse, shot noise reveals that pulses of arbitrary shape and\narbitrary charge show a marked minimum when the charge is integer. Shot noise\nspectroscopy is also considered to perform energy-domain characterization of\nthe charge pulses. In particular it reveals the striking asymmetrical spectrum\nof Lorentzian pulses. Finally, time-domain information is obtained from Hong Ou\nMandel like noise correlations when two trains of pulses generated on opposite\ncontacts collide on the scatterer. As a function of the time delay between\npulse trains, the noise is shown to measure the electron wavepacket\nautocorrelation function for integer Lorentzian thanks to electron\nantibunching.

For the purpose of examining the\nmicroscopic loss mechanisms in dielectrics, precise measurements of the\ninternal quality factor at different values of energy stored in the resonators\nare required. Here, we present a consistent method to analyze a LC\nsuperconducting resonator coupled to a transmission line. We first derive an\napproximate expression for the transmission S-parameter $S_{21}$ based on a\ncomplete circuit model. In the weak coupling limit, we show that the internal\nquality factor is reliably determined by fitting the approximate form of\n$S_{21}$. Since the voltage $V$ of the capacitor of the LC circuit is required\nto determine the energy stored in the resonator, we next calculate the relation\nbetween $V$ and the forward propagating wave voltage $V_{in}^+$. Due to the\ndependence of the quality factor on voltage, $V$ is not simply proportional to\n$V_{in}^+$. We find a self-consistent way to determine the relation between $V$\nand $V_{in}^+$, which employs only the fitting parameters for $S_{21}$ and a\nlinear scaling factor. We then examine the resonator transmission in the cases\nof port reflection and impedance mismatch. We find that resonator transmission\nasymmetry is primarily due to the reflection from discontinuity in transmission\nlines. We show that our analysis method to extract the internal quality factor\nis robust in the non-ideal cases above. Finally, we show that the analysis\nmethod on LC resonator can be generalize to arbitrary weakly coupled lumped and\ndistributed resonators.

In the inverse seesaw scenario, the smallness of neutrino masses is\nlinked to the smallness of a lepton number violating parameter. This parameter\nmay arise radiatively. In this paper, we study the cosmological implications of\ntwo contrasting radiative inverse seesaw models, one due to Ma and the other to\nLaw and McDonald. The former features spontaneous, the latter explicit lepton\nnumber violation. First, we examine the effect of the lepton-number violating\ninteractions introduced in these models on the baryon asymmetry of the\nuniverse. We investigate under what conditions a pre-existing baryon asymmetry\ndoes not get washed out. While both models allow a baryon asymmetry to survive\nonly once the temperature has dropped below the mass of their heaviest fields,\nthe Ma model can create the baryon asymmetry through resonant leptogenesis.\nThen we investigate the viability of the dark matter candidates arising within\nthese models, and explore the prospects for direct detection. We find that the\nLaw/McDonald model allows a simple dark matter scenario similar to the Higgs\nportal, while in the Ma model the simplest cold dark matter scenario would tend\nto overclose the universe.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 11 figures.

The flavor content of the signal evolves\ndue to both neutrino collective effects and matter effects which can lead to a\nhighly interesting interplay and distinctive spectral features. In this paper\nwe investigate the supernova neutrino flavor evolution in three different\nprogenitors and include collective flavor effects, the evolution of the\nMikheyev, Smirnov & Wolfenstein conversion due to the shock wave passage\nthrough the star, and the impact of turbulence. In the Oxygen-Neon-Magnesium\nsupernova we find that the impact of turbulence is both brief and slight during\na window of 1-2 seconds post bounce. Thus the spectral features of collective\nand shock effects in the neutrino signals from ONeMg supernovae may be almost\nturbulence free making them the easiest to interpret. For the more massive\nprogenitors we again find that small amplitude turbulence, up to 10%, leads to\na minimal modification of the signal, and the emerging neutrino spectra retain\nboth collective and MSW features. However, when larger amounts of turbulence is\nadded, 30% and 50%, the features of collective and shock wave effects in the\nhigh density resonance channel are almost completely obscured at late times.\nYet at the same time we find the other mixing channels - the low density\nresonance channel and the non-resonant channels - begin to develop turbulence\nsignatures.

It turns out that the contributions\nfrom the weakly-bound orbits with low orbital angular momenta $l$ play an\nimportant role. As an example, we investigate the neutron-rich Mg isotopes as a\nfunction of the pairing strength in situations, where the neuron Fermi surface\nare below, between and above two weakly-bound $2p$ levels. We find that the\nsize of the pairing correlations has a two-fold influence on the density\ndistribution of the neutrons and therefore on the total nuclear size. First it\ncan change the root mean square (rms) radius of the individual weakly-bound\norbits and second it can enhance the occupation probabilities of these orbits\nin the nuclear system. On one side increasing pairing correlations reduce the\nrms radii of the orbits with small orbital angular momenta close to the\ncontinuum limit (pairing anti-halo effect), on the other side they also can\nlead to an enhanced occupation of low-$l$ orbits above the Fermi surface\nproducing in this way a strong increase of the total radius of the nuclear\nsystem. As a consequence, a nuclear halo can form even in cases, where non of\nthe individual low-$l$ orbits is very close to the continuum.

Received Signal Strength\n(RSS)-based localization systems are at the forefront of tracking research\napplications. Radio location fingerprinting is one of the most promising indoor\npositioning approaches due to its powerful in terms of accuracy and cost.\nHowever, fingerprinting systems require the collection of a large number of\nreference points in the tracking area to achieve reasonable localization\naccuracy. In this paper, we propose a fingerprinting localization approach\nbased on a RSS technique. The proposed system does not require gathering a\nlarge number of reference points and offers good localization accuracy indoors.\nThe implemented approach is based on dividing the tracking area into subareas\nand assigning a unique feature to each subarea through ranging the RSS values\nfrom different reference points.
