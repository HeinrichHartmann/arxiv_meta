Although electromagnetism is\nformulated successfully by quantum field theory, this paper proposes a simple\napproach to describe the electromagnetism from the macroscopic perspective of\ngeneral relativity. The hypothesis is based on two charged particles that cause\ndisturbance energy sufficient to disrupt the space-time and explain\napproximately Maxwell's equations. Therefore, with such this simple idea, we\nsuggest the possibility that the geometric relationship between\nelectromagnetism and gravitation is not yet fully exhausted.\n","Comment: 14 pages, no figures"]}]

A natural question is then: to make the\nSmart Grid a reality will the Distribution Grid have to be updated? We assume a\npositive answer to the question and we consider the lower layers of Medium and\nLow Voltage to be the most affected by the change. In our previous work, we\nhave analyzed samples of the Dutch Distribution Grid in our previous work and\nwe have considered possible evolutions of these using synthetic topologies\nmodeled after studies of complex systems in other technological domains in\nanother previous work. In this paper, we take an extra important further step\nby defining a methodology for evolving any existing physical Power Grid to a\ngood Smart Grid model thus laying the foundations for a decision support system\nfor utilities and governmental organizations. In doing so, we consider several\npossible evolution strategies and apply then to the Dutch Distribution Grid.

Hot gas in clusters, groups and\nthe intergalactic medium dominates the baryonic content of the local Universe.\nTo understand the astrophysical processes responsible for the formation and\nassembly of these large structures, it is necessary to measure their physical\nproperties and evolution.

Earlier it was shown that the quasi-energy spectra of\nthese two dynamical models (i) can exactly overlap with each other if an\neffective Planck constant takes irrational multiples of 2*pi and (ii) will be\ndifferent if the same parameter takes rational multiples of 2*pi. This work\nmakes some detailed comparisons between these two models, with an effective\nPlanck constant given by 2*pi M/N, where M and N are coprime and odd integers.\nIt is found that the ORDKR spectrum (with two periodic kicking sequences having\nthe same kick strength) has one flat band and $N-1$ non-flat bands whose\nlargest width decays in power law as K to the power of N+2, where K is a\nkicking strength parameter. The existence of a flat band is strictly proven and\nthe power law scaling, numerically checked for a number of cases, is also\nanalytically proven for a three-band case. By contrast, the KHM does not have\nany flat band and its band width scales linearly with K. This is shown to\nresult in dramatic differences in dynamical behavior, such as transient (but\nextremely long) dynamical localization in ORDKR, which is absent in KHM.\nFinally, we show that despite these differences, there exist simple extensions\nof KHM and ORDKR (upon introducing an additional periodic phase parameter) such\nthat the resulting extended KHM and ORDKR are actually topologically\nequivalent, i.e., they yield exactly the same Floquet-band Chern numbers and\ndisplay topological phase transitions at the same kick strengths.

The combination of the two distortions is responsible for\nstabilizing the strongly orthorhombic $A$-AFM insulating ($I$) $Pbnm$ ground\nstate relative to a metallic ferromagnetic (FM-$M$) phase. However, epitaxial\nstrain due to coherent matching to a crystalline substrate can change the\nrelative stability of the two states. In particular, coherent matching to a\nsquare-lattice substrate favors the less orthorhombic FM-$M$ phase, with the\n$A$-AFM phase stabilized at higher values of tensile epitaxial strain due to\nits larger volume per formula unit, resulting in a coupled magnetic and\nmetal-insulator transition at a critical strain close to 1%. At the phase\nboundary, colossal magneto-resistance is expected. Tensile epitaxial strain\nenhances the JT distortion and opens the band gap in the $A$-AFM-$I$ $c$-$Pbnm$\nphase, offering the opportunity for band-gap engineering. Compressive epitaxial\nstrain induces an orientational transition within the FM-$M$ phase from\n$c$-$Pbnm$ to $ab$-$Pbnm$ with a change in the direction of the magnetic easy\naxis relative to the substrate, yielding strain-controlled magnetization at the\nphase boundary.

The construction is based on\nan analysis of the covariant properties of the parity operator, which for these\nrepresentations transforms as the completely temporal component of a\nsymmetrical tensor of rank $2j$. The covariant properties of parity involve the\nJordan algebra of anti commutators of the Lorentz group generators which unlike\nthe Lie algebra is not universal.

This\ncovariant basis provides an inventory of all the possible interaction terms for\ngauge and non-gauge theories of fields for these representations. In\nparticular, it supplies a single second rank antisymmetric structure, which in\nthe Poincar\\'e projector formalism implies a single Pauli term arising from\ngauge interactions and a single (free) parameter $g$, the gyromagnetic factor.\nThis simple structure predicts that for an elementary particle in this\nformalism all multipole moments, $Q^{l}_{E}$ and $Q^{l}_{M}$, are dictated by\nthe complete algebraic structure of the Lorentz generators and the value of\n$g$.

Our main\ntechnical contribution is a deterministic 2^O(n)-time and poly(n)-space\nconstruction of thin lattice coverings of space with respect to any convex\nbody, where enumeration in these lattices can be efficiently performed using\npoly(n)-space. This also yields the first existential construction of\npoly(n)-space enumerable thin covering lattices for general convex bodies,\nwhich we believe is of independent interest. Our construction combines the use\nof the M-ellipsoid from convex geometry with lattice sparsification and\ndensification techniques.\n  As an application, we give a 2^O(n)(1+1/eps)^n time and poly(n)-space\ndeterministic algorithm for computing a (1+eps)^n approximation to the volume\nof a general convex body, which nearly matches the lower bounds for volume\nestimation in the oracle model (the dependence on eps is larger by a factor 2\nin the exponent). This improves on the previous results of Dadush and Vempala\n[PNAS 2013], which gave the above result only for symmetric bodies and achieved\na dependence on eps of (1+log^{5/2}(1/eps)/eps^2)^n.\n"]}]

For close-in\nplanets and satellites, the rotation slowly evolves due to dissipative tidal\neffects until some kind of equilibrium is reached. When the orbits are nearly\ncircular, the rotation period is believed to always end synchronous with the\norbital period.

These ideas are simultaneously both seductively simple and perilously\nsubtle to grasp completely. The energy landscape theory of protein folding\nprovides a framework for quantifying frustration in large systems and has been\nimplemented at many levels of description.

We discuss then how the frustration concept applies\nspecifically to heteropolymers, testing folding landscape theory in computer\nsimulations of protein models and in experimentally accessible systems.\nStudying the aspects of frustration averaged over many proteins provides ways\nto infer energy functions useful for reliable structure prediction. We discuss\nhow frustration affects folding, how a large part of the biological functions\nof proteins are related to subtle local frustration effects and how frustration\ninfluences the appearance of metastable states, the nature of binding\nprocesses, catalysis and allosteric transitions.
