Despite its\npotential, the intrinsic long scan times of these sequences have hampered their\nuse in clinical practice. For this reason, a large variety of methods have been\nrecently proposed to shorten the acquisition times. Among them, spherical\ndeconvolution approaches have gained a lot of interest for their ability to\nreliably recover the intra-voxel fiber configuration with a relatively small\nnumber of data samples. To overcome the intrinsic instabilities of\ndeconvolution, these methods use regularization schemes generally based on the\nassumption that the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) to be recovered in\neach voxel is sparse. The well known Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)\napproach resorts to Tikhonov regularization, based on an l2-norm prior, which\npromotes a weak version of sparsity. Also, in the last few years compressed\nsensing has been advocated to further accelerate the acquisitions and l1-norm\nminimization is generally employed as a means to promote sparsity in the\nrecovered FODs. In this paper, we provide evidence that the use of an l1-norm\nprior to regularize this class of problems is somewhat inconsistent with the\nfact that the fiber compartments all sum up to unity. To overcome this l1\ninconsistency while simultaneously exploiting sparsity more optimally than\nthrough an l2 prior, we reformulate the reconstruction problem as a constrained\nformulation between a data term and and a sparsity prior consisting in an\nexplicit bound on the l0 norm of the FOD, i.e. on the number of fibers.

This is best achieved through appropriately\nconstrained solar dynamo simulations and as such the first step towards\npredictions is to understand the underlying physics of the solar dynamo\nmechanism. In Babcock-Leighton type dynamo models, the poloidal field is\ngenerated near the solar surface whereas the toroidal field is generated in the\nsolar interior. Therefore a finite time is necessary for the coupling of the\nspatially segregated source layers of the dynamo. This time delay introduces a\nmemory in the dynamo mechanism which allows forecasting of future solar\nactivity. Here we discuss how this forecasting ability of the solar cycle is\naffected by downward turbulent pumping of magnetic flux.

Harnessing the benefits of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic level\nwould revolutionize fields ranging from telecommunication to biology, the\nlatter focused on here for reasons discussed. Contrary to misconceptions, there\nare no known physical laws that prevent the development of MQS. Instead, they\nare generally believed universally lost in complex systems from environmental\nentanglements (decoherence). But we argue success is achievable MQS with\ndecoherence compensation developed, naturally or artificially, from top-down\nrather current reductionist approaches. This paper advances the MQS field by a\ncomplex systems approach to decoherence. First, why complex system decoherence\napproaches (top-down) are needed is discussed. Specifically, complex adaptive\nsystems (CAS) are not amenable to reductionist models (and their master\nequations) because of emergent behavior, approximation failures, not accounting\nfor quantum compensator mechanisms, ignoring path integrals, and the subentity\nproblem. In addition, since MQS must exist within the context of the classical\nworld, rapid decoherence and prolonged coherence are both needed. Nature has\nalready demonstrated this for quantum subsystems such as photosynthesis and\nmagnetoreception. Second, we perform a preliminary study that illustrates a\ntop-down approach to potential MQS. In summary, reductionist arguments against\nMQS are not justifiable. It is more likely they are not easily detectable in\nlarge intact classical systems or has been destroyed by reductionist\nexperimental set-ups.

For the\nestimation of an $n$-dimensional mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in the\nGaussian sequence model, is it possible to find an adaptive optimal threshold\nestimator in a full range of sparsity levels where nonadaptive optimality can\nbe achieved by threshold estimators? We provide an explicit affirmative answer\nas follows. Under the squared loss, adaptive minimaxity in strong and weak\n$\\ell_p$ balls with $0\\le p<2$ is achieved by a class of smooth threshold\nestimators with the threshold level of the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR rule or its a\ncertain approximation, provided that the minimax risk is between\n$n^{-\\delta_n}$ and $\\delta_n n$ for some $\\delta_n\\to 0$.

The class of smooth threshold estimators\nincludes the soft and firm threshold estimators but not the hard threshold\nestimator. The adaptive minimaxity in such a wide range is a delicate problem\nsince the same is not true for the FDR hard threshold estimator at certain\nthreshold and nominal FDR levels. The above adaptive minimaxity of the FDR\nsmooth-threshold estimator is established by proving a stronger notion of\nadaptive ratio optimality for the soft threshold estimator in the sense that\nthe risk for the FDR threshold level is uniformly within an infinitesimal\nfraction of the risk for the optimal threshold level for each unknown vector,\nwhen the minimum risk of nonadaptive soft threshold estimator is between\n$n^{-\\delta_n}$ and $\\delta_n n$.

We consider the case where the target can move with speed at most\n1, according to any continuous function and can adapt its motion based on the\nlocation of the particles. We show that there exists sufficiently small\n$\\lambda_* > 0$, so that if the initial density of particles $\\lambda <\n\\lambda_*$, then the target can avoid detection forever.\n"]}]

In the present study we develop a\nstatistical model using real data to identify the attributable variables (risk\nfactors) that cause the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere in Europe. Some\nscientists believe that there are more than nineteen attributable variables\nthat cause the CO2 in our atmosphere. However, our study has identified only\nthree individual risk factors and five interactions among the attributable\nvariables that cause almost all the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere in Europe.\nWe rank the risk factors and interactions according to the amount of CO2 they\ngenerate. In addition, we compare the present findings of the European data\nwith a similar study for the Continental United States [1, 2]. For example, in\nthe US, liquid fuels ranks number one, while in Europe is gas fuels. In fact,\nliquid fuels in Europe is the least contributable variable of CO2 in the\natmosphere, and gas fuels ranks seventh.\n"]}]
