A common thread to most genetic\ninvestigations is familial relationships. Close relatives can be identified\nfrom family records, and more distant relatives can be inferred from large\npanels of genetic markers. Unfortunately these empirical estimates can be\nnoisy, especially regarding distant relatives. We propose a new method for\ndenoising genetically - inferred relationship matrices by exploiting the\nunderlying structure due to hierarchical groupings of correlated individuals.\nThe approach, which we call Treelet Covariance Smoothing, employs a multiscale\ndecomposition of covariance matrices to improve estimates of pairwise\nrelationships. On both simulated and real data, we show that smoothing leads to\nbetter estimates of the relatedness amongst distantly related individuals. We\nillustrate our method with a large genome-wide association study and estimate\nthe \"heritability\" of body mass index quite accurately. Traditionally\nheritability, defined as the fraction of the total trait variance attributable\nto additive genetic effects, is estimated from samples of closely related\nindividuals using random effects models. We show that by using smoothed\nrelationship matrices we can estimate heritability using population-based\nsamples. Finally, while our methods have been developed for refining genetic\nrelationship matrices and improving estimates of heritability, they have much\nbroader potential application in statistics.

Traditionally such networks were modeled\ndeterministically, but it is now well-established that when reactant copy\nnumbers are small, the random timing of the reactions create internal noise\nthat can significantly affect the macroscopic properties of the system. To\nunderstand the role of noise and quantify its effects, stochastic models are\nnecessary. In the stochastic setting, the population is described by a\nprobability distribution, which evolves according to a set of ordinary\ndifferential equations known as the Chemical Master Equation (CME). This set is\ninfinite in most cases making the CME practically unsolvable. In many\napplications, it is important to determine if the solution of a CME has a\nglobally attracting fixed point.

This variation\nallows transducer networks to compute more queries in a coordination-free\nmanner: e.g., a transducer can check whether a ground atom $A$ over the input\nschema is in the \"scope\" of the local node, and then send either $A$ or $\\neg\nA$ to other nodes.\n  We show the surprising result that the query given by the well-founded\nsemantics of the unstratifiable win-move program is coordination-free in some\nof the models we consider. We also show that the original transducer network\nmodel [9] and our variants form a strict hierarchy of classes of\ncoordination-free queries. Finally, we identify different syntactic fragments\nof Datalog${}^{\\neg\\neg}_{\\forall}$, called semi-monotone programs, which can\nbe used as declarative network programming languages, whose distributed\ncomputation is guaranteed to be eventually consistent and coordination-free.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Database Theory.\n  Pages 99-113.

The lack of optical depth variations between\nultraviolet and near-IR wavelengths indicate a lack of micron-sized particles.\nBetween these two regimes, the particle-size distribution is largely unknown. A\ncutoff where the particle-size distribution turns over must exist, but the\nposition and shape of it is not clear from existing studies.\n  Using a series of solar occultations performed by the VIMS instrument\non-board Cassini in the near-infrared, we are able to measure light forward\nscattered by particles in the A and C rings. With a model of diffraction by\nring particles, and the previous radio work as a constraint on the slope of the\nparticle size distribution, we estimate the minimum particle size using a\ntruncated power-law size distribution. The C Ring shows a minimum particle size\nof $4.1^{+3.8}_{-1.3}$ mm, with an assumed power law index of q=3.1 and a\nmaximum particle size of 10 m.\n  The A Ring signal shows a similar level of scattered flux, but modeling is\ncomplicated by the presence of self-gravity wakes and higher optical depths. If\nq<3, our A Ring model requires a minimum particle size below one millimeter (<\n0.34 mm for an assumed q=2.75, or $0.56^{+0.35}_{-0.16}$ mm for a steeper\nq=2.9) to be consistent with VIMS observations. These results might seem to\ncontradict previous optical(Dones et al., 1993) and infrared (French and\nNicholson, 2000) work, which implied that there were few particles in the A\nRing smaller than 1 cm. But, because of the shallow power law, relatively\nlittle optical depth (between 0.03 and 0.16 in extinction, or 0.015 - 0.08 in\nabsorption) is provided by these particles.\n","Comment: 47 pages, 16 figures, 3 Tables"]}]
