We find that the logarithm of\nthe time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors, a vector\ncharacterising the distribution of patch population sizes in the quasi-steady\nstate, and a vector -- related to Fisher's reproduction vector -- that\nquantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state distribution to\ndemographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical results to stochastic\nsimulations of the model, and discuss the range of validity of the analytical\nexpressions. By identifying fast and slow degrees of freedom in the\nmetapopulation dynamics, we show that the dynamics of large metapopulations\nclose to extinction is approximately described by a deterministic equation\noriginally proposed by Levins (1969). We were able to compute the rates in\nLevins' equation in terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based\nmodel. It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable\ndepends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of the\npatches. Only when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are large does the\nslow variable correspond to the number of patches, as envisaged by Levins. Last\nbut not least, we discuss how our findings relate to other, widely used\nmetapopulation models.\n","Comment: Revised version, as published. 66 pages, 15 figures, 1 table"]}]

On the other hand, it is\npossible to exclude the presence of dark streams with linear mass densities\nhigher than $\\lambda_{\\rm st}> 10^{-10} \\Msun/\\AU$ (about the Earth mass spread\nalong the diameter of the SS up to the Kuiper belt). In addition, we review the\ndynamics of wide binaries inside the dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the MW. The\ndynamics of such kind of binaries seem to be compatible with the presence of a\nhuge fraction of dark sub-structure, thus their existence is not a sharp\ndiscriminant of the dark matter hypothesis as been claimed before. However,\nthere are regimes where the constraints from different astrophysical systems\nmay reveal the sub-structure mass function cut-off scale.\n","Comment: 28 pages.

Recently, a lot of interest has been devoted to desynchronizing\ndelayed feedback deep brain stimulation (DBS). This type of synchrony control\nwas shown to destabilize the synchronized state in networks of simple model\noscillators as well as in networks of coupled model neurons. However, the\ndynamics of the neural activity in Parkinson's disease exhibits complex\nintermittent synchronous patterns, far from the idealized synchronous dynamics\nused to study the delayed feedback stimulation. This study explores the action\nof delayed feedback stimulation on partially synchronized oscillatory dynamics,\nsimilar to what one observes experimentally in parkinsonian patients. We employ\na model of the basal ganglia networks which reproduces experimentally observed\nfine temporal structure of the synchronous dynamics. When the parameters of our\nmodel are such that the synchrony is unphysiologically strong, the feedback\nexerts a desynchronizing action. However, when the network is tuned to\nreproduce the highly variable temporal patterns observed experimentally, the\nsame kind of delayed feedback may actually increase the synchrony. As network\nparameters are changed from the range which produces complete synchrony to\nthose favoring less synchronous dynamics, desynchronizing delayed feedback may\ngradually turn into synchronizing stimulation. This suggests that delayed\nfeedback DBS in Parkinson's disease may boost rather than suppress\nsynchronization and is unlikely to be clinically successful. The study also\nindicates that delayed feedback stimulation may not necessarily exhibit a\ndesynchronization effect when acting on a physiologically realistic partially\nsynchronous dynamics, and provides an example of how to estimate the\nstimulation effect.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Consequently, the\nregion from the null charge surface to the light cylinder is dominated by the\noutflow of particles and that from the null charge surface to the star is\ndominated by the inflow of particles. The inflow and outflow of particles move\nalong the magnetic field lines and emit curvature photons, and the incoming\ncurvature photons are converted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the\nstar. These pairs emit synchrotron photons. We suggest that the X-rays and soft\ngamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these\npairs, and the viewing angle of PSR B1509-58 only receives the inflow\nradiation. The magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes\nthe pulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the\ncurvature radiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron\nradiation with different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the\nlight curves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of\nthe secondary pairs, and the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the\nregion near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows the pair\ncreation to happen with a smaller pitch angle.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 8 figures, 2012 Fermi Symposium proceedings - eConf C121028"]}]

In these paper the\ndifferent stages are formed, firstly the document preprocessing is done by\nremoving stop words, stemming is performed using porter stemmer algorithm, word\nnet thesaurus is applied for maintaining relationship between the important\nterms, global unique words, and frequent word sets get generated, Secondly,\ndata matrix is formed, and thirdly terms are extracted from the documents by\nusing term selection approaches tf-idf, tf-df, and tf2 based on their minimum\nthreshold value. Further each and every document terms gets preprocessed, where\nthe frequency of each term within the document is counted for representation.\nThe purpose of this approach is to reduce the attributes and find the effective\nterm selection method using WordNet for better clustering accuracy.

In the present work we\ninvestigate the stability of boundary layer in Poiseuille flow. We normalize\npressure and time by inertial and viscous effects. The disturbances are taken\nto be periodic in the spanwise direction and time. We present a set of linear\ngoverning equations for the parabolic evolution of wavelike disturbances. Then,\nwe derive modified Orr-Sommerfeld equations that can be applied in the layer.\nContrary to what one might think, we find that Squire's theorem is not\napplicable for the boundary layer. We find also that normalization by inertial\nor viscous effects leads to the same order of stability or instability. For the\n2D disturbances flow ($\\theta=0$), we found the same critical Reynolds number\nfor our two normalizations. This value coincides with the one we know for\nneutral stability of the known Orr-Sommerfeld equation. We noticed also that\nfor all overs values of $k$ in the case $\\theta=0$ correspond the same values\nof $Re_\\delta$ at $c_i=0$ whatever the normalization. We therefore conclude\nthat in the boundary layer with a 2D-disturbance, we have the same neutral\nstability curve whatever the normalization. We find also that for a flow with\nhight hydrodynamic Reynolds number, the neu- tral disturbances in the boundary\nlayer are two-dimensional.

Then they\nconcluded that their scheme is an unconditional secure scheme. Actually, note\nthat the authentication tag in the scheme of Oggier and Fathi is nearly linear\non the messages, so it is very easy for any malicious node to make pollution\nattack in the network flow, replacing the vector of any incoming edge by linear\ncombination of his incoming vectors whose coefficients have sum 1. And if the\ncoalition of malicious nodes can carry out decoding of the network coding, they\ncan easily make substitution attack to any other node even if they do not know\nany information of the private key of the node. Moreover, even if their scheme\ncan work fruitfully, the condition in their scheme $H\\leqslant M$ in a network\ncan be removed, where $H$ is the sum of numbers of the incoming edges at\nadversaries.

A key issue in\nthese settings, where direct monitoring is infeasible, is incentivizing agents\nin the `crowd' to put in effort to make good evaluations, as well as to\ntruthfully report their evaluations. This leads to a new family of information\nelicitation problems with unobservable ground truth, where an agent's\nproficiency- the probability with which she correctly evaluates the underlying\nground truth- is endogenously determined by her strategic choice of how much\neffort to put into the task.\n  Our main contribution is a simple, new, mechanism for binary information\nelicitation for multiple tasks when agents have endogenous proficiencies, with\nthe following properties: (i) Exerting maximum effort followed by truthful\nreporting of observations is a Nash equilibrium. (ii) This is the equilibrium\nwith maximum payoff to all agents, even when agents have different maximum\nproficiencies, can use mixed strategies, and can choose a different strategy\nfor each of their tasks. Our information elicitation mechanism requires only\nminimal bounds on the priors, asks agents to only report their own evaluations,\nand does not require any conditions on a diverging number of agent reports per\ntask to achieve its incentive properties. The main idea behind our mechanism is\nto use the presence of multiple tasks and ratings to identify and penalize\nlow-effort agreement: the mechanism rewards agents for agreeing with a\n`reference' rater on a task but also penalizes for blind agreement by\nsubtracting out a statistic term designed so that agents obtain reward only\nwhen they put effort into their observations.\n","Comment: To appear in WWW 2013"]}]
