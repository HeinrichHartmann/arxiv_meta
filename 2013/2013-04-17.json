The fields acting on the trailing\ncharges are known as (geometric) wakefields. We model a bunch of particles as a\none dimensional continuum of point charges and by calculating the accumulated\nLienard-Wiechert fields we address the possibility of reducing wakefields at a\ncollimator interface by altering the path of the beam prior to collimation.\nThis approach is facilitated by the highly relativistic regime in which lepton\naccelerators operate, where the Coulomb field given from the Lienard-Wiechert\npotential is highly collimated in the direction of motion. It will be seen that\nthe potential reduction depends upon the ratio of the bunch length to the width\nof the collimator aperture as well as the relativistic factor and path of the\nbeam.

First, it is found with very high statistical significance that cost\nescalation is strongly dependent on length of implementation phase.

The AMoRE (Advanced Mo based Rare process Experiment) collaboration\nplans to use 40Ca100MoO4 scintillation crystals as a detector for search of\n0n2b decay of 100Mo isotope. A purpose of this paper is further investigation\nof internal background of 40Ca100MoO4 scintillation elements with a low\nbackground setup at YangYang underground laboratory.

Thereby the material properties of multiphase systems, such as the\nline tension and the bending moduli, are crucially involved in the kinetics and\nthe asymptotic behavior of phase separation. In this Letter we present a\ncombined analytical and experimental approach to determine the properties of\nphase-separated vesicle systems. First we develop an analytical model for the\nvesicle shape of weakly budded biphasic vesicles. Subsequently experimental\ndata on vesicle shape and membrane fluctuations are taken and compared to the\nmodel. The combined approach allows for a reproducible and reliable\ndetermination of the physical parameters of complex vesicle systems. The\nparameters obtained set limits for the size and stability of nanodomains in the\nplasma membrane of living cells.\n","Comment: (*) authors contributed equally, 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table; added\n  insets to figure 3"]}]
