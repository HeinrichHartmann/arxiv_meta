Such processes have been used as models for the spread of ideas or\ntrends within a network of individuals.\n  We analyse bootstrap percolation process in the case where the underlying\ngraph is an inhomogeneous random graph, which exhibits a power-law degree\ndistribution, and initially there are $a(n)$ randomly infected nodes.

The main result of this work is that if the degree\nsequence of the random graph follows a power law with exponent $\\beta$, where\n$2 < \\beta < 3$, then a sublinear number of initially infected vertices is\nenough to spread the infection over a linear fraction of the nodes of the\nrandom graph, with high probability.\n  More specifically, we determine explicitly a critical function $a_c(n)$ such\nthat $a_c(n)=o(n)$ with the following property. Assuming that $n$ is the number\nof vertices of the underlying random graph, if $a(n) \\ll a_c(n)$, then the\nprocess does not evolve at all, with high probability as $n$ grows, whereas if\n$a(n)\\gg a_c(n)$, then there is a constant $\\eps>0$ such that, with high\nprobability, the final set of infected vertices has size at least $\\eps n$.
