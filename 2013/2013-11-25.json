We construct a\n(two-sided) BCS based on the support function of the identified set. We prove\nthe Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the support\nfunction. This powerful result in turn infers that, while the BCS and the\nfrequentist confidence set for the partially identified parameter are\nasymptotically different, our constructed BCS for the identified set has an\nasymptotically correct frequentist coverage probability. Importantly, we\nillustrate that the constructed BCS for the identified set does not require a\nprior on the structural parameter.

Hence, the proposed methods are useful in many applications.\n  The Bayesian partial identification literature has been assuming a known\nparametric likelihood function. However, econometric models usually only\nidentify a set of moment inequalities, and therefore using an incorrect\nlikelihood function may result in misleading inferences. In contrast, with a\nnonparametric prior on the unknown likelihood function, our proposed Bayesian\nprocedure only requires a set of moment conditions, and can efficiently make\ninference about both the partially identified parameter and its identified set.\nThis makes it widely applicable in general moment inequality models.

The objective function is a generalized\nKullback-Leibler divergence, depending on both the unknown object and unknown\npoint spread function (PSF), without the addition of regularization terms;\nconstrained minimization, with suitable convex constraints on both unknowns, is\nconsidered. The problem is nonconvex and we propose to solve it by means of an\ninexact alternating minimization method, whose global convergence to stationary\npoints of the objective function has been recently proved in a general setting.\nThe method is iterative and each iteration, also called outer iteration,\nconsists of alternating an update of the object and the PSF by means of fixed\nnumbers of iterations, also called inner iterations, of the scaled gradient\nprojection (SGP) method. The use of SGP has two advantages: first, it allows to\nprove global convergence of the blind method; secondly, it allows the\nintroduction of different constraints on the object and the PSF. The specific\nconstraint on the PSF, besides non-negativity and normalization, is an upper\nbound derived from the so-called Strehl ratio, which is the ratio between the\npeak value of an aberrated versus a perfect wavefront. Therefore a typical\napplication is the imaging of modern telescopes equipped with adaptive optics\nsystems for partial correction of the aberrations due to atmospheric\nturbulence. In the paper we describe the algorithm and we recall the results\nleading to its convergence. Moreover we illustrate its effectiveness by means\nof numerical experiments whose results indicate that the method, pushed to\nconvergence, is very promising in the reconstruction of non-dense stellar\nclusters.

In PNC, multiple users\ntransmit to a relay simultaneously. PNC channel decoding is different from\nconventional multi-user channel decoding: specifically, the PNC relay aims to\ndecode a network-coded message rather than the individual messages of the\nusers. Although prior work has shown that PNC can significantly improve the\nthroughput of a relay network, the improvement is predicated on the\navailability of accurate channel estimates. Channel estimation in PNC, however,\ncan be particularly challenging because of 1) the overlapped signals of\nmultiple users; 2) the correlations among data symbols induced by channel\ncoding; and 3) time-varying channels. We combine the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm and belief propagation (BP) algorithm on a unified factor-graph\nframework to tackle these challenges. In this framework, channel estimation is\nperformed by an EM subgraph, and channel decoding is performed by a BP subgraph\nthat models a virtual encoder matched to the target of PNC channel decoding.\nIterative message passing between these two subgraphs allow the optimal\nsolutions for both to be approached progressively.

However, their progenitors are still uncertain. We study\nwhether the population properties of this class might be understood if the\nevents originate from a subset of sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions.

Although the notion of graph entropy has\nits roots in information theory, it was proved to be closely related to some\nclassical and frequently studied graph theoretic concepts.

Neutrino oscillations have provided indisputable\nevidence in favour of non-zero neutrino masses and mixings. However, the\noriginal formulation of the Standard Model cannot account for these\nobservations, which calls for the introduction of new Physics. Among many\npossibilities, we focus here on the inverse seesaw, a neutrino mass generation\nmechanism in which the Standard Model is extended with fermionic gauge\nsinglets. This model offers an attractive alternative to the usual seesaw\nrealisations since it can potentially have natural Yukawa couplings\n($\\mathcal{O}(1)$) while keeping the new Physics scale at energies within reach\nof the LHC. Among the many possible effects, this scenario can lead to\ndeviations from lepton flavour universality. We have investigated these\nsignatures and found that the ratios $R_K$ and $R_\\pi$ provide new, additional\nconstraints on the inverse seesaw. We have also considered the embedding of the\ninverse seesaw in supersymmetric models. This leads to increased rates for\nvarious lepton flavour violating processes, due to enhanced contributions from\npenguin diagrams mediated by the Higgs and $Z^0$ bosons. Finally, we also found\nthat the new invisible decay channels associated with the sterile neutrinos\npresent in the supersymmetric inverse seesaw could significantly weaken the\nconstraints on the mass and couplings of a light CP-odd Higgs boson.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, Univ.
