A practical solution to the\nproblem has been proposed aggregating the bandwidth of 802.11 Access Points\n(APs) backhauls in range via 802.11 connections. Since 802.11 devices are\nusually single-radio, the communication to multiple APs on different\nradio-channels requires the introduction of a time-division multiple access\n(TDMA) policy at the client station. Current investigation in this area\nsupposes that there is a sufficient number of TCP flows to saturate the\nAsymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) behind the APs. However, this may be\nnot guaranteed according to the user traffic pattern. As a consequence, a TDMA\npolicy introduces additional delays in the end-to-end transmissions that will\ncause degradation of the TCP throughput and an under-utilization of the AP\nbackhauls. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth experimental analysis\nwith a customized 802.11 driver of how the usage of multi-AP TDMA affects the\nobserved Round-Trip-Time (RTT) of TCP flows. Then, we introduce a simple\nanalytical model that accurately predicts the TCP RTT when accessing the\nwireless medium with a Multi-AP TDMA policy. Based on this model, we propose a\nresource allocation algorithm that runs locally at the station and it greatly\nreduces the observed TCP RTT with a very low computational cost. Our proposed\nscheme can improve up to 1:5 times the aggregate throughput observed by the\nstation compared to state-of-the-art multi-AP TDMA allocations.

To address this problem, in\nthis paper we propose a novel discriminative sparse coding method based on\nmulti-manifold, by learning discriminative class-conditional codebooks and\nsparse codes from both data feature space and class labels. First, the entire\ntraining set is partitioned into multiple manifolds according to the class\nlabels. Then, we formulate the sparse coding as a manifold-manifold matching\nproblem and learn class-conditional codebooks and codes to maximize the\nmanifold margins of different classes.

In this paper, we investigate efficient strategies towards optimizing\nthe pairing of access nodes with users as well as linear precoding designs for\nproviding fair QoS experience across the whole network, when data sharing is\nlimited due to complexity and overhead constraints. We propose a method for\nobtaining the exact optimal spatial resources allocation solution which can be\napplied in networks of limited scale, as well as an approximation algorithm\nwith bounded polynomial complexity which can be used in larger networks. The\nparticular algorithm outperforms existing user-oriented clustering techniques\nand achieves quite high quality-of-service levels with reasonable complexity.\n","Comment: submitted to Globecom 2013 - Wireless Communications Symposium"]}]

Pioneering work by Lucks and colleagues\nhas expanded this method to probe hundreds of molecules at once on an Illumina\nsequencing platform, obviating the use of slab gels or capillary\nelectrophoresis on one molecule at a time. Here, we describe optimizations to\nthis method from our lab, resulting in the MAP-seq protocol (Multiplexed\nAccessibility Probing read out through sequencing), version 1.0. The protocol\npermits the quantitative probing of thousands of RNAs at once, by several\nchemical modification reagents, on the time scale of a day using a table-top\nIllumina machine. This method and a software package MAPseeker\n(http://simtk.org/home/map_seeker) address several potential sources of bias,\nby eliminating PCR steps, improving ligation efficiencies of ssDNA adapters,\nand avoiding problematic heuristics in prior algorithms. We hope that the\nstep-by-step description of MAP-seq 1.0 will help other RNA mapping\nlaboratories to transition from electrophoretic to next-generation sequencing\nmethods and to further reduce the turnaround time and any remaining biases of\nthe protocol.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In the classical setting of cooperative games, it is\ngenerally assumed that all coalitions can form, i.e., they are all feasible. In\nmany situations, this assumption is too strong and one has to deal with some\nunfeasible coalitions. Defining a game on a subcollection of the power set of\nthe set of players has many implications on the mathematical structure of the\ncore, depending on the precise structure of the subcollection of feasible\ncoalitions.

We show that this same relationship can be\nobtained by using upper limit data or by randomizing the radio fluxes. In those\ncases, the relationship arises because one is effectively plotting distance vs\ndistance in a flux-limited sample of objects. To correctly establish a\nrelationship between L_R, L_X, and M_BH, one would need to analyze a\nvolume-limited sample of objects. The distance effect can be removed from the\nsample, where a relationship between L_R/L_X and M_BH is found, showing that\nthe L_R rises more quickly than L_X with increasing M_BH. However, until a\nwell-define sample is used, it is unclear the degree to which this relationship\nis influenced by the sample-selection.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author and is superseded by\n  recent works"]}]
