While slip conditions at the walls seem to\nhave a negligible influence on the fluidization time $\\tau_f$, different\nfluidization processes are observed depending on $\\gp$ and $e$: the shear band\nremains almost stationary for several hours at low shear rates or small gap\nwidths before strong fluctuations lead to a homogeneous flow, whereas at larger\nvalues of $\\gp$ or $e$, the transient shear band is seen to invade the whole\ngap in a much smoother way. Still, the power-law behaviour appears as very\nrobust and hints to critical-like dynamics. To further discuss these results,\nwe propose (i) a qualitative scenario to explain the induction-like period that\nprecedes full fluidization and (ii) an analogy with critical phenomena that\nnaturally leads to the observed power laws if one assumes that the yield point\nis the critical point of an underlying out-of-equilibrium phase transition.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14+2 figures, published in Soft Matter"]}]

The coupling of stellar wind with its\nmagnetic field, i.e., magnetic braking, is the most promising mechanism to\ndrive AML in these stars. There are basically two properties driving magnetic\nbraking: the stellar magnetic field and the stellar wind. Understanding the\nmechanisms that drive AML therefore requires a comprehensive understanding of\nthese two properties.

Brownian ratchets are\nfundamental in various biochemical processes, and are roughly divided into two\ncategories: active (usually ATP-powered) molecular motors and passive\nconstructions with a directional bias, where the transport is driven by thermal\nmotion. In this paper we discuss the latter process, of spontaneous\ntranslocation of molecules (Brownian particles) by ratcheted diffusion with no\nexternal energy input: a problem relevant for protein translocation along\nbacterial flagella or injectosome complex, or DNA translocation by\nbacteriophages.

In this regime the particle density in the channel\nreaches a constant saturation level and the resistance force increases\nsubstantially, due to the osmotic pressure build-up. To achieve a steady-state\ntransport, the apparatus that injects new particles into a crowded channel has\nto operate with an increasing power consumption, proportional to the length of\nthe channel and the required rate of transport.

We implement a Monte\nCarlo calculation of the Stokes parameters with the use of the non-LTE\nradiative transfer code of Sigut & Jones (2007) to reproduce the continuous\npolarimetric spectra of classical Be stars. The scattering of light in the\nnonspherical circumstellar envelopes of classical Be stars produces a distinct\npolarization signature that can be used to study the physical nature of the\nscattering environment. In this paper, we highlight the utility of polarimetric\nmeasurements as important diagnostics in the modeling of these systems. We\nillustrate the effects of using self-consistent calculation of the thermal\nstructure of the circumstellar gas on the characteristic wavelength-dependence\nof the polarization spectrum. In showing that the principal features of the\npolarization spectrum originate from different parts of the disk, we emphasize\nthe capability of polarimetric observations to trace the evolution of the disk\non critical scales. We produce models that approximate the disk formation and\ndissipation periods and illustrate how the polarimetric properties of these\nsystems can have a pivotal role in determining the mechanism for mass decretion\nfrom the central star.\n","Comment: Accepted to ApJ on January 15, 2013"]}]

Physical mechanisms\nleading to this relaxation of spin memory typically involve either coupling of\nthe electron spin to its orbital motion or to nuclear spins. Relaxation of\nconfined electron spin has been previously measured only for Zeeman or exchange\nsplit spin states, where spin-orbit effects dominate relaxation, while spin\nflips due to nuclei have been observed in optical spectroscopy studies. Using\nan isolated GaAs double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates and direct\ntime domain measurements, we investigate in detail spin relaxation for\narbitrary splitting of spin states.
