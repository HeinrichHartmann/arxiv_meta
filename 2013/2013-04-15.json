The above two steps produce a set of generators with\nequivalent error-correcting properties to those of the original generators. We\nthen demonstrate how to perform online encoding and decoding for a stream of\ninformation qubits, halves of ebits, and ancilla qubits.

An appealing representation is the influence\ndiagram, a network that makes explicit the random variables in a model and\ntheir probabilistic dependencies. Recent advances have developed solution\nprocedures based on the influence diagram. In this paper, we examine the\nfundamental properties that underlie those techniques, and the information\nabout the probabilistic structure that is available in the influence diagram\nrepresentation. The influence diagram is a convenient representation for\ncomputer processing while also being clear and non-mathematical. It displays\nprobabilistic dependence precisely, in a way that is intuitive for decision\nmakers and experts to understand and communicate. As a result, the same\ninfluence diagram can be used to build, assess and analyze a model,\nfacilitating changes in the formulation and feedback from sensitivity analysis.\nThe goal in this paper is to determine arbitrary conditional probability\ndistributions from a given probabilistic model. Given qualitative information\nabout the dependence of the random variables in the model we can, for a\nspecific conditional expression, specify precisely what quantitative\ninformation we need to be able to determine the desired conditional probability\ndistribution. It is also shown how we can find that probability distribution by\nperforming operations locally, that is, over subspaces of the joint\ndistribution. In this way, we can exploit the conditional independence present\nin the model to avoid having to construct or manipulate the full joint\ndistribution. These results are extended to include maximal processing when the\ninformation available is incomplete, and optimal decision making in an\nuncertain environment. Influence diagrams as a computer-aided modeling tool\nwere developed by Miller, Merkofer, and Howard [5] and extended by Howard and\nMatheson [2]. Good descriptions of how to use them in modeling are in Owen [7]\nand Howard and Matheson [2]. The notion of solving a decision problem through\ninfluence diagrams was examined by Olmsted [6] and such an algorithm was\ndeveloped by Shachter [8]. The latter paper also shows how influence diagrams\ncan be used to perform a variety of sensitivity analyses. This paper extends\nthose results by developing a theory of the properties of the diagram that are\nused by the algorithm, and the information needed to solve arbitrary\nprobability inference problems. Section 2 develops the notation and the\nframework for the paper and the relationship between influence diagrams and\njoint probability distributions. The general probabilistic inference problem is\nposed in Section 3. In Section 4 the transformations on the diagram are\ndeveloped and then put together into a solution procedure in Section 5.

The\nsame data would enable a wealth of other science, including detection of\nisolated black holes, systematic study of brown-dwarf binaries, a pre-explosion\nlightcurve of the next Galactic supernova, pre-explosion lightcurves of stellar\nmergers, early nova lightcurves, proper motions of many more stars than can be\nreached by GAIA, and probably much more.

However, it has been pointed out that the initial seed laser\nnoise will be amplified by the frequency up-conversion process, which may\ndegrade the quality of the output radiation produced by a harmonic generation\nscheme. In this paper, theoretical and simulation studies for laser phase error\namplification in seeded FEL schemes with slippage effect taken into account are\npresented. It is found that, the seed laser imperfection experienced by the\nelectron beam can be significantly smoothed by the slippage effect in the\nmodulator when the slippage length is comparable to the laser pulse length.\nThis smoothing effect allows one to preserve the excellent temporal coherence\nof seeded FELs in presence of large laser phase errors. For ultra-short UV seed\nlasers with FWHM around 16 fs, the slippage length in a modulator with ~30\nundulator periods is typically comparable to the laser width; for longer seed\nlaser pulses with FWHM around 80 fs, the slippage length can be made comparable\nto the laser width using a modulator tuned at the sub-harmonic of the UV seed\nlaser. Three-dimensional simulations have been carried out for a soft x-ray\nfacility using seed laser pulses with large frequency chirp and the results\nshow that the sensitivity of the bandwidth of the seeded FEL to the initial\nfrequency chirp can be significantly reduced by a proper design of the\nmodulator such that the slippage length is comparable to the laser width.
