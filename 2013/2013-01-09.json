We simulate the fluctuation dynamo\n(FD) in periodic boxes up to resolutions of 512^3, with varying fluid and\nmagnetic Reynolds numbers, and measure the resulting random RMs. We show that,\neven though the magnetic field generated is intermittent, it still allows for\ncontributions to the RM to be significant.

This level of RM dispersion obtains across different\nvalues of magnetic Reynolds number and Prandtl number explored.

We find that the strong\nfield regions (say with B > 2B_rms) contribute only of order 15%-20% to the RM.\nThus rare structures do not dominate the RM; rather the general 'sea' of volume\nfilling fluctuating fields are the dominant contributors. We also show that the\nmagnetic integral scale, L_{int}, which is directly related to the RM\ndispersion, increases in all the runs, as Lorentz forces become important to\nsaturate the dynamo. It appears that due to the ordering effect of the Lorentz\nforces, L_{int} of the saturated field tends to a modest fraction, 1/2-1/3 of\nthe integral scale of the velocity field, for all our runs.

To illustrate the emergence of parity\nviolation in the superfluid, we analyze first the excitation spectrum in the\nnormal state and show that the generalized helicity bands do not have inversion\nsymmetry in momentum space when crossed Zeeman fields are present. This is also\nreflected in the superfluid phase, where the order parameter tensor in the\ngeneralized helicity basis violates parity. However, the pairing fields in\nsinglet and triplet channels of the generalized helicity basis are still parity\neven and odd, respectively. Parity violation is further reflected on ground\nstate properties such as the spin-resolved momentum distribution, and in\nexcitation properties such as the spin-dependent spectral function and density\nof states.\n"]}]

Only in a second time they are extended to\nlabelled transition systems. By doing this, the size of the alphabet appears in\ngeneral as a multiplicative factor to both time and space complexities. Let $Q$\ndenotes the state space, $\\rightarrow$ the transition relation, $\\Sigma$ the\nalphabet and $P_{sim}$ the partition of $Q$ induced by the coarsest simulation\nequivalence. In this paper, we propose a base algorithm which minimizes, since\nthe first stages of its design, the incidence of the size of the alphabet in\nboth time and space complexities. This base algorithm, inspired by the one of\nPaige and Tarjan in 1987 for bisimulation and the one of Ranzato and Tapparo in\n2010 for simulation, is then derived in three versions. One of them has the\nbest bit space complexity up to now,\n$O(|P_{sim}|^2+|{\\rightarrow}|.\\log|{\\rightarrow}|)$, while another one has the\nbest time complexity up to now, $O(|P_{sim}|.|{\\rightarrow}|)$. Note the\nabsence of the alphabet in these complexities.

The inhomogeneous term can impose an initial condition\nor, for scattering, the preferred permitted asymptotic behavior. For bound\nstates it provides sufficient focus to exclude all but one of the homogeneous\nversion's solutions. Because of their unique solutions, such inhomogeneous\nversions of Schroedinger equations have long been the indispensable basis for a\nsolution scheme of successive perturbational corrections which are anchored by\ntheir inhomogeneous term. Here it is noted that every such perturbational\nsolution scheme for an inhomogeneous linear vector equation spins off a\nnonperturbational continued-fraction scheme. Unlike its\nrepresentation-independent antecedent, the spin-off scheme only works in\nrepresentations where all components of the equation's inhomogeneous term are\nnonzero. But that requirement seems to confer theoretical physics robustness\nheretofore unknown: for quantum fields the order of the perturbation places a\nbound on unperturbed particle number, the spin-off scheme contrariwise has only\nbasis elements of unbounded unperturbed particle number. It furthermore is\ndifficult to visualize such a continued-fraction spin-off scheme generating\ninfinities, since its successive iterations always go into denominators.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

The distance between the two\ndistributions is measured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a\nStochastic EM-type algorithm, driven by the RJ-MCMC sampler, is proposed to\nestimate the parameters. Two signal decomposition problems are considered, to\nshow the capability of VAPoRS both for relabeling and for summarizing variable\ndimensional posterior distributions: the classical problem of detecting and\nestimating sinusoids in white Gaussian noise on the one hand, and a particle\ncounting problem motivated by the Pierre Auger project in astrophysics on the\nother hand.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1111.6298"]}]
