To simulate microlensing, we first built a simplified image of\nthe quasar composed of an accretion disc, and of a larger ring-like torus.

By resolving the null geodesic equation, we obtain\nthe modified luminosity distance, which has a dipolar form at the leading\norder. Thus, the \"wind\" describes well the bulk flow. In addition, we perform a\nleast-(\\chi^2) fit to the data of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the Union2.1\ncompilation. The peculiar velocity of the bulk flow has an upper limit\n(v_{bulk}\\lesssim 4000 \\rm{km/s}), which is compatible with all the existing\nobservational values.\n","Comment: 11 pages, no figure.

This has lead to suggestions that the shape\nof the IMF is directly inherited from the shape of the CMF - and therefore, by\nimplication, that there is a self-similar mapping from the CMF onto the IMF. If\nwe assume a self-similar mapping, it follows (i) that F = N0/eta, where eta is\nthe mean fraction of a core's mass that ends up in stars, and N0 is the mean\nnumber of stars spawned by a single core; and (ii) that the stars spawned by a\nsingle core must have an approximately log-normal distribution of relative\nmasses, with universal standard deviation sigma0. Observations can be expected\nto deliver ever more accurate estimates of F, but this still leaves a\ndegeneracy between eta and N0; and sigma0 is also unconstrained by observation.\nHere we show that these parameters can be estimated by invoking binary\nstatistics. Specifically, if (a) each core spawns one long-lived binary system,\nand (b) the probability that a star of mass M is part of this long-lived binary\nis proportional to M^alpha, current observations of the binary frequency as a\nfunction of primary mass and the distribution of mass ratios strongly favour\neta = 1.0 +/- 0.3, N0 = 4.3 +/- 0.4, sigma0 = 0.3 +/- 0.03 and alpha = 0.9 +/-\n0.6. The mapping from CMF to IMF is not necessarily self-similar - there are\nmany possible motivations for a non self-similar mapping - but if it is not,\nthen the shape of the IMF cannot be inherited from the CMF. Given the limited\nobservational constraints currently available and the ability of a self-similar\nmapping to satisfy them, the possibility that the shape of the IMF is inherited\nfrom the CMF cannot be ruled out at this juncture.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures"]}]

It\nis now commonly accepted that the most promising approach is the Decoherence\nTheory, based on the system-environment paradigm. To explain the observed\nredundancy and objectivity of information in the classical realm, Zurek\nproposed to divide the environment into independent fractions and argued that\neach of them carries a nearly complete classical information about the system.\nThis Quantum Darwinism model has nevertheless some serious drawbacks: i) the\nentropic information redundancy is motivated by a priori purely classical\nreasoning; ii) there is no answer to the basic question: what physical process\nmakes the transition from quantum description to classical objectivity\npossible? Here we prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for\nobjective existence of a state is the spectrum broadcasting process, which, in\nparticular, implies Quantum Darwinism. We first show it in general, using\nmultiple environments paradigm, a suitable definition of objectivity, and\nBohr's notion of non-disturbance, and then on the emblematic example for\nDecoherence Theory: a dielectric sphere illuminated by photons.

The covariant\ndecomposition of these currents provides the electromagnetic and weak\n(transition) form factors. The formalism is first applied to the study of\nheavy-light systems. Problems with cluster separability, which are inherent in\nthe Bakamjian-Thomas construction, are discussed and it is shown how to keep\nthem under control.

In order to reap the enormous gain of massive MIMO and yet reduce\nits cost to an affordable level, this paper proposes a novel system design by\nintegrating an electromagnetic (EM) lens with the large antenna array, termed\n\\emph{electromagnetic lens antenna} (ELA). An ELA has the capability of\nfocusing the power of any incident plane wave passing through the EM lens to a\nsmall subset of the antenna array, while the location of focal area is\ndependent on the angle of arrival (AoA) of the wave. As compared to\nconventional antenna arrays without the EM lens, the proposed system can\nsubstantially reduce the number of required radio frequency (RF) chains at the\nreceiver and hence, the implementation costs.

It is commonly admitted\nthat, when proteins fold from their primary linear structures to their final 3D\nconformations, they tend to choose the ones that minimize their free energy. To\nfind the 3D conformation of a protein knowing its amino acid sequence,\nbioinformaticians use various models of different resolutions and artificial\nintelligence tools, as the protein folding prediction problem is a NP complete\none. More precisely, to determine the backbone structure of the protein using\nthe low resolution models (2D HP square and 3D HP cubic), by finding the\nconformation that minimize free energy, is intractable exactly. Both the proof\nof NP-completeness and the 2D prediction consider that acceptable conformations\nhave to satisfy a self-avoiding walk (SAW) requirement, as two different amino\nacids cannot occupy a same position in the lattice. It is shown in this\ndocument that the SAW requirement considered when proving NP-completeness is\ndifferent from the SAW requirement used in various prediction programs, and\nthat they are different from the real biological requirement.
