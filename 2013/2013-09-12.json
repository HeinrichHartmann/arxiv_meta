This is applied to study the impact the choice of prior\ndensity has in two market scenarios. In the first scenario, call option prices\nare prescribed at only a small number of strikes, and we see that the choice of\nprior, or indeed its omission, yields notably different densities. The second\nscenario is given by CBOE option price data for S&P500 index options at a large\nnumber of strikes.

We find that the\nresulting digital option prices are essentially the same as those given by the\n(non-relative) Buchen-Kelly density itself. In other words, in a sufficiently\nliquid market the influence of the prior density seems to vanish almost\ncompletely.

The presence of disorder leads to Anderson localization, while\nboth interaction and noise tend to suppress localization and restore transport,\nalthough with completely different mechanisms. When only noise or interaction\nare present we observe a diffusion dynamics that can be explained by existing\nmicroscopic models. When noise and interaction are combined, we observe instead\na complex anomalous diffusion. By combining experimental measurements with\nnumerical simulations, we show that such anomalous behavior can be modeled with\na generalized diffusion equation, in which the noise- and interaction-induced\ndiffusions enter in an additive manner.

We constructed a sample of Fermi GRBs with homogeneous\nselection criteria, and we studied their distribution in the Epi-Eiso plane.\nOur sample is made of 43 GRBs with a redshift and 243 GRBs without a redshift.\nWe show that GRBs with a redshift follow a broad Epi-Eiso relation, while GRBs\nwithout a redshift show several outliers. We use these samples to discuss the\nimpact of selection effects associated with GRB detection and with redshift\nmeasurement. We find that the Epi-Eiso relation is partly due to intrinsic GRB\nproperties and partly due to selection effects. The lower right boundary of the\nEpi-Eiso relation stems from a true lack of luminous GRBs with low Epi. In\ncontrast, the upper left boundary is attributed to selection effects acting\nagainst the detection GRBs with low Eiso and large Epi that appear to have a\nlower signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that GRBs with and\nwithout a redshift follow different distributions in the Epi-Eiso plane. GRBs\nwith a redshift are concentrated near the lower right boundary of the Epi-Eiso\nrelation. This suggests that it is easier to measure the redshift of GRBs close\nto the lower Epi-Eiso boundary.

It is noted that\nphysical systems being appropriately described by the TB model can exhibit the\nmain strongly correlated electron system (SCES) properties, when they are\nsolved in the HF approximation, by also allowing crystal symmetry breaking\neffects and non-collinear spin orientations of the HF orbitals. It is argued\nhow a simple 2D square lattice system of Coulomb interacting electrons can\nexhibit insulator gaps and pseudogap states, and quantum phase transitions as\nillustrated by the mentioned former works. A discussion is also presented here\nindicating the possibility of attaining room temperature superconductivity, by\nmeans of a surface coating with water molecules of cleaved planes of graphite,\nbeing orthogonal to its c-axis. The possibility that 2D arrays of quantum dots\ncan give rise to the same effect is also proposed to consideration.

This pivotal date is considered crucial to the various\ncalculations of the early chronology of the ancient Near East. According to the\nVenus Tablet (Enuma Anu Enlil 63) which describes the rising and setting of\nVenus during the reign of Ammisaduqa, there are only 4 possibilities implying 4\ndates for the destruction of Ur (1912, 1944, 2004, 2064 BCE) but a tablet of\nastronomical omens (Enuma Anu Enlil 20,21) mentions a lunar eclipse, dated\n14/III/48, at the end of the reign of Shulgi and a lunar eclipse, dated\n14/XII/24, at the end of the reign of Ibbi-Sin. Over the period 2200-1850 BCE\nthere are only 3 pairs of eclipses, spaced by 42 years, matching the\ndescription of astronomical omens but only 1 agreeing with the previous 4\ndates. The second way to check the date for the fall of Babylon is to rebuild\nthe chronology of this period thanks to synchronisms dated by astronomy from\nAssyrian, Babylonian, Egyptian and Israelite chronologies which provide\nsynchronisms that can be dated independently. The Mesopotamian chronology of\nthis period is reconstructed using the number of Assyrian eponyms (1 a year)\nand the length of Babylonian reigns combined with the set of synchronisms among\nAssyrian and Babylonian kings in Annals. During the reign of Assur-dan I\n(1179-1133) eponyms began on 1 Nisan instead of 1 Sippu, but Assyrian lunar\nyears without intercalation remained the norm until Tiglath-pileser I. As the\nBabylonian year began on 1st Nisan (just after the spring equinox), Assyrian\nyears coincided with Babylonian lunar years with intercalation, thus the period\nbetween Assur-dan I and Tiglath-pileser I was therefore transitional. Owing to\nthe Babylonian chronology and synchronisms it is possible to date other\nchronologies.\n","Comment: 76 pages, quoted at The University of Edinburgh Oct 16, 2011\n  http://www.academia.edu/2402713"]}]

On the basis of a method that employs\nexact solutions to relativistic wave equations for charged particles, analytic\nexpressions for the partial decay widths of Z-boson are obtained at an\narbitrary value the external-field strength. The total Z-boson decay width in\nan intense electromagnetic field, is calculated by summing these results over\nall known generations of charged leptons and quarks. It is found that, in the\nregion of relatively weak fields, the field-induced corrections to the standard\nZ-boson decay width in a vacuum do not exceed 2%. As the external-field\nstrength increases, the total decay width develops oscillations against the\nbackground of its gradual decrease to the absolute-minimum point. In the region\nof strong fields the total decay width of Z-boson grows monotonically.

In this paper in order to solve this problem, we\npropose to consider a complex version of the higher order derivative theory and\nmap this theory to a real first order theory. To achieve this relationship, the\nhigher order derivative formulation must be complex since there is not a real\ncanonical transformation from this theory to a real first order theory with\nstable interactions. In this manner, we work with a non-Hermitian higher order\ntime derivative theory. To quantize this complex theory, we introduce reality\nconditions that allow us to map the complex higher order theory to a real one,\nand we show that the resulting theory is regularizable and renormalizable for a\nclass of interactions.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures"]}]
