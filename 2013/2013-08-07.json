Our\nmagnetic susceptibility chi(T) data fit well with the Curie-Weiss formula in\nthe temperature range of 80-300K and it yields a Curie constant\nC=0.39cm3K/mole-V4+ and an antiferromagnetic Weiss temperature theta=-26K. The\nchi(T) curve shows a broad maximum at T~25K indicative of short-range order\n(SRO) and an anomaly corresponding to long-range order (LRO) at TN~6K. The\nvalue of the frustration index (f=mod[theta/TN]~5) suggests that the system is\nmoderately frustrated. Above the LRO temperature the experimental magnetic\nsusceptibility data match well with the coupled Majumdar-Ghosh chain model with\nthe ratio of the nnn (next-nearest neighbor) to nn (nearest neighbor) magnetic\ncoupling alpha=2 and Jnnn/kB=40K. In a mean-field approach when considering the\ninter-chain interactions, we obtain the total inter-chain coupling to be about\n16K. The LRO anomaly at TN is also observe in the specific heat Cp(T) data and\nis not sensitive to an applied magnetic field up to 90kOe. A 51V NMR signal\ncorresponding to the non-magnetic vanadium was observed. Anomalies at 6K were\nobserved in the variation with temperature of the 51V NMR linewidth and in the\nspin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1, indicating that they are sensitive to the\nLRO onset and fluctuations at the magnetic V sites. The existence of two\ncomponents (one short and another long) is observed in the spin-spin relaxation\nrate 1/T2 data in the vicinity of TN. The shorter component seems to be\nintimately connected with the magnetically ordered state.

The idea\nis to partition the pixels of a hyperspectral image into a number of spatial\nneighborhoods called contextual groups and to model each pixel with a linear\ncombination of a few dictionary elements learned from the data. Since pixels\ninside a contextual group are often made up of the same materials, their linear\ncombinations are constrained to use common elements from the dictionary. To\nthis end, dictionary learning is carried out with a joint sparse regularizer to\ninduce a common sparsity pattern in the sparse coefficients of each contextual\ngroup. The sparse coefficients are then used for classification using a linear\nSVM. Experimental results on a number of real hyperspectral images confirm the\neffectiveness of the proposed representation for hyperspectral image\nclassification. Moreover, experiments with simulated multispectral data show\nthat the proposed model is capable of finding representations that may\neffectively be used for classification of multispectral-resolution samples.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures"]}]

We adopt the Bayesian inference formulation: given observational data\nand their uncertainty, the governing forward problem and its uncertainty, and a\nprior probability distribution describing uncertainty in the parameter field,\nfind the posterior probability distribution over the parameter field. The prior\nmust be chosen appropriately in order to guarantee well-posedness of the\ninfinite-dimensional inverse problem and facilitate computation of the\nposterior. Furthermore, straightforward discretizations may not lead to\nconvergent approximations of the infinite-dimensional problem. And finally,\nsolution of the discretized inverse problem via explicit construction of the\ncovariance matrix is prohibitive due to the need to solve the forward problem\nas many times as there are parameters. Our computational framework builds on\nthe infinite-dimensional formulation proposed by Stuart (A. M. Stuart, Inverse\nproblems: A Bayesian perspective, Acta Numerica, 19 (2010), pp. 451-559), and\nincorporates a number of components aimed at ensuring a convergent\ndiscretization of the underlying infinite-dimensional inverse problem. The\nframework additionally incorporates algorithms for manipulating the prior,\nconstructing a low rank approximation of the data-informed component of the\nposterior covariance operator, and exploring the posterior that together ensure\nscalability of the entire framework to very high parameter dimensions. We\ndemonstrate this computational framework on the Bayesian solution of an inverse\nproblem in 3D global seismic wave propagation with hundreds of thousands of\nparameters.\n","Comment: 30 pages; to appear in SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing"]}]

After acceleration\nby strong supernova remnant shock waves, cosmic rays undergo diffusive\npropagation through the Galaxy. During the propagation, cosmic rays may again\nencounter expanding supernova remnant shock waves, and get re-accelerated. As\nthe probability of encountering old supernova remnants is expected to be larger\nthan the young ones due to their bigger size, re-acceleration is expected to be\nproduced mainly by weaker shocks. Since weaker shocks generate a softer\nparticle spectrum, the resulting re-accelerated component will have a spectrum\nsteeper than the initial cosmic-ray source spectrum produced by strong shocks.\nFor a reasonable set of model parameters, it is shown that such re-accelerated\ncomponent can dominate the GeV energy region while the non-reaccelerated\ncomponent dominates at higher energies, explaining the observed GeV-TeV\nspectral anomaly.\n","Comment: 4 pages, Talk presented at the International Cosmic Ray Conference,\n  Rio De Janeiro, 2013"]}]

A\nnovel DoF upper bound is derived by providing users with carefully designed\ngenie information. Achievable DoF is identified using signal space alignment\nand multiple-access transmission. For the two-cluster MIMO multi-way relay\nchannel with two users in each cluster, DoF is established for the general case\nwhen users and the relay have arbitrary number of antennas, and it is shown\nthat the DoF upper bound can be achieved using signal space alignment or\nmultiple-access transmission, or a combination of both. The result is then\ngeneralized to the three user case. For the L-cluster K-user MIMO multi-way\nrelay channel in the symmetric setting, conditions under which the DoF upper\nbound can be achieved are established. In addition to being shown to be tight\nin a variety of scenarios of interests of the multi-way relay channel, the\nnewly derived upperbound also establishes the optimality of several previously\nestablished achievable DoF results for multiuser relay channels that are\nspecial cases of the multi-way relay channel.\n","Comment: submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

Calculations\nwith a plane-wave basis demonstrate that for the in-plane optical modes, the\ngeneralized-gradient approximation (GGA) yields frequencies lower by 2% than\nthe local-density approximation (LDA) and is thus in better agreement with\nexperiment. The long-range character of the dynamical matrix limits the\nvalidity of force-constant approaches that take only interaction with few\nneighboring atoms into account.
