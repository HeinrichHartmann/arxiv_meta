The most popular method for nonequilibrium systems, forward flux\nsampling (FFS), samples rare events by using interfaces to partition the whole\ntransition process into sequence of steps along an order parameter connecting\nthe initial and final states. FFS usually suffers from two main difficulties:\nlow computational efficiency due to bad interface locations and even being not\napplicable when trapping into unknown intermediate metastable states. In the\npresent work, we propose an approach to overcome these difficulties, by\nself-adaptively locating the interfaces on the fly in an optimized manner.\nContrary to the conventional FFS which set the interfaces with euqal distance\nof the order parameter, our approach determines the interfaces with equal\ntransition probability which is shown to satisfy the optimization condition.\nThis is done by firstly running long local trajectories starting from the\ncurrent interface $\\l_i$ to get the conditional probability distribution $P_c$,\nand then determining $\\l_{i+1}$ by equalling $P_c$ to a give value $p_0$. With\nthese optimized interfaces, FFS can be run in a much efficient way. In\naddition, our approach can conveniently find the intermediate metastable states\nby monitoring some special long trajectories that nither end at the initial\nstate nor reach the next interface, the number of which will increase sharply\nfrom zero if such metastable states are encountered. We apply our approach to a\nmodel two-state system and a two-dimensional lattice gas Ising model. Our\napproach is shown to be much more efficient than the conventional FFS method\nwithout losing accuracy, and it can also well reproduce the two-step nucleation\nscenario of the Ising model with easy identification of the intermidiate\nmetastable state.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We propose a simple way of estimating not only the parameter in the\nstatistical model but also the contamination ratio of outliers. Estimating the\ncontamination ratio is important, since one can detect outliers out of the\ntraining samples based on the estimated contamination ratio. For this purpose,\nwe use scoring rules with an extended statistical models, that is called the\nenlarged models. Also, the regression problems are considered. We study a\ncomplex heterogeneous contamination, in which the contamination ratio of\noutliers in the dependent variable may depend on the independent variable. We\npropose a simple method to obtain a robust regression estimator under\nheterogeneous contamination. In addition, we show that our method provides also\nan estimator of the expected contamination ratio that is available to detect\nthe outliers out of training samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods compared to the conventional estimators.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables"]}]

The use\nof SVMs in estimation problems has been traditionally limited to its mere use\nas a black-box model. Noting such limitations in the literature, we take\nadvantage of several properties of Mercer's kernels and functional analysis to\ndevelop a family of SVM methods for estimation in DSP. Three types of signal\nmodel equations are analyzed. First, when a specific time-signal structure is\nassumed to model the underlying system that generated the data, the linear\nsignal model (so called Primal Signal Model formulation) is first stated and\nanalyzed. Then, non-linear versions of the signal structure can be readily\ndeveloped by following two different approaches. On the one hand, the signal\nmodel equation is written in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) using the\nwell-known RKHS Signal Model formulation, and Mercer's kernels are readily used\nin SVM non-linear algorithms. On the other hand, in the alternative and not so\ncommon Dual Signal Model formulation, a signal expansion is made by using an\nauxiliary signal model equation given by a non-linear regression of each time\ninstant in the observed time series. These building blocks can be used to\ngenerate different novel SVM-based methods for problems of signal estimation,\nand we deal with several of the most important ones in DSP. We illustrate the\nusefulness of this methodology by defining SVM algorithms for linear and\nnon-linear system identification, spectral analysis, nonuniform interpolation,\nsparse deconvolution, and array processing. The performance of the developed\nSVM methods is compared to standard approaches in all these settings.

Nanostructuration requires the presence of a bock that\nremains miscible in the polymer during polymerization. The selection of the\nmiscible block depends on the particular system and in some cases (e.g., for\nepoxy-amine network based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A, and 4,4'-\ndiaminodiphenylsulfone) it is very difficult to find such a block. In this\nmanuscript it is shown that random copolymers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and\nN,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA) containing different molar fractions of DMA, can\nbe used as a miscible block for the nanostructuration of epoxies. The\nmiscibility of the random copolymer during formation of the epoxy network was\nfirst analyzed determining cloud-point conversions as a function of the molar\nfraction of DMA in the copolymer. A thermodynamic model of the phase separation\nwas performed using the Flory-Huggins model and taking the polydispersities of\nboth polymers into account. A single expression of the interaction parameter\nbased on the theory of random copolymers provided a reasonable fitting of the\nexperimental cloud-point curves. The significant increase in the miscibility\nproduced by using small DMA molar fractions in the copolymer was explained by\nthe high negative value of the binary interaction energy between DMA and the\nepoxy-amine solvent, associated to the positive value of the interaction energy\nbetween DMA and MMA units. Block copolymers with poly(n-butyl acrylate) as the\nimmiscible block and the random copolymer P(MMA-co-DMA) as the miscible block\nwere used for the nanostructuration of epoxy networks. The necessary molar\nfraction of DMA in the miscible block to stabilize a dispersion of nanosize\ndomains depended on the fraction of the immiscible block.\n","Comment: Author's version of a published article, available at Macromolecules\n  (ACS), http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma062185l"]}]

The model takes into account the swelling\nof the organic coronas and the dispersion of particles with swollen coronas in\nthe solvent. The energetic interaction between alkyl chains and solvent is\nconsidered, both within the corona and between the outer alkyl segments and\nfree solvent. Swelling involves mixing of alkanethiol chains and solvent in the\ncorona and stretching of the organic chains. Dispersion considers an entropic\ncontribution based on Carnahan Starling equation of state and an enthalpic term\ncalculated considering the surface contacts between alkyl segments placed in\nthe external boundary of the corona and the molecules of free solvent. Two\ndifferent kinds of phase equilibrium are found. One of them, observed at high\nvalues of the interaction parameter, is the typical liquid-liquid equilibrium\nfor compact NPs in a poor solvent where a complete phase separation is observed\nwhen cooling (increasing the interaction parameter). The second liquid-liquid\nequilibrium is observed at low values of the interaction parameter, where\nswelling of coronas is favored. In this region two different phases co-exist,\none more concentrated in NPs that exhibit relatively compact coronas and the\nother one more diluted in NPs with extended coronas. In diluted solutions of\nNPs the deswelling of the fully extended coronas takes place abruptly in a very\nsmall temperature range, leading to a solution of compact NPs.

These rhythms allow living organisms to\nanticipate the daily alternation of light and darkness. Experiments carried out\nin cyanobacteria have shown the adaptive value of circadian clocks. In these\nexperiments a wild type cyanobacterial strain (with a 24 h circadian rhythm)\nand a mutant strain (with a longer or shorter period) grow in competition.

As a\nconsequence the initial population of one strain grows while the other decays.\n  These experiments were made under fixed light and dark intervals.
