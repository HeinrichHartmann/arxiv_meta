Even though kMC methods are accurate, they are\ncomputationally expensive for large-scale systems. Hence approximation\nalgorithms are necessary for simulating experimentally observed properties and\nmorphologies. One such approximation method stems from the coarse graining of\nthe lattice which leads to coarse-grained Monte Carlo (GCMC) methods while\nLangevin approximations can further accelerate the simulations. Moreover,\nsacrificing fine scale (i.e. microscopic) accuracy, mesoscopic deterministic or\nstochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are efficiently applied for\nsimulating surface processes. In this paper, we are interested in simulating\nsurface diffusion for pattern formation applications which is achieved by\nsuitably discretizing the mesoscopic SPDE in space. The proposed discretization\nschemes which are actually Langevin-type approximation models are strongly\nconnected with the properties of the underlying interacting particle system.

Immediately after the flare, the twist index of regions around\nthe footpoints greatly diminish and the above field lines become low lying and\nless twisted (~0.6 turns), overarched by loops linking the later formed two\nflare ribbons. About 10% of the flux (~3x10^19 Mx) from the inner footpoints\nhas undergone a footpoint exchange.

It is\nfeared that gas at larger scales might still retain enough angular momentum and\nsettle into a larger scale disc with very low or no inflow to form or replenish\nthe inner accretion disc (on ~0.01 pc scales). In this paper we report on\nhydrodynamical simulations of rotating infalling gas shells impacting at\ndifferent angles onto a pre-existing, primitive large scale (~10 pc) disc\naround a super-massive black hole. The aim is to explore how the interaction\nbetween the shell and the disc redistributes the angular momentum on scales\nclose to the black hole's sphere of influence. Angular momentum redistribution\nvia hydrodynamical shocks leads to inflows of gas across the inner boundary,\nenhancing the inflow rate by more than 2-3 orders of magnitude. In all cases,\nthe gas inflow rate across the inner parsec is higher than in the absence of\nthe interaction, and the orientation of the angular momentum of the flow in the\nregion changes with time due to gas mixing. Warped discs or nested misaligned\nrings form depending on the angular momentum content of the infalling shell\nrelative to the disc. In the cases in which the shell falls in near\ncounter-rotation, part of the resulting flows settle into an inner dense disc\nwhich becomes more susceptible to mass transfer.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 20 figures.

However, least-squares approximations tend to be noisy in\nhigh-dimensional settings, and may not be appropriate for arrays that include\ndiscrete or ordinal measurements. This article develops methodology to obtain\nlow-rank model-based representations of continuous, discrete and ordinal data\narrays. The model is based on a parameterization of the mean array as a\nmultilinear product of a reduced-rank core array and a set of index-specific\northogonal eigenvector matrices. It is shown how orthogonally equivariant\nparameter estimates can be obtained from Bayesian procedures under invariant\nprior distributions. Additionally, priors on the core array are developed that\nact as regularizers, leading to improved inference over the standard\nleast-squares estimator, and providing robustness to misspecification of the\narray rank. This model-based approach is extended to accommodate discrete or\nordinal data arrays using a semiparametric transformation model. The resulting\nlow-rank representation is scale-free, in the sense that it is invariant to\nmonotonic transformations of the data array. In an example analysis of a\nmultivariate discrete network dataset, this scale-free approach provides a more\ncomplete description of data patterns.\n"]}]

The advantage compared to the existing\nIETF STUN (RFC 5389), TURN (RFC 5766) and ICE (RFC 5245) protocols is that it\ndoes not require a public host and port mapping for each participating local\nhost, and it works with more restrictive firewall policies. WebRTC implements\nICE which combines STUN and TURN probes to automatically find the best\nconnection between two peers who want to communicate. In corporate networks,\nsimple hole punching and NAT traversal techniques typically do not work, e.g.\nbecause of symmetric NATs. Dynamic allocation of ports on an external 3rd party\nrelay service is also typically blocked on restricted hosts. In our use case,\ndoctors at hospitals can only access port 80 through the hospital firewall on\nexternal machines, and they need to communicate with patients who are typically\nbehind a NAT in a local WiFi network. VPN solutions only work for staff but not\nbetween patients and staff. Our solution solves this problem by redirecting all\nWebRTC traffic through a gateway service on the local network that has a secure\ntunnel established with a public gateway. The public gateway redirects traffic\nfrom multiple concurrent streams securely between local gateway services that\nconnect to it. The local gateways also communicate with browsers on their local\nnetwork to mimic a direct browser-to-browser connection without having to\nchange the browser runtime. We have demonstrated that this technique works well\nwithin the hospital network and arbitrary patient networks, without the need\nfor any individual host configuration.

The evolution of any\nbroadly applied model is accompanied by multiple generalizations that aim to\nresolve conceptual difficulties and to explain the ever-growing pool of\nobservational data. In the case of Standard Cosmological Model one of the most\npromising directions of generalization is replacement of the cosmological\nconstant with a more complicated, dynamic, form of dark energy and\nincorporation of interaction between the dark components---dark energy (DE) and\ndark matter (DM). Typically, DE models are based on scalar fields minimally\ncoupled to gravity, and do not implement explicit coupling of the field to the\nbackground DM. However, there is no fundamental reason for this assumption in\nthe absence of an underlying symmetry which would suppress the coupling. Given\nthat we do not know the true nature of either DE or DM, we cannot exclude the\npossibility that there is some kind of coupling between them. Whereas\ninteractions between DE and normal matter particles are heavily constrained by\nobservations (e.g. in the solar system and gravitational experiments on Earth),\nthis is not the case for DM particles. In other words, it is possible for the\ndark components to interact with each other while not being coupled to standard\nmodel particles.

For example, for marketing purposes a\ncompany consider profiling a new user based on her observed web browsing\nbehavior, referral keywords or other relevant information. In many real world\napplications the values of some attributes are not only observable, but can be\nactively decided by a decision maker.

Yet, these\npurely topological metrics fail to capture the real behaviour of power grids.\nThis paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, as a\nvulnerability measure to de- termine the critical components in a power grid.\nDifferently than the existing purely topological measures, the effective graph\nresistance accounts for the electrical properties of power grids such as power\nflow allocation according to Kirchoff laws. To demonstrate the applicability of\nthe effective graph resistance, a quantitative vulnerability assessment of the\nIEEE 118 buses power system is performed. The simulation results verify the\neffectiveness of the effective graph resistance to identify the critical\ntransmission lines in a power grid.\n"]}]

This problem has been discussed previously in Efron and\nTibshirani [Ann. Statist. 26 (1998) 1687-1718], and a corrected p-value with\nsecond-order asymptotic accuracy is calculated by the two-level bootstrap of\nEfron, Halloran and Holmes [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 93 (1996)\n13429-13434] based on the ABC bias correction of Efron [J. Amer. Statist.\nAssoc. 82 (1987) 171-185]. Our argument is an extension of their asymptotic\ntheory, where the geometry, such as the signed distance and the curvature of\nthe boundary, plays an important role. We give another calculation of the\ncorrected p-value without finding the ``nearest point'' on the boundary to the\nobservation, which is required in the two-level bootstrap and is an\nimplementational burden in complicated problems. The key idea is to alter the\nsample size of the replicated dataset from that of the observed dataset. The\nfrequency of the replicates falling in the region is counted for several sample\nsizes, and then the p-value is calculated by looking at the change in the\nfrequencies along the changing sample sizes. This is the multiscale bootstrap\nof Shimodaira [Systematic Biology 51 (2002) 492-508], which is third-order\naccurate for the multivariate normal model. Here we introduce a newly devised\nmultistep-multiscale bootstrap, calculating a third-order accurate p-value for\nthe exponential family of distributions.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/009053604000000823 in the\n  Annals of Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]
