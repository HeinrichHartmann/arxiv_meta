Their\nmain aim was to describe the statistics of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence\nin spectral space, using a simple set of ordinary differential equations. In\nthe eighties, shell models of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence emerged\nbased on the same principles as their hydrodynamic counter-part but also\nincorporating interactions between magnetic and velocity fields. In recent\nyears, significant improvements have been made such as the inclusion of\nnon-local interactions and appropriate definitions for helicities. Though shell\nmodels cannot account for the spatial complexity of MHD turbulence, their\ndynamics are not over simplified and do reflect those of real MHD turbulence\nincluding intermittency or chaotic reversals of large-scale modes. Furthermore,\nthese models use realistic values for dimensionless parameters (high kinetic\nand magnetic Reynolds numbers, low or high magnetic Prandtl number) allowing\nextended inertial range and accurate dissipation rate. Using modern computers\nit is difficult to attain an inertial range of three decades with direct\nnumerical simulations, whereas eight are possible using shell models. In this\nreview we set up a general mathematical framework allowing the description of\nany MHD shell model. The variety of the latter, with their advantages and\nweaknesses, is introduced.

Here we propose that entanglement, a common\nconcept in quantum information theory, may serve as a telltale of the\ndifficulty of counting exactly or approximately. We quantify entanglement by\nusing Renyi entropies S(q), which we define by bipartitioning the logic\nvariables of a generic satisfiability problem. We conjecture that\nS(q\\rightarrow 0) provides information about the difficulty of counting\nsolutions exactly, while S(q>0) indicates the possibility of doing an efficient\napproximate counting. We test this conjecture by employing a matrix computing\nscheme to numerically solve #2SAT problems for a large number of uniformly\ndistributed instances. We find that all Renyi entropies scale linearly with the\nnumber of variables in the case of the #2SAT problem; this is consistent with\nthe fact that neither exact nor approximate efficient algorithms are known for\nthis problem. However, for the negated (disjunctive) form of the problem,\nS(q\\rightarrow 0) scales linearly while S(q>0) tends to zero when the number of\nvariables is large.

First, we\ndescribe a new perspective on the structure theory of Hall algebras. This view\nsolves, in a unique way, the classic problem of the multiplication and\ncomultiplication not being compatible. Our solution is to switch to a different\nunderlying category $\\Vect^K$ of vector spaces graded by a group $K$ called the\nGrothendieck group. We equip this category with a nontrivial braiding which\ndepends on the $K$-grading. With this braiding and a given antipode, we find\nthat the Hall algebra does become a Hopf algebra object in $\\Vect^K$. Second,\nwe will describe a categorification process, call `groupoidification', which\nreplaces vector spaces with groupoids and linear operators with `spans' of\ngroupoids. We will use this process to construct a braided monoidal bicategory\nwhich categorifies $\\Vect^K$ via the groupoidification program. Specifically,\ngraded vector spaces will be replaced with groupoids `over' a fixed groupoid\nrelated to the Grothendieck group $K$. The braiding structure will come from an\ninteresting groupoid $\\EXT(M,N)$ which will behave like the Euler\ncharacteristic for the Grothendieck group $K$. We will finish with a\ndescription of our plan to, in future work, apply the same concept to the\nstructure maps of the Hall algebra, which will eventually give us a Hopf\n2-algebra object in our braided monoidal bicategory.\n"]}]

It was observed previously that contracting edges that satisfy the so\ncalled link condition preserves homeomorphism in low dimensional complexes, and\nhomotopy in general. But, checking the link condition involves computation in\nall dimensions, and hence can be costly, especially in high dimensional\ncomplexes. We define a weaker and more local condition called the p-link\ncondition for each dimension p, and study its effect on edge contractions. We\nprove the following: (i) For homology groups, edges satisfying the p- and\n(p-1)-link conditions can be contracted without disturbing the p-dimensional\nhomology group. (ii) For relative homology groups, the (p-1)-, and the\n(p-2)-link conditions suffice to guarantee that the contraction does not\nintroduce any new class in any of the resulting relative homology groups,\nthough some of the existing classes can be destroyed. Unfortunately, the\nsurjection in relative homolgy groups does not guarantee that no new relative\ntorsion is created. (iii) For torsions, edges satisfying the p-link condition\nalone can be contracted without creating any new relative torsion and the\np-link condition cannot be avoided. The results on relative homology and\nrelative torsion are motivated by recent results on computing optimal\nhomologous chains, which state that such problems can be solved by linear\nprogramming if the complex has no relative torsion.

Since vacua\nare in the Higgs phase, we find domain walls (kinks) and vortices as the only\nelementary solitons. Stable monopoles and instantons can exist as composite\nsolitons with vortices attached. Webs of walls are also found as another\ncomposite soliton.
