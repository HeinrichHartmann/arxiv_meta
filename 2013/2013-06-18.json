The Serengeti ecosystem provides an\nopportunity to examine structure in a newly compiled food web that includes\nspecies-level resolution among plants, allowing us to address whether groups in\nthe food web correspond to tightly-connected compartments or functional groups,\nand whether network structure reflects spatial or trophic organization, or a\ncombination of the two. We have compiled the major mammalian and plant\ncomponents of the Serengeti food web from published literature, and we infer\nits group structure using our method. We find that network structure\ncorresponds to spatially distinct plant groups coupled at higher trophic levels\nby groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus\nthe group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild\nstructure and spatial patterns, in contrast to the standard compartments\ntypically identified in ecological networks.

The answer to this question is important, since some published\nnumerical studies use the time difference quotients, whereas other numerical\nstudies do not. The criterion used in this paper to answer this question is the\nrate of convergence of the error of the reduced order model with respect to the\nnumber of proper orthogonal decomposition basis functions. Two cases are\nconsidered: the no_DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are not\nused, and the DQ case, in which the snapshot difference quotients are used. The\nerror estimates suggest that the convergence rates in the $C^0(L^2)$-norm and\nin the $C^0(H^1)$-norm are optimal for the DQ case, but suboptimal for the\nno_DQ case. The convergence rates in the $L^2(H^1)$-norm are optimal for both\nthe DQ case and the no_DQ case. Numerical tests are conducted on the heat\nequation and on the Burgers equation. The numerical results support the\nconclusions drawn from the theoretical error estimates. Overall, the\ntheoretical and numerical results strongly suggest that, in order to achieve\noptimal pointwise in time rates of convergence with respect to the number of\nproper orthogonal decomposition basis functions, one should use the snapshot\ndifference quotients.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]

Since that time we have found that the\nformer are related to \"impulsive\" SEP events from impulsive flares or jets.\nHere, resonant stochastic acceleration, related to magnetic reconnection\ninvolving open field lines, produces not only electrons but 1000-fold\nenhancements of 3He/4He and of (Z>50)/O. Alternatively, in \"gradual\" SEP\nevents, shock waves, driven out from the Sun by coronal mass ejections (CMEs),\nmore democratically sample ion abundances that are even used to measure the\ncoronal abundances of the elements. Sometimes residual impulsive suprathermal\nions contribute to the seed population for shock acceleration, complicating the\nabundance picture, but this process has now been modeled theoretically.\nInitially, impulsive events define a point source on the Sun, selectively\nfilling few magnetic flux tubes, while gradual events show broad acceleration\nthat can fill half of the inner heliosphere, beginning when the shock reaches\n~2 solar radii. Shock acceleration occurs as ions are scattered back and forth\nacross the shock by resonant Alfven waves amplified by the accelerated protons\nthemselves. These waves also can produce a streaming-limited maximum SEP\nintensity and plateau region upstream of the shock. Behind the shock lies the\nlarge expanse of the \"reservoir\", a spatially extensive trapped volume of\nuniform SEP intensities with invariant energy-spectral shapes where overall\nintensities decrease with time as the enclosing \"magnetic bottle\" expands\nadiabatically. These reservoirs now explain the slow intensity decrease that\ndefines gradual events, once erroneously attributed solely to slow outward\ndiffusion.\n","Comment: Accepted by Space Science Reviews, 48 pages"]}]

Consequently, successful\nblind deconvolution requires the estimation of a spatially-varying or\nnon-uniform blur operator. Using ideas from Bayesian inference and convex\nanalysis, this paper derives a non-uniform blind deblurring algorithm with\nseveral desirable, yet previously-unexplored attributes. The underlying\nobjective function includes a spatially adaptive penalty which couples the\nlatent sharp image, non-uniform blur operator, and noise level together. This\ncoupling allows the penalty to automatically adjust its shape based on the\nestimated degree of local blur and image structure such that regions with large\nblur or few prominent edges are discounted. Remaining regions with modest blur\nand revealing edges therefore dominate the overall estimation process without\nexplicitly incorporating structure-selection heuristics. The algorithm can be\nimplemented using a majorization-minimization strategy that is virtually\nparameter free.

Although processes considered in this paper were\ndefined either in non-commutative probability context or through quadratic\nharnesses we define them once more as so to say 'continuous time '\ngeneralization of a simple, symmetric, discrete time process satisfying simple\nconditions imposed on the form of its first two conditional moments. The finite\ndimensional distributions of the first one (say X=(X_{t})_{t\\geq0} called\nq-Wiener) depends on one parameter q\\in(-1,1] and of the second one (say\nY=(Y_{t})_{t\\inR} called ({\\alpha},q)- Ornstein--Uhlenbeck) on two parameters\n({\\alpha},q)\\in(0,\\infty)\\times(-1,1]. The first one resembles Wiener process\nin the sense that for q=1 it is Wiener process but also that for |q|<1 and\n\\foralln\\geq1: t^{n/2}H_{n}(X_{t}/\\surdt|q), where (H_{n})_{n\\geq0} are the so\ncalled q-Hermite polynomials, are martingales. It does not have however neither\nindependent increments not allows continuous sample path modification. The\nsecond one resembles Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process. For q=1 it is a classical OU\nprocess. For |q|<1 it is also stationary with correlation function equal to\nexp(-{\\alpha}|t-s|) and has many properties resembling those of its classical\nversion. We think that these process are fascinating objects to study posing\nmany interesting, open questions.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]
