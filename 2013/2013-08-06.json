Filters refer to a class of data\nassimilation algorithms designed to update the estimation of the state as data\nis acquired sequentially. For linear problems subject to Gaussian noise\nfiltering can be performed exactly using the Kalman filter. For nonlinear\nsystems it can be approximated in a systematic way by particle filters. However\nin high dimensions these particle filtering methods can break down. Hence, for\nthe large nonlinear systems arising in applications such as oceanography and\nweather forecasting, various ad hoc filters are used, based on Gaussian\napproximations. In this work, we study the accuracy and stability of these ad\nhoc filters in the context of the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The\nideas readily generalize to a range of dissipative partial differential\nequations (PDEs). By working in this infinite dimensional setting we provide an\nanalysis which is useful for the understanding of high dimensional filtering,\nand is robust to mesh-refinement. We describe theoretical results showing that,\nin the small observational noise limit, the filters can be tuned to perform\naccurately in tracking the signal itself (filter accuracy), provided the system\nis observed in a sufficiently large low dimensional space; roughly speaking\nthis space should be large enough to contain the unstable modes of the\nlinearized dynamics. The tuning corresponds to what is known as variance\ninflation in the applied literature. Numerical results are given which\nillustrate the theory.

This implies that multipartite\nstates are more fragile to decoherence for higher values of N. Surprisingly, a\nrapid sudden death of discord occurs in case of phase flip channel. However,\nfor bit flip channel, no sudden death happens for the six-qubit states. On the\nother hand, depolarizing channel heavily influences the QD and GQD as compared\nto the amplitude damping channel.

A quantum theory on protein folding is\nproposed.

Following the idea that the slow\nvariables slave the fast ones and using the nonadiabaticity operator method we\ndeduce the Hamiltonian describing conformational change. It is proved that the\ninfluence of fast variables on the macromolecule can fully be taken into\naccount through a phase transformation of slow variable wave function.

CH3OCH3 has been detected in the\nground state, and in the torsionally excited states v11=1 and v15=1, for which\nlines have been detected here for the first time. The emission is modeled with\nan isothermal source structure as well as with a non-uniform spherical\nstructure. For non-uniform source models one abundance jump for dimethyl ether\nis sufficient to fit the emission, but two components are needed for the\nisothermal models. This suggests that dimethyl ether is present in an extended\nregion of the envelope and traces a non-uniform density and temperature\nstructure. Both types of models furthermore suggest that most dimethyl ether is\npresent in gas that is warmer than 100 K, but a smaller fraction of 5%-28% is\npresent at temperatures between 70 and 100 K. The dimethyl ether present in\nthis cooler gas is likely formed in the solid state, while gas phase formation\nprobably is dominant above 100 K.

The fundamental principle underlying\ncomplex resource-allocation dynamics is Boolean interactions associated with\nminority games, as resources are generally limited and agents tend to choose\nthe least used resource based on available information. A common but harmful\ndynamical behavior in resource-allocation systems is herding, where there are\ntime intervals during which a large majority of the agents compete for a few\nresources, leaving many other resources unused. Ac- companying the herd\nbehavior is thus strong fluctuations with time in the number of resources being\nused. In this paper, we articulate and establish that an intuitive control\nstrategy, namely pinning control, is effective at harnessing the herding\ndynamics. In particular, by fixing the choices of resources for a few agents\nwhile leaving majority of the agents free, herding can be eliminated\ncompletely. Our investigation is systematic in that we consider random and\ntargeted pinning and a variety of network topologies, and we carry out a\ncomprehensive analysis in the framework of mean-field theory to understand the\nworking of control. The basic philosophy is then that, when a few agents waive\ntheir freedom to choose resources by receiving sufficient incentives, majority\nof the agents benefit in that they will make fair, efficient, and effective use\nof the available resources. Our work represents a basic and general framework\nto address the fundamental issue of fluctuations in complex dynamical systems\nwith significant applications to social, economical and political systems.\n","Comment: 9 pages,4 figures"]}]

They form in dense cores of molecular clouds that are observed to be\nsignificantly magnetized. Our previous study shows that magnetic braking can\ntighten the binary separation during the protostellar mass accretion phase by\nremoving the angular momentum of the accreting material. Recent numerical\ncalculations of single star formation have shown that misalignment between the\nmagnetic field and rotation axis may weaken both magnetic braking and the\nassociated magnetically driven outflows. These two effects allow for disk\nformation even in strongly magnetized cores. Here we investigate the effects of\nmagnetic field misalignment on the properties of protobinaries. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the misaligned magnetic field is more efficient at tightening the\nbinary orbit compared to the aligned field. The main reason is that the\nmisalignment weakens the magnetically-driven outflow, which allows more\nmaterial to accrete onto the binary. Even though the specific angular momentum\nof this inner material is higher than in the aligned case, it is insufficient\nto compensate for the additional mass. A corollary of this result is that a\nweaker field is required to achieve the same degree of inward migration when\nthe field is tilted relative to the rotation axis. Large field misalignment\nalso helps to produce rotationally-supported circumbinary disks even for\nrelatively strong magnetic fields, by weakening the magnetically-dominated\nstructure close to the binary. Our result may provide an explanation for the\ncircumbinary disks detected in recent SMA and ALMA observations.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 10 figures"]}]

In\nthe simulation, the continuous time dynamic system is converted into a\ndiscrete-time recursive system. As a result of this, the state indeed evolves\nby Markov transitions in the simulation rather than in continuous time. One\nsignificant issue involved with modeling of the system from practice to\nsimulation is that the simulation parameter, particularly e.g. the state Markov\ntransition noise, needs to match the iteration period of the filter. Otherwise,\nthe simulation performance may be far from the truth. Unfortunately, quite\ncommonly different-speed filters are evaluated and compared under the same\nsimulation model with the same state transition noise for simplicity regardless\nof their real sampling periods. Here the note primarily aims at clarifying this\nproblem and point out that it is very necessary to use a proper simulation\nnoise that matches the filter's speed for evaluation and comparison under the\nsame simulation model.\n","Comment: This is a short technical note pointing out a common unfair treatment\n  of the transition noise in the discrete simulation modeling for recursive\n  filters"]}]
