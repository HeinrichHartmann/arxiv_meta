On the microscopic field theory side, we present new results\nconcerning the counting of black hole microstates for charge vectors with\nnontrivial arithmetic duality invariants. On the macroscopic gravitational\nside, we present a novel application of localization techniques to a\nsupergravity functional integral to compute the quantum entropy of these black\nholes. Localization leads to an enormous simplification of a path integral of\nstring theory in AdS_2 by reducing it to a finite dimensional integral. The\nlocalizing solutions are labeled by n_v+1 parameters, with n_v the number of\nvector multiplets in the theory of N=2 supergravity. As an example we show, for\nfour dimensional large black holes which preserve four supersymmetries in\ntoroidally compactified IIB string theory, that the macroscopic degeneracy\nprecisely agrees with all the terms in an exact Rademacher expansion of the\nmicroscopic answer except for Kloosterman sums which in principle can be\ncomputed. Generalizing previous work, these finite charge contributions to the\nleading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can also be viewed as an instance of \"exact\nholography\" in the context of AdS_2/CFT_1 correspondence.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1111.1161,\n  arXiv:1012.0265"]}]
