The definition of restricted sensitivity is similar to that of global\nsensitivity except that instead of quantifying over all possible datasets, we\ntake advantage of any beliefs about the dataset that a querier may have, to\nquantify over a restricted class of datasets. Specifically, given a query f and\na hypothesis H about the structure of a dataset D, we show generically how to\ntransform f into a new query f_H whose global sensitivity (over all datasets\nincluding those that do not satisfy H) matches the restricted sensitivity of\nthe query f. Moreover, if the belief of the querier is correct (i.e., D is in\nH) then f_H(D) = f(D). If the belief is incorrect, then f_H(D) may be\ninaccurate.\n  We demonstrate the usefulness of this notion by considering the task of\nanswering queries regarding social-networks, which we model as a combination of\na graph and a labeling of its vertices. In particular, while our generic\nprocedure is computationally inefficient, for the specific definition of H as\ngraphs of bounded degree, we exhibit efficient ways of constructing f_H using\ndifferent projection-based techniques. We then analyze two important query\nclasses: subgraph counting queries (e.g., number of triangles) and local\nprofile queries (e.g., number of people who know a spy and a computer-scientist\nwho know each other).

This requires a repumper laser to\nmaintain the ion in the Doppler cooling cycle. Typically the 2D3/2 state, or\nsome of its hyperfine components if the ion has nuclear spin, has a higher\nmultiplicity than the upper state of the repumping transition. This can lead to\ndark states, which have to be destabilized by an external magnetic field or by\nmodulating the polarization of the repumper laser. We propose using\nunpolarized, incoherent amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) to drive the\nrepumping transition. An ASE source offers several advantages compared to a\nlaser. It prevents the buildup of dark states without external polarization\nmodulation even in zero magnetic field, it can drive multiple hyperfine\ntransitions simultaneously, and it requires no frequency stabilization. These\nfeatures make it very compact and robust, which is essential for the\ndevelopment of practical, transportable optical ion clocks. We construct a\ntheoretical model for the ASE radiation, including the possibility of the\nsource being partially polarized. Using 88Sr+ as an example, the performance of\nthe ASE source compared to a single-mode laser is analyzed by numerically\nsolving the eight-level density matrix equations for the involved energy\nlevels.

It is well known that the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium for\na bimatrix game (2-NASH) can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem\n(LCP). In addition, 2-NASH is known to be complete in the complexity class PPAD\n(Polynomial-time Parity Argument Directed).

In\nparticular, any endpoint of this graph (with the exception of the initial point\nof the algorithm) corresponds to either a solution or to a so-called secondary\nray. Thus, an LCP problem is verified as belonging to PPAD if any secondary ray\ncan be used to construct, in polynomial time, a certificate that there is no\nsolution to the problem.

In this work we propose a problem that considers the use of\nrate adaptation as the energy saving strategy in networks. The problem is\nmodeled as an integral demand-routing problem in a network with discrete cost\nfunctions at the links. The discreteness of the cost function comes from the\ndifferent states (bandwidths) at which links can operate and, in particular,\nfrom the energy consumed at each state. This in its turn leads to the\nnon-convexity of the cost function, and thus adds complexity to solve this\nproblem. We formulate this routing problem as an integer program, and we show\nthat the general case of this problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate.\nFor the special case when the step ratio of the cost function is bounded, we\nshow that effective approximations can be obtained. Our main algorithm executes\ntwo processes in sequence: relaxation and rounding. The relaxation process\neliminates the non-convexity of the cost function, so that the problem is\ntransformed into a fractional convex program solvable in polynomial time. After\nthat, a randomized rounding process is used to get a feasible solution for the\noriginal problem. This algorithm provides a constant approximation ratio for\nuniform demands and an approximation ratio of $O(\\log^{\\beta-1} d)$ for\nnon-uniform demands, where $\\beta$ is a constant and $d$ is the largest demand.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 2 figures"]}]
