We show, from a microscopic calculation, that when an electron\nis added at the edge of the ground state in the [N_1, N_2] sector, where N_1\nand N_2 are the numbers of composite fermions in the lowest two {\\Lambda}\nlevels, the resulting state lies in either [N_1 + 1, N_2] or [N_1, N_2 + 1]\nsector; adding an electron at the edge is thus equivalent to adding a composite\nfermion at the edge. The coupling to other sectors of the form [N_1 + 1 + k,\nN_2 - k], k integer, is negligible in the asymptotically low-energy limit. This\nstudy also allows a detailed and substantial comparison with the two-boson\nmodel of the 2/5 edge. We compute the spectral weights and find that while the\nindividual spectral weights are complicated and non-universal, their sum is\nconsistent with an effective two-boson description of the 2/5 edge.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures"]}]

For hypergraphs, the node\ndegree $\\ell$ (number of hyperedges connected to a node) and the number of\nneighbors $k$ of a node differ from each other in contrast to the case of\ngraphs. Here, I calculate the distribution of the number of node neighbors in\nrandom hypergraphs in which hyperedges of uniform rank $r$ have a homogeneous\nprobability $p$ to appear. This distribution is equivalent to the degree\ndistribution of ensembles of projected graphs from hypergraph or bipartite\nnetwork ensembles, where the projection connects any two nodes in the projected\ngraph when they are also connected in the hypergraph or bipartite network.

It has been suggested that the baryonic\ncondensation of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) due to cooling may drag dark\nmatter to the cores and thus steepen the profile. In this work, we search for\nevidence of ongoing ICM cooling in the first large, well-defined sample of\nstrong lensing selected galaxy clusters in the range 0.1 < z < 0.6. Based on\nknown correlations between the ICM cooling rate and both optical emission line\nluminosity and star formation, we measure, for a sample of 89 strong lensing\nclusters, the fraction of clusters that have [OII]3727 emission in their\nbrightest cluster galaxy (BCG). We find that the fraction of line-emitting BCGs\nis constant as a function of redshift for z > 0.2 and shows no statistically\nsignificant deviation from the total cluster population. Specific star\nformation rates, as traced by the strength of the 4000 angstrom break, D_4000,\nare also consistent with the general cluster population. Finally, we use\noptical imaging of the SL clusters to measure the angular separation, R_arc,\nbetween the arc and the center of mass of each lensing cluster in our sample\nand test for evidence of changing [OII] emission and D_4000 as a function of\nR_arc, a proxy observable for SL cross-sections. D_4000 is constant with all\nvalues of R_arc, and the [OII] emission fractions show no dependence on R_arc\nfor R_arc > 10\" and only very marginal evidence of increased weak [OII]\nemission for systems with R_arc < 10\".

Though edge singularities\nare ubiquitous and play a fundamental role in two-dimensional problems, tensor\nproduct real-valued wavelets are known to be only sub-optimal since they can\nonly capture edges well along the coordinate axis directions. The dual tree\ncomplex wavelet transform (DTCWT), proposed by Kingsbury [16] and further\ndeveloped by Selesnick et al. [24], is one of the most popular and successful\nenhancements of the classical tensor product real-valued wavelets. The\ntwo-dimensional DTCWT is obtained via tensor product and offers improved\ndirectionality with 6 directions. In this paper we shall further enhance the\nperformance of DTCWT for the problem of image denoising. Using framelet-based\napproach and the notion of discrete affine systems, we shall propose a family\nof tensor product complex tight framelets TPCTF_n for all integers n>2 with\nincreasing directionality, where n refers to the number of filters in the\nunderlying one-dimensional complex tight framelet filter bank.

In\nparticular, TPCTF_4, which is different to DTCWT in both nature and design,\nprovides an alternative to DTCWT. Indeed, TPCTF_4 behaves quite similar to\nDTCWT by offering 6 directions in dimension two, employing the tensor product\nstructure, and enjoying slightly less redundancy than DTCWT. When TPCTF_4 is\napplied to image denoising, its performance is comparable to DTCWT. Moreover,\nbetter results on image denoising can be obtained by using TPCTF_6.

This quantity is believed to play a key role in\nsolar activity due to its conservation property. Helicity is continuously\ninjected into the corona during the evolution of active regions (ARs). To\nbetter understand and quantify the role of magnetic helicity in solar activity,\nthe distribution of magnetic helicity flux in ARs needs to be studied. The\nhelicity distribution can be computed from the temporal evolution of\nphotospheric magnetograms of ARs such as the ones provided by SDO/HMI and\nHinode/SOT. Most recent analyses of photospheric helicity flux derive an\nhelicity flux density proxy based on the relative rotation rate of photospheric\nmagnetic footpoints. Although this proxy allows a good estimate of the\nphotospheric helicity flux, it is still not a true helicity flux density\nbecause it does not take into account the connectivity of the magnetic field\nlines. For the first time, we implement a helicity density which takes into\naccount such connectivity. In order to use it for future observational studies,\nwe test the method and its precision on several types of models involving\ndifferent patterns of helicity injection. We also test it on more complex\nconfigurations - from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations - containing\nquasi-separatrix layers. We demonstrate that this connectivity-based helicity\nflux density proxy is the best to map the true distribution of photospheric\nhelicity injection.\n","Comment: Solar Physics, June 2013 (this is the version of the author, a\n  definitive version is now available in the online journal)"]}]
