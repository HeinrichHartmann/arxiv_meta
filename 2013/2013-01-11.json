The first tier of coarse-graining provides the averaged effect of the\nmedium upon the field, quantified by a complex permittivity (in the frequency\ndomain) describing the response of the dielectric to the field in addition to\nits back action on the field through a stochastic forcing term.

They exhibit extremely high star formation rates, and\nmost of them seem to harbour an AGN. They are unique laboratories to\ninvestigate the most extreme star formation, and its connection to\nsuper-massive black hole growth. The AGN and SB relative contributions to the\ntotal output in these objects is still debated. Our aim is to disentangle the\nAGN and SB emission of a sample of thirteen HLIRG. We have studied the MIR low\nresolution spectra of a sample of thirteen HLIRG obtained with the IRS on board\nSpitzer. The 5-8 {\\mu}m range is an optimal window to detect AGN activity even\nin a heavily obscured environment. We performed a SB/AGN decomposition of the\ncontinuum using templates, successfully applied for ULIRG in previous works.\nThe MIR spectra of all sources is largely dominated by AGN emission. Converting\nthe 6 {\\mu}m luminosity into IR luminosity, we found that ~80% of the sample\nshows an IR output dominated by the AGN emission. However, the SB activity is\nsignificant in all sources (mean SB contribution ~30%), showing star formation\nrates ~300-3000 solar masses per year. Using X-ray and MIR data we estimated\nthe dust covering factor (CF) of these HLIRG, finding that a significant\nfraction presents a CF consistent with unity. Along with the high X-ray\nabsorption shown by these sources, this suggests that large amounts of dust and\ngas enshroud the nucleus of these HLIRG, as also observed in ULIRG. Our results\nare in agreement with previous studies of the IR SED of HLIRG using radiative\ntransfer models, and we find strong evidence that all HLIRG harbour an AGN.\nThis work provides further support to the idea that AGN and SB are both crucial\nto understand the properties of HLIRG. Our study of the CF supports the\nhypothesis that HLIRG can be divided in two different populations.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables. Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

The hierarchical model\nfollows the natural organization of population data and the top level in the\nhierarchy provides a common frame of reference for multigroup shape analysis,\ne.g. classification and hypothesis testing. Unlike typical shape-modeling\napproaches, the proposed model is a generative model that defines a joint\ndistribution of object-boundary data and the shape-model variables.\nFurthermore, it naturally enforces optimal correspondences during the process\nof model fitting and thereby subsumes the so-called correspondence problem. The\nproposed inference scheme employs an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm\nthat treats the individual and group shape variables as hidden random variables\nand integrates them out before estimating the parameters (population mean and\nvariance and the group variances). The underpinning of the EM algorithm is the\nsampling of pointsets, in Kendall shape space, from their posterior\ndistribution, for which we exploit a highly-efficient scheme based on\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation.

Spanners are very well studied in the literature.

However, the\nlist of icy minor bodies moving in orbits with an inclination above 40 deg. has\nincreased in recent years. The origin of these bodies, and in particular of\nthose objects in retrograde orbits, is not well determined, and different\nscenarios are considered. In this paper, we present new observational and\ndynamical data of two objects in retrograde orbits, 2008 YB3 and 2005 VD. We\nfind that the surface of these extreme objects is depleted of ices and does not\ncontain the 'ultra-red' matter typical of some Centaurs. Despite small\ndifferences, these objects share common colors and spectral characteristics\nwith the Trojans, comet nuclei, and the group of grey Centaurs. All of these\npopulations are supposed to be covered by a mantle of dust responsible for\ntheir reddish- to neutral-color. To investigate if the surface properties and\ndynamical evolution of these bodies are related, we integrate their orbits for\n10^(8) years to the past. We find a remarkable difference in their dynamical\nevolutions: 2005 VD' s evolution is dominated by a Kozai resonance with planet\nJupiter while that of 2008 YB3 is dominated by close encounters with planets\nJupiter and Saturn. Our models suggest that the immediate site of provenance of\n2005 VD is the in the Oort cloud, whereas for 2008 YB3 it is in the\ntrans-Neptunian region. Additionally, the study of their residence time shows\nthat 2005 VD has spent a larger lapse of time moving in orbits in the region of\nthe giant planets than 2008 YB3. Together with the small differences in color\nbetween these two objects, with 2005 VD being more neutral than 2008 YB3, this\nfact suggests that the surface of 2005 VD has suffered a higher degree of\nprocessing, probably related to cometary activity episodes.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics: 28\n  November 2012"]}]

In this paper, we propose to\nexploit users' preferences as a basis for adapting OLAP (On-Line Analytical\nProcessing) queries to the user. For this, we present a user profile-driven\ndata warehouse approach that allows dening user's profile composed by his/her\nidentifier and a set of his/her preferences. Our approach is based on a general\ndata warehouse architecture and an adaptive OLAP analysis system. Our main idea\nconsists in creating a data warehouse materialized view for each user with\nrespect to his/her profile. This task is performed off-line when the user\ndefines his/her profile for the first time. Then, when a user query is\nsubmitted to the data warehouse, the system deals with his/her data warehouse\nmaterialized view instead of the whole data warehouse. In other words, the data\nwarehouse view summaries the data warehouse content for the user by taking into\naccount his/her preferences. Moreover, we are implementing our data warehouse\npersonalization approach under the SQL Server 2005 DBMS (DataBase Management\nSystem).\n"]}]

Its significance is largely reflected in, hence also\nconfined to, several existing interpretations in various source coding\nproblems. This paper attempts to both generalize its definition and to expand\nits practical significance by providing a new operational interpretation. The\ngeneralization is two-folded: the number of dependent variables can be\narbitrary, so are the alphabet of those random variables. New properties are\ndetermined for the generalized Wyner's common information of N dependent\nvariables. More importantly, a lossy source coding interpretation of Wyner's\ncommon information is developed using the Gray-Wyner network. In particular, it\nis established that the common information equals to the smallest common\nmessage rate when the total rate is arbitrarily close to the rate distortion\nfunction with joint decoding. A surprising observation is that such equality\nholds independent of the values of distortion constraints as long as the\ndistortions are within some distortion region.
