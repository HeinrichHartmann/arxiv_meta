One direct operational manifestation of these\nuncertainty relations is a purely quantum effect referred to as information\nlocking. A locking scheme can be viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a\nuniformly random n-bit message is encoded in a quantum system using a classical\nkey of size much smaller than n. Without the key, no measurement of this\nquantum state can extract more than a negligible amount of information about\nthe message, in which case the message is said to be \"locked\".

In\nthis paper, we make the following contributions by exploiting a connection\nbetween uncertainty relations and low-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. We\nintroduce the notion of metric uncertainty relations and connect it to\nlow-distortion embeddings of L2 into L1. A metric uncertainty relation also\nimplies an entropic uncertainty relation.

As an attempt to discriminate among several possible\nproduction scenarios, astrophysicists try to test the statistical isotropy of\nthe directions of arrival of these cosmic rays. At the highest energies, they\nare supposed to point toward their sources with good accuracy. However, the\nobservations are so rare that testing the distribution of such samples of\ndirectional data on the sphere is nontrivial. In this paper, we choose a\nnonparametric framework that makes weak hypotheses on the alternative\ndistributions and allows in turn to detect various and possibly unexpected\nforms of anisotropy. We explore two particular procedures. Both are derived\nfrom fitting the empirical distribution with wavelet expansions of densities.\nWe use the wavelet frame introduced by [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 38 (2006b) 574-594\n(electronic)], the so-called needlets. The expansions are truncated at scale\nindices no larger than some ${J^{\\star}}$, and the $L^p$ distances between\nthose estimates and the null density are computed. One family of tests (called\nMultiple) is based on the idea of testing the distance from the null for each\nchoice of $J=1,\\ldots,{J^{\\star}}$, whereas the so-called PlugIn approach is\nbased on the single full ${J^{\\star}}$ expansion, but with thresholded wavelet\ncoefficients. We describe the practical implementation of these two procedures\nand compare them to other methods in the literature. As alternatives to\nisotropy, we consider both very simple toy models and more realistic\nnonisotropic models based on Physics-inspired simulations. The Monte Carlo\nstudy shows good performance of the Multiple test, even at moderate sample\nsize, for a wide sample of alternative hypotheses and for different choices of\nthe parameter ${J^{\\star}}$. On the 69 most energetic events published by the\nPierre Auger Collaboration, the needlet-based procedures suggest statistical\nevidence for anisotropy. Using several values for the parameters of the\nmethods, our procedures yield $p$-values below 1%, but with uncontrolled\nmultiplicity issues.

We answer this open question in the\naffirmative (with a slightly different collection of resources): Our adaptive\ncoding scheme tolerates any error rate below 2/7 and we show that tolerating a\nhigher error rate is impossible. We also show that in the setting of Franklin\net al. [CRYPTO'13], where parties share randomness not known to the adversary,\nadaptivity increases the tolerable error rate from 1/2 to 2/3.

Most prior work considered coding schemes with linear\namount of communication, while allowing unbounded computations. We argue that\nstudying tolerable error rates in this relaxed context helps to identify a\nsetting's intrinsic optimal error rate. We set forward a strong working\nhypothesis which stipulates that for any setting the maximum tolerable error\nrate is independent of many computational and communication complexity\nmeasures.

Regional photochemical models have been\ndeveloped to study the impacts of emission reductions on ozone levels. The\nstandard approach is to run the deterministic model under new emission levels\nand attribute the change in ozone concentration to the emission control\nstrategy. However, running the deterministic model requires substantial\ncomputing time, and this approach does not provide a measure of uncertainty for\nthe change in ozone levels.

Its restriction to\nmultilinearity has known exponential lower bounds but no nontrivial blackbox\nidentity tests. In this paper we take a step towards designing such\nhitting-sets. We define a notion of distance for multilinear depth-$3$ circuits\n(say, in $n$ variables and $k$ product gates) that measures how far are the\npartitions from a mere refinement. The $1$-distance strictly subsumes the\nset-multilinear model, while $n$-distance captures general multilinear\ndepth-$3$. We design a hitting-set in time poly($n^{\\delta\\log k}$) for\n$\\delta$-distance. Further, we give an extension of our result to models where\nthe distance is large (close to $n$) but it is small when restricted to certain\nvariables. This implies the first subexponential whitebox PIT for the sum of\nconstantly many set-multilinear depth-$3$ circuits.\n  We also explore a new model of read-once algebraic branching programs (ROABP)\nwhere the factor-matrices are invertible (called invertible-factor ROABP).

Many such tree models\nhave been proposed, from the simple single- tree model to more complex tree\nensembles. Their non-parametric formulation allows for effective and efficient\nmodeling of datasets exhibiting complex non-linear relationships between the\nmodel pre- dictors and observations. However, the mixing behavior of the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler is sometimes poor. This is because the\nproposals in the sampler are typically local alterations of the tree structure,\nsuch as the birth/death of leaf nodes, which does not allow for efficient\ntraversal of the model space. This poor mixing can lead to inferential\nproblems, such as under-representing uncertainty. In this paper, we develop\nnovel proposal mechanisms for efficient sampling. The first is a rule\nperturbation proposal while the second we call tree rotation. The perturbation\nproposal can be seen as an efficient variation of the change proposal found in\nexisting literature. The novel tree rotation proposal is simple to implement as\nit only requires local changes to the regression tree structure, yet it\nefficiently traverses disparate regions of the model space along contours of\nequal probability. When combined with the classical birth/death proposal, the\nresulting MCMC sampler exhibits good acceptance rates and properly represents\nmodel uncertainty in the posterior samples. We implement this sampling\nalgorithm in the Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model and demonstrate\nits effectiveness on a prediction problem from computer experiments and a test\nfunction where structural tree variability is needed to fully explore the\nposterior.\n"]}]

At midrapidity, $A_{N}$ is measured for neutral pion and eta mesons\nreconstructed from diphoton decay, and at forward rapidities, neutral pions are\nmeasured using both diphotons and electromagnetic clusters. The neutral-pion\nmeasurement of $A_{N}$ at midrapidity is consistent with zero with\nuncertainties a factor of 20 smaller than previous publications, which will\nlead to improved constraints on the gluon Sivers function. At higher\nrapidities, where the valence quark distributions are probed, the data exhibit\nsizable asymmetries. In comparison with previous measurements in this kinematic\nregion, the new data extend the kinematic coverage in $\\sqrt{s}$ and $p_T$, and\nit is found that the asymmetries depend only weakly on $\\sqrt{s}$. The origin\nof the forward $A_{N}$ is presently not understood quantitatively. The extended\nreach to higher $p_T$ probes the transition between transverse momentum\ndependent effects at low $p_T$ and multi-parton dynamics at high $p_T$.\n","Comment: 451 authors, 16 pages, 11 figures, and 10 tables.

Measurements were performed on lysozyme samples,\nhydrated respectively with heavy water (D2O) to capture the protein dynamics,\nand with light water (H2O), to probe the dynamics of the hydration shell, in\nthe temperature range from 210 $<$ T $<$ 260 K. The hydration fraction in both\ncases was about $\\sim$ 0.38 gram of water per gram of dry protein. The field\nstrengths investigated were respectively 0 kV/mm and 2 kV/mm (2 10$^6$ V/m) for\nthe protein hydrated with D2O and 0 kV and 1 kV/mm for the H2O hydrated\ncounterpart. While the overall internal protons dynamics of the protein appears\nto be unaffected by the application of electric field up to 2 kV/mm, likely due\nto the stronger intra-molecular interactions, there is also no appreciable\nquantitative enhancement of the diffusive dynamics of the hydration water, as\nwould be anticipated based on our recent observations in water confined in\nsilica pores under field values of 2.5 kV/mm. This may be due to the difference\nin surface interactions between water and the two adsorption hosts (silica and\nprotein), or to the existence of a critical threshold field value Ec $\\sim$ 2-3\nkV/mm for increased molecular diffusion, for which electrical breakdown is a\nlimitation for our sample.\n","Comment: 12 Pages, 5 Figures, submitted to Journal of Biological Physics"]}]
