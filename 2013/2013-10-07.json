The performance of parallel\nimaging strongly depends on the reconstruction algorithm, which can proceed\neither in the original k-space (GRAPPA, SMASH) or in the image domain\n(SENSE-like methods). To improve the performance of the widely used SENSE\nalgorithm, 2D- or slice-specific regularization in the wavelet domain has been\ndeeply investigated. In this paper, we extend this approach using 3D-wavelet\nrepresentations in order to handle all slices together and address\nreconstruction artifacts which propagate across adjacent slices. The gain\ninduced by such extension (3D-Unconstrained Wavelet Regularized -SENSE:\n3D-UWR-SENSE) is validated on anatomical image reconstruction where no temporal\nacquisition is considered. Another important extension accounts for temporal\ncorrelations that exist between successive scans in functional MRI (fMRI).

We show how partial wave unitarity\nplaces an upper bound on the mass of the mediator (or dark) Higgs when its mass\nis increased to be the largest scale in the effective theory.
