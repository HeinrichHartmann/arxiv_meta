It is our contention that a blind\nacceptance of worst-case scenarios may lead to designs that are actually more\ndangerous than designs based on probabilistic techniques with a built-in risk\nfactor. The real issue is one of modeling. If one accepts that no mathematical\nmodel of uncertainties is perfect then a probabilistic approach can lead to\nmore reliable control even if it cannot guarantee stability for all possible\ncases. Our presentation is based on case analysis. We first establish that\nworst-case is not necessarily \"all-encompassing.\" In fact, we show that for\nsome uncertain control problems to have a conventional robust control solution\nit is necessary to make assumptions that leave out some feasible cases. Once we\nestablish that point, we argue that it is not uncommon for the risk of\nunaccounted cases in worst-case design to be greater than that of the accepted\nrisk in a probabilistic approach. With an example, we quantify the risks and\nshow that worst-case can be significantly more risky. Finally, we join our\nanalysis with existing results on computational complexity and probabilistic\nrobustness to argue that the deterministic worst-case analysis is not\nnecessarily the better tool.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 2 figures"]}]

Many of these\napplications are actively being researched upon. Almost all these applications\nneed bipartite graphs of the order of tens of thousands in practice, whose\nnodes represent parallel computations. To reduce its implementation cost,\nreducing amount of system/hardware resources during design is an important\nengineering objective. In this context, we present a scheme to reduce resource\nutilization when performing computations derived from PG-based graphs. In a\nfully parallel design based on PG concepts, the number of processing units is\nequal to the number of vertices, each performing an atomic computation. To\nreduce the number of processing units used for implementation, we present an\neasy way of partitioning the vertex set. Each block of partition is then\nassigned to a processing unit. A processing unit performs the computations\ncorresponding to the vertices in the block assigned to it in a sequential\nfashion, thus creating the effect of folding the overall computation. These\nblocks have certain symmetric properties that enable us to develop a\nconflict-free schedule. The scheme achieves the best possible throughput, in\nlack of any overhead of shuffling data across memories while scheduling another\ncomputation on the same processing unit. This paper reports two folding\nschemes, which are based on same lattice embedding approach, based on\npartitioning. We first provide a scheme for a projective space of dimension\nfive, and the corresponding schedules.

One usually think that it is extremely\nimportant for the measurement of triple Higgs coupling at the high luminosity\nLHC. In this paper, we propose to search for the extra Higgs boson (denoted as\n$S$) utilizing pair production of the SM-like Higgs boson ($H$) which was\ndiscovered in July, 2012.The pair production of $H$ can be huge due to the\nresonant production of heavy scalar $S$, namely $PP \\rightarrow S \\rightarrow\nHH$. The couplings of $H$ with weak gauge boson are similar to ones in the SM\nand it implies that the couplings between $S$ and gauge bosons are likely\nsuppressed. Provided that $S$ is heavy enough, the decay into weak gauge bosons\nmay not be the dominant modes. Instead $S$ can decay into a pair of $H$ and\noffer the promising channel to discover it. In this paper, we studied the 5\npromising decay modes of $H$, i.e. $b\\bar{b}$, $WW^*$, $ZZ^*$, $\\gamma\\gamma$\nand $\\tau^+\\tau^-$, and simulated the signals and backgrounds for the 15\ncombination modes for $HH$ at the LHC with $\\sqrt{s}= 14$ TeV and integrated\nluminosity $\\mathcal{L}=1000fb^{-1}$.

The selected asteroids fill the flux gap between the\nsub-mm/mm calibrators Mars, Uranus and Neptune, and the mid-IR bright\ncalibration stars. All three Herschel instruments observed asteroids for\nvarious calibration purposes, including pointing tests, absolute flux\ncalibration, relative spectral response function, observing mode validation,\nand cross-calibration aspects. Here we present newly established models for the\nfour large and well characterized main-belt asteroids (1) Ceres, (2) Pallas,\n(4) Vesta, and (21) Lutetia which can be considered as new prime flux\ncalibrators. The relevant object-specific properties (size, shape,\nspin-properties, albedo, thermal properties) are well established. The seasonal\n(distance to Sun, distance to observer, phase angle, aspect angle) and daily\nvariations (rotation) are included in a new thermophysical model setup for\nthese targets. The thermophysical model predictions agree within 5% with the\navailable (and independently calibrated) Herschel measurements. The four\nobjects cover the flux regime from just below 1,000 Jy (Ceres at mid-IR\nN-/Q-band) down to fluxes below 0.1 Jy (Lutetia at the longest wavelengths).\nBased on the comparison with PACS, SPIRE and HIFI measurements and pre-Herschel\nexperience, the validity of these new prime calibrators ranges from\nmid-infrared to about 700 micron, connecting nicely the absolute stellar\nreference system in the mid-IR with the planet-based calibration at sub-mm/mm\nwavelengths.\n","Comment: Published in Experimental Astronomy, 78 pages, 10 figures, 19 tables"]}]

Although the histories\nof genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because\ngenes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can\nco-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events.\nBuilding models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can\nthus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and\nvice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one\ndirection or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are\nknown. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and\nspecies trees. In this article we review the various models that have been used\nto describe the relationship between gene trees and species trees.

Simulations as well as empirical studies on\ngenomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of\nsequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better\ngene trees provide a better basis for studying genome evolution or\nreconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences.

The aims of this study are to refine the photometric-based\nAMIGA sample of isolated galaxies and to provide an improvement of the\nquantification of the isolation degree with respect to previous works, using\nboth photometry and spectroscopy. We developed an automatic method to search\nfor neighbours within a projected area of 1 Mpc radius centred on each primary\ngalaxy to revise the CIG isolation criteria. Of the 636 CIG galaxies considered\nin the photometric study, 426 galaxies fulfil the CIG isolation criteria within\n1 Mpc, taking into account projected neighbours. Of the 411 CIG galaxies\nconsidered in the spectroscopic study, 347 galaxies fulfil the CIG isolation\ncriteria when a criterion about redshift difference is added. The available\nredshifts allow us to reject background neighbours and thus improve the\nphotometric assessment. For the first time, the environment and the isolation\ndegree of AMIGA galaxies are quantified using digital data. The use of the SDSS\ndatabase permits one to identify fainter and smaller-size satellites than in\nprevious AMIGA works. About 50% of the neighbours considered as potential\ncompanions in the photometric study are in fact background objects. We also\nfind that about 92% of the neighbour galaxies that show recession velocities\nsimilar to the corresponding CIG galaxy are not considered by the CIG isolation\ncriteria as potential companions, which may have a considerable influence on\nthe evolution of the central CIG galaxy.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics"]}]
