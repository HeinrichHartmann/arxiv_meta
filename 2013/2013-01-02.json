Direct\nexamination and comparison of condition-specific matrices is challenging due to\nthe large number of elements in a connectivity matrix. We present a framework\nthat uses network analysis to describe condition-specific functional\nconnectivity. Treating the brain as a complex system in terms of a network, we\nextract the most relevant connectivity information by partitioning each network\ninto clusters representing functionally connected brain regions. Extracted\nclusters are used as features for predicting experimental condition in a new\ndata set. The approach is illustrated on fMRI data examining functional\nconnectivity patterns during processing of abstract and concrete concepts.\nTopological (brain regions) and functional (level of connectivity and\ninformation flow) systematic differences in the ROI-based functional networks\nwere identified across participants for concrete and abstract concepts. These\ndifferences were sufficient for classification of previously unseen\nconnectivity matrices as abstract or concrete based on training data derived\nfrom other people.\n"]}]
