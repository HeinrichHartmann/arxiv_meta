At a low spin relaxation rate and at low bias\ncurrents vortices carrying magnetic polarization clouds become polaron-like and\ntheir velocities are determined by the effective drag coefficient which is\nsignificantly bigger than the Bardeen-Stephen (BS) one. As current increases,\nvortices release polarization clouds and the velocity as well as the voltage in\nthe I-V characteristics jump to values corresponding to the BS drag coefficient\nat a critical current $J_c$. The nonuniform components of the magnetic field\nand magnetization drop as velocity increases resulting in weaker polarization\nand {\\it discontinuous} dynamic dissociation depinning transition.\nExperimentally the jump shows up as a depinning transition and the\ncorresponding current at the jump is the depinning current. As current\ndecreases, on the way back, vortices are retrapped by polarization clouds at\nthe current $J_r<J_c$. As a result, polaronic effect suppresses dissipation and\nenhances critical current.

We consider the case in\nwhich the matter content is a minimally coupled scalar field and the spatial\nsections are flat and compact, with the topology of a three-torus. The\nquantization is carried out along the lines that were put forward by the\nauthors in a previous work for spherical topology. The action of the system is\ntruncated at second order in perturbations. The local gauge freedom is fixed at\nthe classical level, although different gauges are discussed and shown to lead\nto equivalent conclusions. Moreover, descriptions in terms of gauge-invariant\nquantities are considered. The reduced system is proven to admit a symplectic\nstructure, and its dynamical evolution is dictated by a Hamiltonian constraint.\nThen, the background geometry is polymerically quantized, while a Fock\nrepresentation is adopted for the inhomogeneities. The latter is selected by\nuniqueness criteria adapted from quantum field theory in curved spacetimes,\nwhich determine a specific scaling of the perturbations. In our hybrid\nquantization, we promote the Hamiltonian constraint to an operator on the\nkinematical Hilbert space.

Battery-operated sensors are\nseverely constrained by the amount of energy that can be spend for transmitting\nthese sensed data. However, aggregation of data (including removal of redundant\ndata) at intermediate sensors and forwarding of aggregate data reduce overall\nenergy consumptions in WSN. In general, data gathering refers to the process of\nperiodic collection of sensed data from various sensors to one or more base\nstations (BS). Energy efficient data gathering scheduling is essential for\nimproving the lifetime of WSN. In this paper, we propose a distributed\nalgorithm to compute data-gathering schedule that aim to improve the lifetime\nof WSN by suitably selecting energy-efficient data-flow paths from various\nsensors to the base station. For a multihop WSN with $n$ sensors, the proposed\nalgorithm first computes a schedule in $O(n^2)$ time steps, and then this\nschedule is periodically updated based the residual energy and the feedback\nreceived from the BS. The system performs approximately $\\log(\\mathcal{L})$\nschedule updates where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the expected lifetime of the system in\nnumber of data-gathering rounds. Moreover, each updation process uses the\nexisting active schedule (data-flow path) - thus consuming only a small\nfraction of a single data gathering round activity. Such an algorithm thus\ncould precisely incorporate the energy consumptions due to updates and related\nactivities. Moreover, our algorithm does not assume any global knowledge of the\ntopology or the positions of various sensors.

Indeed the\ngravitational field should depend on the relative contribution of the particle\ndark matter distribution to the baryonic one, itself depending on the\nindividual assembly history and environment of the galaxy, including a lot of\ncomplex feedback mechanisms.

Here\nwe demonstrate non-trivial quantum evolution steered by dynamical decoupling\ncontrol, which automatically suppresses the noise effect. We designed and\nimplemented a self-protected controlled-NOT gate on the electron spin of a\nnitrogen-vacancy centre and a nearby carbon-13 nuclear spin in diamond at room\ntemperature, by employing an engineered dynamical decoupling control on the\nelectron spin. Final state fidelities of 0.91 and 0.88 were observed even with\nimperfect initial states. In the mean time, the qubit coherence time has been\nelongated by at least 30 folds. The design scheme does not require that the\ndynamical decoupling control commute with the qubit interaction and works for\ngeneral systems. This work marks a step toward realistic quantum computing.\n","Comment: Originally submitted version.

The proposed parallelization attained\nan efficiency of 90% in a distributed system with about 800 CPU cores.
