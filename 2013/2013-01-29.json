Here simulations of this NVU dynamics are compared to results for\nfour other dynamics, both deterministic and stochastic. First, NVU dynamics is\ncompared to the standard energy-conserving Newtonian NVE dynamics by\nsimulations of the Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones liquid, its WCA version\n(i.e., with cut-off's at the pair potential minima), and the Gaussian\nLennard-Jones liquid. We find identical results for all quantities probed:\nradial distribution functions, incoherent intermediate scattering functions,\nand mean-square displacement as function of time. Arguments are then presented\nfor the equivalence of NVU and NVE dynamics in the thermodynamic limit; in\nparticular to leading order in 1/N these two dynamics give identical\ntime-autocorrelation functions. In the final section NVU dynamics is compared\nto Monte Carlo dynamics, to a diffusive dynamics of small-step random walks on\nthe constant-potential-energy hypersurface, and to Nose-Hoover NVT dynamics. If\ntime is scaled for the two stochastic dynamics to make their single-particle\ndiffusion constants identical to those of NVE dynamics, the simulations show\nthat all five dynamics are equivalent at low temperatures except at short\ntimes.\n"]}]

If a finite amount of heat is supplied, the stresses gradually\ndisappear as temperature becomes homogeneous throughout the sphere. We show\nthat before this happens, there is a temporary lowering of pressure and density\nin the interior of the sphere, inducing a transient lowering of the temperature\nhere. For ordinary solids this effect is small because c_p is almost equal to\nc_V. For fluent liquids the effect is negligible because their dynamic shear\nmodulus vanishes. For a liquid at its glass transition, however, the effect is\ngenerally considerably larger than in solids. This paper presents analytical\nsolutions of the relevant coupled thermoviscoelastic equations. In general,\nthere is a difference between the isobaric specific heat, c_p, measured at\nconstant isotropic pressure and the longitudinal specific heat, c_l, pertaining\nto mechanical boundary conditions that confine the associated expansion to be\nlongitudinal. In the exact treatment of heat propagation the heat diffusion\nconstant contains c_l rather than c_p. We show that the key parameter\ncontrolling the magnitude of the \"cooling-by-heating\" effect is the relative\ndifference between these two specific heats. For a typical glass-forming\nliquid, when temperature at the surface is increased by 1 K, a lowering of the\ntemperature in the sphere center of order 5 mK is expected if the experiment is\nperformed at the glass transition.

This is shown to be capacity for the 3-user channel with\narbitrary channel gains and the sum-capacity for the symmetric K-user channel.\nInterestingly. for the K user channel having only the K th cognitive know all\nthe other messages is sufficient to achieve capacity i.e cognition at\ntransmitter 2 to K-1 is not needed. Next the sum capacity of the symmetric\nGaussian noise channel is characterized to within a constant additive and\nmultiplicative gap. The proposed achievable scheme for the additive gap is\nbased on Dirty paper coding and can be thought of as a MIMO-broadcast scheme\nwhere only one encoding order is possible due to the message sharing structure.\nAs opposed to other multiuser interference channel models, a single scheme\nsuffices for both the weak and strong interference regimes. With this scheme\nthe generalized degrees of freedom (gDOF) is shown to be a function of K, in\ncontrast to the non cognitive case and the broadcast channel case.\nInterestingly, it is show that as the number of users grows to infinity the\ngDoF of the K-user cognitive interference channel with cumulative message\nsharing tends to the gDoF of a broadcast channel with a K-antenna transmitter\nand K single-antenna receivers. The analytical additive additive and\nmultiplicative gaps are a function of the number of users. Numerical\nevaluations of inner and outer bounds show that the actual gap is less than the\nanalytical one.\n","Comment: Journal"]}]

We have used a Bayesian analysis in\nthe time domain, accelerated using the recently developed ABC-method which\nconsists of a form of lossy linear data compression. The TOAs were first\nprocessed with Tempo2, where the design matrix was extracted for use in a\nsubsequent Bayesian analysis. We used different noise models to analyse the\ndatasets: no red noise, red noise the same for all pulsars, and individual red\nnoise per pulsar. We sampled from the likelihood with four different samplers:\n\"emcee\", \"t-walk\", \"Metropolis-Hastings\", and \"pyMultiNest\". All but emcee\nagreed on the final result, with emcee failing due to artefacts of the\nhigh-dimensionality of the problem. An interesting issue we ran into was that\nthe prior of all the 36 (red) noise amplitudes strongly affects the results. A\nflat prior in the noise amplitude biases the inferred GWB amplitude, whereas a\nflat prior in log-amplitude seems to work well. This issue is only apparent\nwhen using a noise model with individually modelled red noise for all pulsars.\nOur results for the blind challenges are in good agreement with the injected\nvalues. For the GWB amplitudes we found h_c = 1.03 +/- 0.11 [10^{-14}], h_c =\n5.70 +/- 0.35 [10^{-14}], and h_c = 6.91 +/- 1.72 [10^{-15}], and for the GWB\nspectral index we found gamma = 4.28 +/- 0.20, gamma = 4.35 +/- 0.09, and gamma\n= 3.75 +/- 0.40. We note that for closed challenge 3 there was quite some\ncovariance between the signal and the red noise: if we constrain the GWB\nspectral index to the usual choice of gamma = 13/3, we obtain the estimates:\nh_c = 10.0 +/- 0.64 [10^{-15}], h_c = 56.3 +/- 2.42 [10^{-15}], and h_c = 4.83\n+/- 0.50 [10^{-15}], with one-sided 2 sigma upper-limits of: h_c <= 10.98\n[10^{-15}], h_c <= 60.29 [10^{-15}], and h_c <= 5.65 [10^{-15}].\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Detailed predictions are made for the dependence of the lattice Kondo\nresonance and the conduction electron spectral density on temperature and band\nfilling $n_{c}$. Two low-energy scales are identified in the spectra: a\nrenormalized hybridization pseudogap scale $T^{*}$, which correlates with the\nsingle-ion Kondo scale, and a lattice Kondo scale $T_{0} < T^{*}$, which acts\nas the Fermi-liquid coherence scale. The lattice Kondo resonance is split into\na main branch, which is pinned at the Fermi level, and whose width is set by\n$T_{0}$, and an upper branch at $\\omega\\approx T^{*}$. The weight of the upper\nbranch decreases rapidly away from $n_{c}=1$ and vanishes for $n_{c}\\lesssim\n0.7$. In contrast, the pseudogap in the conduction electron spectral density\npersists for all $n_{c}$. On increasing temperature, the lattice Kondo\nresonance at the Fermi level vanishes on a temperature scale of order $10\nT_{0}$, as in impurity model calculations. In contrast to impurity model\nspectra, however, the position of the lattice Kondo resonance depends strongly\non temperature, particularly close to the Kondo insulating state. The results\nare used to make predictions on the temperature dependence of the low-energy\nphotoemission and inverse photoemission spectra of metallic heavy fermions and\ndoped Kondo insulators. We compare our results with available high-resolution\nmeasurements on YbInCu$_4$ and YbAgCu$_4$. The loss in intensity with\nincreasing temperature, and the asymmetric lineshape of the low-energy spectra\nare well accounted for by our model.
