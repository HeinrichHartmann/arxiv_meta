Similar results are found for networks with SFboth\nand SFout topologies. The functionality of the SFout topology, which most\nclosely resembles the structure of biological gene networks (Babu et al.,\n2004), is compared to the ER topology in further detail through an extension to\nmultiple target outputs, with either an oscillatory or a non-oscillatory\nnature. For multiple oscillatory targets of the same length, the differences\nbetween SFout and ER networks are enhanced, but for non-oscillatory targets\nboth types of networks show fairly similar evolvability. We find that SF\nnetworks generate oscillations much more easily than ER networks do, and this\nmay explain why SF networks are more evolvable than ER networks are for\noscillatory phenotypes. In spite of their greater evolvability, we find that\nnetworks with SFout topologies are also more robust to mutations than ER\nnetworks. Furthermore, the SFout topologies are more robust to changes in\ninitial conditions (environmental robustness).

To\ncreate and manipulate nonclassical states of light, however, one requires a\nstrong, nonlinear interaction at the single photon level. One approach to\ngenerate suitable interactions is to couple photons to atoms, as in the strong\ncoupling regime of cavity QED systems. In these systems, however, one only\nindirectly controls the quantum state of the light by manipulating the atoms. A\ndirect photon-photon interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which\ntypically induce only weak nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So\nfar, it has not been possible to reach the single-photon Kerr regime, where the\ninteraction strength between individual photons exceeds the loss rate.

The next dominant contribution is found to be\nthrough $W_L^{-}W_R^{-}$ mediation involving both light and heavy right-handed\nneutrino or sterile neutrino exchanges. The quark-lepton symmetric origin of\nthe computed value of the Dirac neutrino mass matrix is also found to play a\ncrucial role in determining these and other results on lepton flavor violating\nbranching ratios for $\\tau \\rightarrow e + \\gamma$, $\\tau \\rightarrow \\mu +\n\\gamma$, and $\\mu \\rightarrow e + \\gamma$ accessible to ongoing search\nexperiments.

We provide a perspective on this problem, called the\nrank-extreme (ReX) association, through studies of the maximum norm of a vector\nof $p$ standard Gaussian variables that has a covariance matrix of rank $d \\le\np$. We find a simple asymptotic upper bound of such extreme values as\n$\\sqrt{d(1-p^{-2/(d-1)})}$. This upper bound is shown to be sharp when the\nentries of the correlation matrix are generated by inner products of i.i.d.\nuniformly distributed unit vectors. This upper bound also takes on an\ninteresting trichotomy phenomenon depending on the limit of $d/\\log{p}$. Based\non this ReX approach, we propose several methods for high-dimensional\ninference.

One advantage\nof this approach is that the asymptotics are in the dimensions $d$ and $p$ but\nnot in the sample size $n$. Thus, the inference can be made even when $n < d\n\\le p$, which allows fast detection of low-dimensional structure. Furthermore,\nthe higher the dimension is, the more accurate the inference is.

These phenomena\nare a direct consequence of the zero rest mass of gravitons, conformal\nnon-invariance of the graviton field, and one-loop finiteness of quantum\ngravity. The effects are due to graviton-ghost condensates arising from the\ninterference of quantum coherent states. Each of coherent states is a state of\ngravitons and ghosts of a wavelength of the order of the horizon scale and of\ndifferent occupation numbers. The state vector of the Universe is a coherent\nsuperposition of vectors of different occupation numbers. To substantiate the\nreliability of macroscopic quantum effects, the formalism of one-loop quantum\ngravity is discussed in detail.

Graphene would thus appear to alleviate some of the drawbacks\nassociated with silicon-based transistors. It is for this reason why such a\nmaterial is considered one of the most prominent candidates to replace silicon\nwithin nano-scale transistors. The major crux here, is that graphene is\nintrinsically gapless, and yet, transistors require a band-gap pertaining to a\nwell-defined ON/OFF logical state. Therefore, exactly as to how one would\ncreate this band-gap in graphene allotropes is an intensive area of growing\nresearch. Existing methods include nano-ribbons, bilayer and multi-layer\nstructures, carbon nanotubes, as well as the usage of the graphene substrates.\nGraphene transistors can generally be classified according to two working\nprinciples. The first is that a single graphene layer, nanoribbon or carbon\nnanotube can act as a transistor channel, with current being transported along\nthe horizontal axis. The second mechanism is regarded as tunneling, whether\nthis be band-to-band on a single graphene layer, or vertically between adjacent\ngraphene layers. The high-frequency graphene amplifier is another talking point\nin recent research, since it does not require a clear ON/OFF state, as with\nlogical electronics. This paper reviews both the physical properties and\nmanufacturing methodologies of graphene, as well as graphene-based electronic\ndevices, transistors, and high-frequency amplifiers from past to present\nstudies. Finally, we provide possible perspectives with regards to future\ndevelopments.\n","Comment: This is an updated version of our review article, due to be published\n  in Contemporary Physics (Sept 2013).

One such\nchiral multiplet is the [(6,3)+(3,6)], which is necessary for a successful\nchiral mixing phenomenology. In the present paper we extend those methods to\nthree light flavors, i.e. to SU_F(3) symmetry and explicitly construct all\nthree necessary chiral SU_L(3)*SU_R(3) multiplets, viz. [(6,3)+(3,6)],\n[(3,3_bar)+(3_bar,3)] and [(3_bar,3)+(3,3_bar)] that are necessary for a\nphenomenologically successful chiral mixing. We complete this analysis by\nconsidering some bi-local baryon fields that are sufficient for the\nconstruction of the \"missing\" spin 1/2 baryon interpolating fields. Bi-local\nbaryon fields have definite total angular momentum only in the local limit. The\nphysical significance of these results lies in the fact that they show that\nthere is no need for higher Fock space components, such as the (q^4 q_bar), in\nthe baryon chiral mixing framework, for the purpose of fitting the observed\naxial couplings and magnetic moments: all of the sufficient \"mirror components\"\nexist as bi-local fields.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 7 tables, published in PRD"]}]

The goal was to explain a proof of a famous theorem by P.\nDeligne about coherent topoi (coherent topoi have enough points) and to show\nhow this theorem is equivalent to G\\\"odel's completeness theorem for first\norder logic. Because it was not possible to cover everything in only three\nhours, the focus was on Barr's and Deligne's theorems. This explains why the\ncorresponding sections have been given more attention. Section 1 and the\nAppendix were added in an attempt to make this document self-contained and\nunderstandable by a reader with a good knowledge of topos theory.\n  A coherent topos is a topos which is equivalent to a Grothendieck topos that\nadmits a site $(C,J)$ such that $C$ has finite limits and there exists a base\nof $J$ with finite covering families. In order to prove that any coherent topos\nhas enough points, it is enough to show that for any coherent topos\n$\\mathcal{E}$ there is a surjective geometric morphism from a topos with enough\npoints to $\\mathcal{E}$. As sheaf topoi over topological spaces have enough\npoints, any surjective geometric morphism from some $Sh(X)$, with $X$ a\ntopological space, to $\\mathcal{E}$ is sufficient. These are provided by Barr's\ntheorem. This is the approach that will be taken here (following MacLane and\nMoerdijk, Sheaves in Geometry and Logic).\n","Comment: 15 pages, Talk at Paris VII"]}]
