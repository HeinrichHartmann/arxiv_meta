All these studies have revealed that\nthe domain periodicity of 180o stripe domains scales with the film thickness\n(d) according to the classical Landau-Lifshitz-Kittel (LLK) scaling law down to\nthe thickness of ~2 nm. In the case of PbTiO3 nanodots, however, we obtained a\nquite striking correlation that for the thickness less than a certain critical\nvalue, dc (~35 nm), the domain width even increases with decreasing thickness\nof the nanodot, which surprisingly indicates a negative value in the LLK\nscaling-law exponent. On the basis of theoretical considerations of dc, we\nattribute this anomalous domain periodicity to the presence of a\nnonferroelectric surface layer, in addition to the finite lateral-size effect\nof a ferroelectric nanodot.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 4 figures"]}]

This is based on a particular average over Gribov copies which avoids\nthe Neuberger zero problem of the standard Fadeev-Popov construction. The\nproposed gauge fixing can be formulated as a local renormalizable field theory\nin four dimensions and is well-suited for analytical calculations. A remarkable\nfeature is that, for what concerns the calculation of ghost and gauge field\ncorrelators, the gauged-fixed action is perturbatively equivalent to a simple\nmassive extension of the Faddeev-Popov action. The renormalization group flow\nof the theory admits infrared safe trajectories, with no Landau pole.

These near-infrared observations are vital for determining the\nenergy budgets of hot Jupiters, since they probe the planet's spectral energy\ndistribution near its peak. The aim of this work is to measure the Ks-band\nsecondary eclipse depth of WASP-33b, the first planet discovered to transit an\nA-type star. This planet receives the highest level of irradiation of all\ntransiting planets discovered to date. Furthermore, its host-star shows\npulsations and is classified as a low-amplitude delta-Scuti. As part of our\nGROUnd-based Secondary Eclipse (GROUSE) project we have obtained observations\nof two separate secondary eclipses of WASP-33b in the Ks-band using the LIRIS\ninstrument on the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). The telescope was\nsignificantly defocused to avoid saturation of the detector for this bright\nstar (K~7.5). To increase the stability and the cadence of the observations,\nthey were performed in staring mode. We collected a total of 5100 and 6900\nframes for the first and the second night respectively, both with an average\ncadence of 3.3 seconds. On the second night the eclipse is detected at the\n12-sigma level, with a measured eclipse depth of 0.244+0.027-0.020 %. This\neclipse depth corresponds to a brightness temperature of 3270+115-160 K. The\nmeasured brightness temperature on the second night is consistent with the\nexpected equilibrium temperature for a planet with a very low albedo and a\nrapid re-radiation of the absorbed stellar light. For the other night the short\nout-of-eclipse baseline prevents good corrections for the stellar pulsations\nand systematic effects, which makes this dataset unreliable for eclipse depth\nmeasurements. This demonstrates the need of getting a sufficient out-of-eclipse\nbaseline.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures. Accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

Such statements would be natural candidates for being added as\naxioms, but how can we obtain them? One classical (and well studied) approach\nis to add to some theory T an axiom that claims the consistency of T. In this\npaper we discuss another approach motivated by Chaitin's version of G\u007f\\\"odel's\ntheorem where axioms claiming the randomness (or incompressibility) of some\nstrings are probabilistically added, and show that it is not really useful, in\nthe sense that this does not help us to prove new interesting theorems. This\nresult answers a question recently asked by Lipton. The situation changes if we\ntake into account the size of the proofs: randomly chosen axioms may help\nmaking proofs much shorter, unless NP=PSPACE. We then study the axiomatic power\nof the statements of type \"the Kolmogorov complexity of x exceeds n\" in\ngeneral. They are \\Pi_1 (universally quantified) statements of Peano\narithmetic. We show that by adding all true statements of this type, we obtain\na theory that proves all true \\Pi_1-statements, and also provide a more\ndetailed classification. In particular, to derive all true \\Pi_1-statements it\nis sufficient to add one statement of this type for each n (or even for\ninfinitely many n) if strings are chosen in a special way. On the other hand,\none may add statements of this type for most x of length n (for every n) and\nstill obtain a weak theory. We also study other logical questions related to\n\"random axioms\". Finally, we consider a theory that claims Martin-L\u007f\\\"of\nrandomness of a given infinite binary sequence. This claim can be formalized in\ndifferent ways.

In the first part the coupling of soft photon modes to\na source of charged particles is studied in a classical model which can be\nsolved completely in analytical terms. The solution corresponds to a\nre-summation of certain field theory diagrams. The second part addresses the\nderivation of transport equations which also account for the damping width of\nthe particles. The $\\Phi$-derivable method of Baym is used to derive a\nself-consistent and conserving scheme. For this scheme a conserved\nenergy-momentum tensor can be constructed. Furthermore, a kinetic entropy can\nbe derived which besides the standard quasi-particle part also includes\ncontributions from fluctuation.\n","Comment: Talk presented by J.K. at the Thermal-Field-Theory Workshop, TFT 98,\n  Regensburg/Germany, Aug. 10-15, 1998; 10 pages, 2 ps-figures (revised\n  version: a few references have been added according to the referee's\n  suggestion)"]}]
