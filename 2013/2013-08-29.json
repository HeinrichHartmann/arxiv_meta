We investigate this problem by considering a range of\nexact n-body solutions of Einstein's constraint equations. These solutions\ncontain discrete masses, and so allow arbitrarily large density contrasts to be\nmodelled. We restrict our study to regularly arranged distributions of masses\nin topological 3-spheres. This has the benefit of allowing straightforward\ncomparisons to be made with FLRW solutions, as both spacetimes admit a discrete\ngroup of symmetries. It also provides a time-symmetric hypersurface at the\nmoment of maximum expansion that allows the constraint equations to be solved\nexactly. We find that when all the mass in the universe is condensed into a\nsmall number of objects (<10) then the amount of backreaction in dust models\ncan be large, with O(1) deviations from the predictions of the corresponding\nFLRW solutions. When the number of masses is large (>100), however, then our\nmeasures of backreaction become small (<1%). This result does not rely on any\naveraging procedures, which are notoriously hard to define uniquely in general\nrelativity, and so provides (to the best of our knowledge) the first exact and\nunambiguous demonstration of backreaction in general relativistic cosmological\nmodelling.

Our construction is sufficiently general to encompass the\nalgebra of pseudo-differential operators of order zero on smooth manifolds,\nelliptic pseudo-differential operators of order zero, their abstract symbol\n(see Introduction \\S 2.) and their local $K$- theory analytical and topological\nindex classes, see \\cite{Teleman_arXiv_III}, \\S 5, Definition 5 and 6.

A localised algebra\n$\\mathit{A}$ is an algebra in which a decreasing filtration by vector\nsub-spaces $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu}$ is introduced. The filtration $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu}$\ninduces a filtration on the space of matrices $\\mathbb{M}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$.\nAlthough we define solely $K^{loc}_{\\ast}(\\mathit{A})$ for $\\ast= 0, \\; 1$, we\nexpect our construction could be extended in higher degrees. We stress that our\nconstruction of $K^{loc}_{0}(\\mathit{A})$ uses exclusively idempotent matrices\nand that the use of finite projective modules is totally avoided. (Idempotent\nmatrices, rather than projective modules, contain less arbitrariness in the\ndescription of the $K_{0}$ classes and allow a better filtration control). The\ngroup $K^{loc}_{0}(\\mathit{A})$ is by definition the quotient space of the\nspace of the Grothendieck completion of the space of idempotent matrices\nthrough three equivalence relations: -i) stabilisation $\\sim_{s}$, -2) local\nconjugation $\\sim_{l}$, {\\em and} -3) projective limit with respect to the\nfiltration. By definition, the $K_{1}^{loc} (\\mathit{A})$ is the projective\nlimit of the local $K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ groups. The group\n$K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is by definition the quotient of\n$\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ modulo the equivalence relation generated by:\n-1) stabilisation $\\sim_{s}$, --2) local conjugation $\\sim_{l}$ and -3)\n$\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$, where $\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ is\nthe sub-module generated by elements of the form $ u \\oplus u^{-1} $, for any\n$u \\in \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$. The class of any invertible element $u$\nmodulo conjugation (inner auto-morphisms) we call the Jordan canonical form of\n$u$. The local conjugation preserves the local Jordan canonical form of\ninvertible elements. The equivalence relation\n$\\sim_{\\mathbb{O}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})}$ insures existence of opposite elements in\n$K_{1}(\\mathit{A}_{\\mu})$ and $K_{1}^{loc}(\\mathit{A})$. Our definition of\n$K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ does not use the commutator sub-group\n$[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$ nor elementary matrices in\nits construction. We define short exact sequences of localised algebras. To get\nthe corresponding (open) six terms exact sequence (Theorem 51) one has to take\nthe tensor product of the expected six terms exact sequence by\n$\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}]$. We expect the factor\n$\\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1}{2}}]$ to have important consequences. Our work\nshows that the basic structure of $K_{1}$ resides in the {\\em additive}\nsub-group generated by elements of the form $u \\oplus u^{-1}$, $u \\in\n\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})$, rather than in the {\\em multiplicativ} commutator\nsub-group $[\\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A}), \\mathbb{GL}(\\mathit{A})]$. Even into the\ncase of trivially filtered algebras, $\\mathit{A}_{\\mu} = \\mathit{A}$, for all\n$\\mu \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the introduced group $K^{loc}_{1}(\\mathit{A})$ should\nprovide more information than the classical group $K_{1}(\\mathit{A})$.\n","Comment: 30 pages"]}]
