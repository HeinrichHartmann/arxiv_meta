However, the AC susceptibility revealed a dilute-spin-glass like\ntransition below ~ 1 K. Antiferromagnetically coupled Mo5+ 4d1 electrons in\ntriply degenerate t2g orbitals are in this material arranged in a geometrically\nfrustrated fcc lattice. Bulk magnetic susceptibility data has previously been\ninterpreted in terms of a freezing to a heterogeneous state with non-magnetic\nsites where 4d^1 electrons have paired in spin-singlets dimers, and residual\nunpaired Mo5+ 4d1 electrons. Based on the magnetic heat capacity data it has\nbeen suggested that this heterogeneity is the result of kinetic constraints\nintrinsic to the physics of the pure system (possibly due to topological\noverprotection), leading to a self-induced glass of valence bonds between\nneighbouring 4d1 electrons. The muSR relaxation unambiguously points to a\nstatic heterogeneous state with a static arrangement of unpaired electrons\nisolated by spin-singlet (valence bond) dimers between the majority of Mo5+ 4d\nelectrons. The AC susceptibility data indicate that the residual magnetic\nmoments freeze into a dilute-spin-glass-like state. This is in apparent\ncontradiction with the muon-spin decoupling at 50 mK in fields up to 200 mT,\nwhich indicates that, remarkably, the time scale of the field fluctuations from\nthe residual moments is ~ 5 ns. Comparable behaviour has been observed in other\ngeometrically frustrated magnets with spin-liquid-like behaviour and the\nimplications of our observations on Ba2YMoO6 are discussed in this context.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 3 Figures.

Metallic interfaces with similar electronic properties produced by\namorphous oxide overlayers on SrTiO3 have called in question the original\npolarization catastrophe model. We resolve the issue by a comprehensive\ncomparison of (100)-oriented SrTiO3 substrates with crystalline and amorphous\noverlayers of LaAlO3 of different thicknesses prepared under different oxygen\npressures. For both types of overlayers, there is a critical thickness for the\nappearance of conductivity, but its value is always 4 unit cells (around 1.6\nnm) for the oxygen-annealed crystalline case, whereas in the amorphous case,\nthe critical thickness could be varied in the range 0.5 to 6 nm according to\nthe deposition conditions. Subsequent ion milling of the overlayer restores the\ninsulating state for the oxygen-annealed crystalline heterostructures but not\nfor the amorphous ones. Oxygen post-annealing removes the oxygen vacancies, and\nthe interfaces become insulating in the amorphous case. However, the interfaces\nwith a crystalline overlayer remain conducting with reduced carrier density.\nThese results demonstrate that oxygen vacancies are the dominant source of\nmobile carriers when the LaAlO3 overlayer is amorphous, while both oxygen\nvacancies and polarization catastrophe contribute to the interface conductivity\nin unannealed crystalline LaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, and the polarization\ncatastrophe alone accounts for the conductivity in oxygen-annealed crystalline\nLaAlO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures. Furthermore, we find that the crystallinity of\nthe LaAlO3 layer is crucial for the polarization catastrophe mechanism in the\ncase of crystalline LaAlO3 overlayers.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Due to the Lorentz-type dynamics of antiferromagnetic moments (unlike\nthe Galilenian-like dynamics in ferromagnets), the adiabatic spin torque\naffects the characteristic lengthscale of the moving texture.

However, one criticism is the lack\nof a formal definition, which could result in ambiguity for understanding the\nalgorithm. Moreover, previous investigations have mainly focused on its\nempirical aspects. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a formal definition of\nthe algorithm, as well as to perform runtime analyses to revealits theoretical\naspects. In this paper, we define the deterministic version of the DCA, named\nthe dDCA, using set theory and mathematical functions. Runtime analyses of the\nstandard algorithm and the one with additional segmentation are performed. Our\nanalysis suggests that the standard dDCA has a runtime complexity of O(n2) for\nthe worst-case scenario, where n is the number of input data instances. The\nintroduction of segmentation changes the algorithm's worst case runtime\ncomplexity to O(max(nN; nz)), for DC population size N with size of each\nsegment z. Finally, two runtime variables of the algorithm are formulated based\non the input data, to understand its runtime behaviour as guidelines for\nfurther development.\n"]}]

The development of a theory of UEs for\nthese types of systems needs considerably different approaches from that used\nfor UEs of distinguishable systems. This is because the general entanglement of\nidentical particle systems cannot be discussed in the usual way due to the\neffect of (anti)-symmetrization which introduces \"pseudo entanglement\" that is\ninaccessible in practice.
