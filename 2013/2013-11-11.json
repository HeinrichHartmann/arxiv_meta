With already precise experimental\nvalues of epsilon_K, Delta M_d, Delta M_s, CP-asymmetry S_{psi K_S} and of\nhat{B}_K entering the evaluation of epsilon_K, the future of CMFV in the Delta\nF=2 sector depends crucially on the values of |Vcb|, |Vub|, gamma, F_{B_s}\nsqrt{hat B_{B_s}} and F_{B_d} sqrt{hat B_{B_d}}. The ratio xi of the latter two\nparameters, rather precisely determined from lattice calculations, allows then\ntogether with Delta M_s/Delta M_d and S_{psi K_S} to determine the range of\ngamma in the unitarity triangle independently of the value of S(v).

The |Vcb|^4 dependence of\nepsilon_K allows to determine |Vcb| for a given S(v) and gamma with a higher\nprecision than it is presently possible using tree-level decays.

The region in the space of these three parameters allowed by\nCMFV indicates visible problems in this class of models and hints for the\npresence of new sources of flavour violation and/or new local operators in\nDelta F=2 data that are strongly suppressed in these models.

Indices are one of the key ingredients\ntoward efficient query processing strategies via cost-based optimization. Due\nto the apparent absence of a common representation model, it is difficult to\nmake a focused effort toward developing access structures, metrics to evaluate\nquery costs, and choose alternatives. In this context, recent interests in\ncovering-based graph matching appears to be a promising direction of research.\nIn this paper, our goal is to formally introduce a new graph representation\nmodel, called Minimum Hub Cover, and demonstrate that this representation\noffers interesting strategic advantages, facilitates construction of candidate\ngraphs from graph fragments, and helps leverage indices in novel ways for query\noptimization. However, similar to other covering problems, minimum hub cover is\nNP-hard, and thus is a natural candidate for optimization. We claim that\ncomputing the minimum hub cover leads to substantial cost reduction for graph\nquery processing. We present a computational characterization of minimum hub\ncover based on integer programming to substantiate our claim and investigate\nits computational cost on various graph types.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures and 2 algorithms"]}]

To provide incentives for consumers to shift\ntheir consumption to off-peak times, the utility company charges consumers\ndifferential pricing for using power at different times of the day. Consumers\ntake into account these differential prices when deciding when and how much\npower to consume daily. Importantly, while consumers enjoy lower billing costs\nwhen shifting their power usage to off-peak times, they also incur discomfort\ncosts due to the altering of their power consumption patterns. Existing works\npropose stationary strategies for the myopic consumers to minimize their\nshort-term billing and discomfort costs. In contrast, we model the interaction\nemerging among self-interested, foresighted consumers as a repeated energy\nscheduling game and prove that the stationary strategies are suboptimal in\nterms of long-term total billing and discomfort costs. Subsequently, we propose\na novel framework for determining optimal nonstationary DSM strategies, in\nwhich consumers can choose different daily power consumption patterns depending\non their preferences, routines, and needs. As a direct consequence of the\nnonstationary DSM policy, different subsets of consumers are allowed to use\npower in peak times at a low price.

This consistent behavior strongly contrasts with\nthe difference in communication abilities between the individuals. Guided by\nthis universal feature, physicists have proposed that solely alignment rules at\nthe individual level could account for the emergence of unidirectional motion\nat the group level. This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based\nsimulations.
