On the one side, the Bethe Ansatz is a simple\nproduct state of generalised pair operators. On the other hand, the\nRichardson-Gaudin equations are strongly coupled in a non-linear way, making\nthem prone to singularities. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to give a clear\nphysical interpretation to the Richardson-Gaudin variables because no physical\noperator is directly related to the individual variables. Purpose: The purpose\nof this paper is to shed more light on the critical behavior of the\nRichardson-Gaudin equations, and how this is related to the product wave\nstructure of the Bethe Ansatz. Method: A pseudo-deformation of the quasi-spin\nalgebra is introduced, leading towards a Heisenberg-Weyl algebra in the\ncontraction limit of the deformation parameter. This enables an adiabatic\nconnection of the exact Bethe Ansatz eigenstates with pure bosonic multiphonon\nstates. The physical interpretation of this approach is an adiabatic\nsuppression of the Pauli exclusion principle. Results: The method is applied to\na so-called \"picket-fence\" model for the BCS Hamiltonian, displaying a typical\ncritical behavior in the Richardson-Gaudin variables. It was observed that the\nassociated bosonic multiphonon states change collective nature at the critical\ninteraction strengths of the Richardson-Gaudin equations.

We analyse different strategies of local photon\nsubtraction from a two-mode squeezed state in terms of entanglement gain and\nsuccess probability. We develop a general framework that incorporates\nimperfections and losses in all stages of the process: before, during, and\nafter subtraction. By combining all three effects into a single efficiency\nparameter, we provide analytical and numerical results for subtraction\nstrategies using photon-number-resolving and threshold detectors. We compare\nthe entanglement gain afforded by symmetric and asymmetric subtraction\nscenarios across the two modes. For a given amount of loss, we identify an\noptimised set of parameters, such as initial squeezing and subtraction beam\nsplitter transmissivity, that maximise the entanglement gain rate. We identify\nregimes for which asymmetric subtraction of different Fock states on the two\nmodes outperforms symmetric strategies. In the lossless limit, subtracting a\nsingle photon from one mode always produces the highest entanglement gain rate.\nIn the lossy case, the optimal strategy depends strongly on the losses on each\nmode individually, such that there is no general optimal strategy. Rather,\ntaking losses on each mode as the only input parameters, we can identify the\noptimal subtraction strategy and required beam splitter transmissivities and\ninitial squeezing parameter.

The measurement has been carried out with the KLOE detector\noperating at the phi-factory DAFNE in the Italian National Center for Nuclear\nPhysics in Frascati. The KS mesons were identified with high efficiency via\nregistration of these KL mesons which crossed the drift chamber without\ndecaying and then interacted with the KLOE electromagnetic calorimeter. The KS\nfour-momentum vector was then determined using the registered position of the\nKL meson and the known momentum of the phi meson.

In this paper, a genetic algorithm for\npower-aware in scheduling of resource allocation (GAPA) has been proposed to\nsolve the static virtual machine allocation problem (SVMAP). Due to limited\nresources (i.e. memory) for executing simulation, we created a workload that\ncontains a sample of one-day timetable of lab hours in our university. We\nevaluate the GAPA and a baseline scheduling algorithm (BFD), which sorts list\nof virtual machines in start time (i.e. earliest start time first) and using\nbest-fit decreasing (i.e. least increased power consumption) algorithm, for\nsolving the same SVMAP. As a result, the GAPA algorithm obtains total energy\nconsumption is lower than the baseline algorithm on simulated experimentation.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

In this paper, we focus on the problem of sampling random walks\nefficiently in a distributed network and its applications. Given bandwidth\nconstraints, the goal is to minimize the number of rounds required to obtain\nrandom walk samples.\n  All previous algorithms that compute a random walk sample of length $\\ell$ as\na subroutine always do so naively, i.e., in $O(\\ell)$ rounds.

For small diameter graphs, this is a\nsignificant improvement over the naive $O(\\ell)$ bound. Furthermore, our\nalgorithm is optimal within a poly-logarithmic factor as there exists a\nmatching lower bound [Nanongkai et al. PODC 2011]. We further extend our\nalgorithms to efficiently perform $k$ independent random walks in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k\\ell D} + k)$ rounds.

Different from prior works that mainly considered the saturated\nnetwork, we take into account in our analysis the impacts of empty transmit\nbuffers on the interactions and dependencies among links in the network that is\nmore common in practice. It is known that the empty transmit buffer incurs\nextra waiting time for a link to compete for the channel airtime usage, since\nwhen it has no packet waiting for transmission, the link will not perform\nchannel competition. The basic idea behind EAI is that this extra waiting time\ncan be mapped to an equivalent \"longer\" backoff countdown time for the\nunsaturated link, yielding a lower link access intensity that is defined as the\nmean packet transmission time divided by the mean backoff countdown time. That\nis, we can compute the \"equivalent access intensity\" of an unsaturated link to\nincorporate the effects of the empty transmit buffer on its behavior of channel\ncompetition. Then, prior saturated ideal CSMA network (ICN) model can be\nadopted for link throughput computation. Specifically, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm, \"Compute-and-Compare\", to identify which links are unsaturated under\ncurrent offered-load and protocol settings, compute their \"equivalent access\nintensities\" and calculate link throughputs. Simulation shows that our\nalgorithm has high accuracy under various offered-load and protocol settings.\nWe believe the ability to identify unsaturated links and compute links\nthroughputs as established in this paper will serve an important first step\ntoward the design and optimization of general CSMA wireless networks with\noffered-load control.\n","Comment: 6 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1007.5255 by other\n  authors"]}]

Specifically, an energy harvester and a constant energy source driven\nby a non-renewable resource are used for supplying the energy required for\nsystem operation. We first consider a deterministic offline system setting. In\nparticular, assuming availability of non-causal knowledge about energy arrivals\nand channel gains, an offline resource allocation problem is formulated as a\nnon-convex optimization problem taking into account the circuit energy\nconsumption, a finite energy storage capacity, and a minimum required data\nrate. We transform this non-convex optimization problem into a convex\noptimization problem by applying time-sharing and fractional programming which\nresults in an efficient asymptotically optimal offline iterative resource\nallocation algorithm. In each iteration, the transformed problem is solved by\nusing Lagrange dual decomposition. The obtained resource allocation policy\nmaximizes the weighted energy efficiency of data transmission. Subsequently, we\nfocus on online algorithm design. A stochastic dynamic programming approach is\nemployed to obtain the optimal online resource allocation algorithm which\nrequires a prohibitively high complexity. To strike a balance between system\nperformance and computational complexity, we propose a low complexity\nsuboptimal online iterative algorithm which is motivated by the offline\noptimization.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 7 figures, and 1 table.
