Since some of these algorithms involve\nentangled states, it is commonly concluded that entanglement is insufficient to\nenable quantum speedup. As I explain, however, the operations belonging to this\nset are precisely those which will never yield a violation of the Bell\ninequalities. Thus it should be no surprise that entangled quantum states which\nonly undergo operations in this set are efficiently simulable classically. What\nthe Gottesman-Knill theorem shows us is that it is possible to use an entangled\nstate to less than its full potential. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful\nsense in which entanglement is sufficient for quantum speedup: an entangled\nquantum state provides sufficient physical resources to enable quantum speedup,\nwhether or not one elects to use these resources fully.\n","Comment: Only minor changes from last version.
