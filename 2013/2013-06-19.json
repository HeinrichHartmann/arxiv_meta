In addition, the apparent\nambiguities which follow from computing flavor-averaged energies are\nsuppressed. The framework of the generalized theory of quantum measurement also\nprovides some theoretical tools for computing the von-Neumann entropy\ncorrelated to flavor associated energies. It allows for relating flavor\nweighted(averaged) energies to non-selective (selective) quantum measurement\nschemes. As a final issue, the connection of such flavor associated energies\nwith the expressions for neutrino effective mass values is investigated. It is\nstraightforwardly verified that cosmological background neutrino energy\ndensities could be obtained from the coherent superposition of mass\neigenstates. Our results show that the non-selective measurement scheme for\nobtaining flavor-weighted energies is consistent with the predictions from the\nsingle-particle quantum mechanics.\n","Comment: 24 pags, 07 figs.

By using a rigorous variational upper bound to the free energy we are\nled to the evaluation of a partition function that can be computed\nstochastically by sampling electronic wave functions and atomic positions\n(assumed classical). In order to achieve this target we show that it is\nextremely important to consider the non trivial geometry of the space defined\nby the wave function ansatz. The method can be extended to any technique\ncapable to provide an energy value over a given wave function ansatz depending\non several variational parameters and atomic positions. In particular we can\ntake into account electronic correlation, by using the standard variational\nquantum Monte Carlo method, that has been so far limited to zero temperature\nground state properties. We show that our approximation reduces correctly to\nthe standard Born-Oppenheimer (BO) one at zero temperature and to the correct\nhigh temperature limit. At large enough temperatures this method allows to\nimprove the BO, providing lower values of the electronic free energy, because\nwithin this method it is possible to take into account the electron entropy. We\ntest this new method on the simple hydrogen molecule, where at low temperature\nwe recover the correct BO low temperature limit. Moreover, we show that the\ndissociation of the molecule is possible at a temperature much smaller than the\nBO prediction.

An understanding of the potential for\nneutron excitation of the shielding and detector materials is important for\nobtaining this level of sensitivity. Using the broad-spectrum neutron beam at\nLANSCE, we have measured inelastic neutron scattering on $^{nat}$Cu. The goal\nof this work is focused on understanding the background rates from neutrons\ninteracting in these materials in regions around the Q-values of many candidate\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay isotopes, as well as providing data for benchmarking\nMonte Carlo simulations of background events. Results: We extracted the level\ncross sections from the $\\gamma$ production cross section for 46 energy levels\nin $^{nat}$Cu . These level cross sections were compared with the available\nexperimental data, as well as the ENDF/B-VII evaluation for discrete levels. We\nalso examined the potential implications of our measurements on\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ measurements and found that many of the commonly studied\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ isotopes had Q-values below the cutoff for ENDF/B-VII\nevaluated discrete levels in either Cu nucleus.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 18 figures"]}]

When the disc's\nmagnetic field is strong enough to prevent horseshoe motion, the corotation\ntorque is replaced by a torque arising from magnetic resonances. For weak\nenough magnetic fields, horseshoe motion and a corotation torque exist, and\nrecent turbulent MHD simulations have reported the existence of a new component\nof the corotation torque in the presence of a mean toroidal field. The aim of\nthis paper is to investigate the physical origin and the properties of this new\ncorotation torque. We performed MHD simulations of a low mass planet embedded\nin a 2D laminar disc threaded by a weak toroidal magnetic field, with the\neffects of turbulence modelled by a viscosity and a resistivity. We confirm\nthat the interaction between the magnetic field and the horseshoe motion\nresults in an additional corotation torque on the planet, which we dub the MHD\ntorque excess. It is caused by the accumulation of the magnetic field along the\ndownstream separatrices of the planet's horseshoe region, which gives rise to\nan azimuthally asymmetric underdense region at that location. The properties of\nthe MHD torque excess are characterised by varying the slope of the density,\ntemperature and magnetic field profiles, as well as the diffusion coefficients\nand the strength of the magnetic field. The sign of the MHD torque excess\ndepends on the density and temperature gradients only, and is positive for\nprofiles expected in protoplanetary discs. Its magnitude is in turn mainly\ndetermined by the strength of the magnetic field and the turbulent resistivity.\nThe MHD torque excess can be strong enough to reverse migration, even when the\nmagnetic pressure is less than one percent of the thermal pressure.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 20 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Here we consider theories of so-called su(2)_k anyons, well-known\ndeformations of SU(2), in which only the first k+1 angular momenta of SU(2)\noccur. In this manuscript, we discuss in particular anyonic generalizations of\nordinary SU(2) spin chains with an emphasis on anyonic spin S=1 chains. We find\nthat the overall phase diagrams for these anyonic spin-1 chains closely mirror\nthe phase diagram of the ordinary bilinear-biquadratic spin-1 chain including\nanyonic generalizations of the Haldane phase, the AKLT construction, and\nsupersymmetric quantum critical points. A novel feature of the anyonic spin-1\nchains is an additional topological symmetry that protects the gapless phases.\nDistinctions further arise in the form of an even/odd effect in the deformation\nparameter k when considering su(2)_k anyonic theories with k>4, as well as for\nthe special case of the su(2)_4 theory for which the spin-1 representation\nplays a special role. We also address anyonic generalizations of spin-1/2\nchains with a focus on the topological protection provided for their gapless\nground states. Finally, we put our results into context of earlier\ngeneralizations of SU(2) quantum spin chains, in particular so-called (fused)\nTemperley-Lieb chains.\n","Comment: 37 pages, many figures"]}]

Changing some parameters can be much more computationally\nexpensive (`slow') than changing other parameters (`fast parameters'). I\ndescribe a method for decorrelating fast and slow parameters so that parameter\nsampling in the full space becomes almost as efficient as sampling in the slow\nsubspace when the covariance is well known and the distributions are simple.\nThis gives a large reduction in computational cost when there are many fast\nparameters. The method can also be combined with a fast 'dragging' method\nproposed by Neal (2005) that can be more robust and efficient when parameters\ncannot be fully decorrelated a priori or have more complicated dependencies. I\nillustrate these methods for the case of cosmological parameter estimation\nusing data likelihoods from the Planck satellite observations with dozens of\nfast nuisance parameters, and demonstrate a speed up by a factor of five or\nmore. In more complicated cases, especially where the fast subspace is very\nfast but complex or highly correlated, the fast-slow sampling methods can in\nprinciple give arbitrarily large performance gains.

In other words, \\lg n + \\lg \\lg n + O(1) bits of\nspace are necessary and sufficient for representing each of the labels.
