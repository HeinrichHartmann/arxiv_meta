Compact stars can\nhave such exotic states up to their surface (called strange stars (SS)) or they\ncan have quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, known as hybrid stars (HS).\nAs the state of matter of the resultant SS/HS is different from the initial\nhadronic matter, their masses also differ. Therefore, such conversion leads to\nhuge energy release, sometimes of the order of $10^{53}$ ergs. In the present\nwork we study the qualitative energy released by such conversion. Recent\nobservations reveal huge surface magnetic field in certain stars, termed\nmagnetars. Such huge magnetic fields can modify the equations of state (EOS) of\nthe matter describing the star. Therefore, the mass of magnetars are different\nfrom normal NS. The energy released during the conversion process from neutron\nmagnetar (NM) to strange magnetar/hybrid magnetar (SS/HS) is different from\nnormal NS to SS/HS conversion. In this work we calculate the energy release\nduring the phase transition in magnetars. The energy released during NS to\nSS/HS conversion exceeds the energy released during NM to SM/HM conversion. The\nenergy released during the conversion of NS to SS is always of the order of\n$10^{53}$ ergs. The amount of energy released during such conversion can only\nbe compared to the energy observed during the gamma ray bursts (GRB). The\nenergy liberated during NM to HM conversion is few times lesser, and is not\nlikely to power GRB at cosmological distances. However, the magnetars are more\nlikely to lose their energy from the magnetic poles and can produce giant\nflares, which are usually associated with magnetars.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables"]}]

The surface\nequations are similar to the Cauchy's equations for the volume, but involve a\nspecial definition of the 'divergence' (tensorial product of the covariant\nderivatives on the surface and the whole space). The normal component of the\ndivergence equation generalizes the Laplace's equation for a fluid-fluid\ninterface. Assuming that Green's formula remains valid at the contact line\n(despite the singularity), two equations are obtained at this line. The first\none expresses that the fluid-fluid surface tension is equilibrated by the two\nsurface stresses (and not by the volume stresses of the body) and suggests a\nfinite displacement at this line (contrary to the infinite-displacement\nsolution of classical elasticity, in which the surface properties are not taken\ninto account). The second equation represents a strong modification of Young's\ncapillary equation. The validity of Green's formula and the existence of a\nfinite-displacement solution are justified with an explicit example of\nfinite-displacement solution in the simple case of a half-space elastic solid\nbounded by a plane.

Remarkably, the change under pressure in the magnetic state\nof isolated Pr or Tb impurity ions in the nonmagnetic Y host appears to closely\nmirror corresponding changes in pure Pr or Tb metals. The collapse in Tb\nappears to be driven by an enhanced negative exchange interaction between 4f\nand conduction electrons under pressure (Kondo resonance) which, in the case of\nY(Tb), dramatically alters the superconducting properties of the Y host, much\nlike previously found for Y(Pr).

While it is clear that the data can only be explained by a gradual\ntransition, an analysis of the multiscale density field on different scales\nsuggests that colour segregation within the haloes is needed to explain the\nresults.

Our\nframework can deal with phase asynchrony and symbol arrival-time asynchrony\nbetween the signals simultaneously transmitted by multiple sources. A salient\nfeature of this framework is that it can handle both fractional and integral\nsymbol offsets; previously proposed PNC decoding algorithms (e.g., XOR-CD and\nreduced-state Viterbi algorithms) can only deal with fractional symbol offset.\nMoreover, the Jt-CNC algorithm, based on belief propagation (BP), is\nBER-optimal for synchronous PNC and near optimal for asynchronous PNC.\nExtending beyond convolutional codes, we further generalize the Jt-CNC decoding\nalgorithm for all cyclic codes. Our simulation shows that Jt-CNC outperforms\nthe previously proposed XOR-CD algorithm and reduced-state Viterbi algorithm by\n2dB for synchronous PNC. For phase-asynchronous PNC, Jt-CNC is 4dB better than\nthe other two algorithms.

The recent growth of data on complex social systems and the\npotential to derive stories from them has shifted the focus of journalistic and\nscientific attention increasingly toward data-driven journalism and\ncomputational social science.

Using the\nWikiLeaks Afghanistan war logs for illustration, we present an approach that\nbuilds intelligible statistical models for interpretable segments in the data,\nin this case to explore the fatality rates associated with different\ncircumstances in the Afghanistan war. Our approach combines preprocessing by\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with model trees. LDA is used to process the\nnatural language information contained in each report summary by estimating\nlatent topics and assigning each report to one of them. Together with other\nvariables these topic assignments serve as splitting variables for finding\nsegments in the data to which local statistical models for the reported number\nof fatalities are fitted. Segmentation and fitting is carried out with\nrecursive partitioning of negative binomial distributions. We identify segments\nwith different fatality rates that correspond to a small number of topics and\nother variables as well as their interactions. Furthermore, we carve out the\nsimilarities between segments and connect them to stories that have been\ncovered in the media.

The magnetic interaction\nterm derived by Darwin is the same as the, so called, Breit term in\nrelativistic quantum mechanics. While this term always is a small perturbation\nin few body systems it can be shown to be potentially dominating in systems of\nlarge numbers of electrons. It is therefore a natural candidate in the\nexplanation of emergent phenomena---phenomena that only occur in sufficiently\nlarge systems. The dimensionless parameter that indicates the importance of the\nmagnetic energy is the number of electrons times the classical electron radius\ndivided by the size of the system. The number of electrons involved are only\nthe electrons at the Fermi surface; electrons with lower energy cannot\ncontribute to current density and thus not to the magnetic field.\n  The conventional understanding of superconductivity has always been\nproblematic and no really reductionistic derivation exists. The idea that the\ninductive inertia, due to magnetism, is important in the explanation of\nsuperconductivity was first advanced by Frenkel and later brought up by Welker\nbefore it was prematurely discarded. So were theories involving Wigner\ncrystallization. We speculate that the answer requires the combination of a\nWigner lattice and the Darwin interaction. We point out that the Darwin\ninteraction can be shown to have the right order of magnitude to explain the\nenergy scales involved in normal superconductors. The London magnetic moment of\nrotating superconductors and the Meissner effect and their connection are\ndiscussed next. The London moment is shown to indicate that the number of\nelectrons involved in the superconducting condensate is such that the Darwin\ninteraction cannot be neglected.\n","Comment: To appear: Proceedings PIERS 2013 Stockholm, 5 pp"]}]
