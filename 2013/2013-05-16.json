Their spectral energy\ndistribution has a double-humped structure: the first hump lies in the X-ray\nregime, the second in the gamma-ray range. The X-ray emission is generally\nunderstood as synchrotron radiation by highly energetic leptons, the gamma-ray\nemission as Inverse Compton scattering of energetic leptons with ambient photon\nfields. The spectral evolution is influenced by the time-dependent spin-down of\nthe pulsar and the decrease of the magnetic field strength with time. Thus, the\npresent spectral appearance of a PWN depends on the age of the pulsar: while\nyoung PWNe are bright in X-rays and gamma-rays, the X-ray emission of evolved\nPWNe is suppressed. Hence, evolved pulsar wind nebulae may offer an explanation\nof the nature of some of the unidentified VHE (very high-energy, E > 100GeV)\ngamma-ray sources not yet associated with a counterpart at other wavelengths.\nThe purpose of this work is to develop a model which allows to calculate the\nexpected X-ray fluxes of unidentified VHE gamma-ray sources considered to be\nPWN candidates.

One of them, the\nstarburst/Seyfert composite galaxy IRAS 01072+4954 (z=0.0236), has a typical\nType~1 X-ray emission, while its optical spectrum resembles an HII galaxy and\nlacks the expected broad lines. We performed near-infrared integral-field\nobservations of this object with the aim to determine the nature of its nuclear\nemission and to find indications for the existence or absence of a broad-line\nregion. Several reasons have been proposed to explain such peculiar emission.\nWe studied the validity of such hypotheses, including the possibility for it to\nbe True-Seyfert~2. We found little obscuration towards the nucleus A_V = 2.5\nmag, and a nuclear star-formation rate Sigma_SFR < 11.6 Msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2},\nwhich is below the average in Seyferts. Unresolved hot-dust emission with T ~\n1150 K seems to indicate the presence of a torus with its axis close to the\nline of sight. We found that IRAS 01072+4954 hosts a low mass black hole with\nan estimated mass of M_BH ~ 10^5 Msun and an upper limit of 2.5x10^6 Msun. Its\nbolometric luminosity is L_bol ~ 2.5x10^{42} erg/s, which yields a high\naccretion rate with an Eddington ratio ~ 0.2. If the relations found in more\nmassive systems also apply to this case, then IRAS 01072+4954 should show broad\nemission lines with FWHM_{broad} ~(400-600) km/s. Indeed, some indications for\nsuch narrow broad-line components are seen in our data, but the evidence is not\nyet conclusive. This source thus seems not to be a True-Seyfert 2, but an\nextreme case of a narrow line Seyfert 1, which, due to the faintness of the\nactive nucleus, does not have strong FeII emission in the optical.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures.

Adaptation is triggered when a second-order\ntransition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can\nsatisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its\nbehaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints.

A distributed leader election algorithm is presented for\ncomplete $n$-node networks that runs in O(1) rounds and (with high probability)\nuses only $O(\\sqrt{n}\\log^{3/2} n)$ messages to elect a unique leader (with\nhigh probability). When considering the \"explicit\" variant of leader election\nwhere eventually every node knows the identity of the leader, our algorithm\nyields the asymptotically optimal bounds of O(1) rounds and O(n) messages. This\nalgorithm is then extended to one solving leader election on any connected\nnon-bipartite $n$-node graph $G$ in $O(\\tau(G))$ time and\n$O(\\tau(G)\\sqrt{n}\\log^{3/2} n)$ messages, where $\\tau(G)$ is the mixing time\nof a random walk on $G$. The above result implies highly efficient (sublinear\nrunning time and messages) leader election algorithms for networks with small\nmixing times, such as expanders and hypercubes. In contrast, previous leader\nelection algorithms had at least linear message complexity even in complete\ngraphs. Moreover, super-linear message lower bounds are known for\ntime-efficient {\\em deterministic} leader election algorithms.\n  Finally, we present an almost matching lower bound for randomized leader\nelection, showing that $\\Omega(\\sqrt n)$ messages are needed for any leader\nelection algorithm that succeeds with probability at least $1/e + \\eps$, for\nany small constant $\\eps > 0$.\n  We view our results as a step towards understanding the randomized complexity\nofleader election in distributed networks.\n","Comment: Best Paper Award winner at ICDCN 2013, CDCN 2013 14th International\n  Conference on Distributed Computing and Networking.

Our simulations for the first time demonstrate a clear correlation\nbetween the size of the NS kick and anisotropic ejection of heavy elements\ncreated by explosive burning behind the shock. In the case of large NS kicks\nthe explosion is significantly stronger opposite to the kick vector.

Mapping the spatial distribution of the heavy elements in SN\nremnants with identified pulsar motion may offer an important diagnostic test\nof the kick mechanism.

Spectral line formation in the atmosphere of a giant located near\n  the RGB tip"],"description":["  We investigate the role of convection in the formation of atomic and\nmolecular lines in the atmosphere of a red giant star. For this purpose we\nstudy the formation properties of spectral lines that belong to a number of\nastrophysically important tracer elements, including neutral and singly ionized\natoms, and molecules. We focus our investigation on a prototypical red giant\nlocated close to the red giant branch (RGB) tip (Teff=3660K, logg=1.0,\n[M/H]=0.0). We used two types of model atmospheres, 3D hydrodynamical and\nclassical 1D, calculated with the CO5BOLD and LHD stellar atmosphere codes,\nrespectively. Both codes share the same atmospheric parameters, chemical\ncomposition, equation of state, and opacities, which allowed us to make a\nstrictly differential comparison between the line formation properties\npredicted in 3D and 1D. The influence of convection on the spectral line\nformation was assessed with the aid of 3D-1D abundance corrections, which\nmeasure the difference between the abundances of chemical species derived with\nthe 3D hydrodynamical and 1D classical model atmospheres. We find that\nconvection plays a significant role in the spectral line formation in this\nparticular red giant. The derived 3D-1D abundance corrections rarely exceed\n\\pm0.1 dex when lines of neutral atoms and molecules are considered, which is\nin line with the previous findings for solar-metallicity red giants located on\nthe lower RGB. The situation is different with lines that belong to ionized\natoms, or to neutral atoms with high ionization potential. In both cases, the\ncorrections for high-excitation lines (\\chi>8 eV) may amount to \\Delta_3D-1D ~\n-0.4 dex. The 3D--1D abundance corrections generally show a significant\nwavelength dependence; in most cases they are smaller in the near-infrared, at\n1600-2500 nm.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

For several decades, this objective has\nattracted a ceaseless effort to conceive algorithms approaching a good\nminimizer. Our theoretical contributions, summarized below, shed new light on\nthe existing algorithms and can help the conception of innovative numerical\nschemes. To solve the normal equation associated with any $\\m$-row submatrix of\n$A$ is equivalent to compute a local minimizer $\\hu$ of $\\Fd$. (Local)\nminimizers $\\hu$ of $\\Fd$ are strict if and only if the submatrix, composed of\nthose columns of $A$ whose indexes form the support of $\\hu$, has full column\nrank. An outcome is that strict local minimizers of $\\Fd$ are easily computed\nwithout knowing the value of $\\be$. Each strict local minimizer is linear in\ndata. It is proved that $\\Fd$ has global minimizers and that they are always\nstrict. They are studied in more details under the (standard) assumption that\n$\\rank(A)=\\m<\\n$. The global minimizers with $\\m$-length support are seen to be\nimpractical. Given $d$, critical values $\\be_\\k$ for any $\\k\\leq\\m-1$ are\nexhibited such that if $\\be>\\be_\\k$, all global minimizers of $\\Fd$ are\n$\\k$-sparse. An assumption on $A$ is adopted and proved to fail only on a\nclosed negligible subset. Then for all data $d$ beyond a closed negligible\nsubset, the objective $\\Fd$ for $\\be>\\be_\\k$, $\\k\\leq\\m-1$, has a unique global\nminimizer and this minimizer is $\\k$-sparse.

To ensure scalability, the core switches forward traffic on\nhierarchical addresses (grouped by base station) and policy tags (identifying\npaths through middleboxes).
