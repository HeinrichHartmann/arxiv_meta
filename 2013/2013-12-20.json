Fixing the self-force problem amounts to the construction of a\n\\emph{new} theory, which is free of the above pathologies and yet \"sufficiently\nclose\" to the immensely successful original.

The electromagnetic field is the same unquantized classical\nfield, while charges are sufficiently localized conserved currents, accounting\nfor the manifest corpuscular nature of elementary charges.\n  - Symmetries. ECD enjoys the full symmetry group of classical\nelectrodynamics, most importantly the hidden symmetry of scale covariance.\n  - Conservation laws. All ECD conservation laws formally coincide with their\nclassical counterparts, and yet lead to finite conserved quantities.\n  Despite this seemingly classical setting, and the reduction of ECD to\nclassical electrodynamics in the latter's domain of validity, it is shown in\nthe present paper that ensembles of ECD solutions could, in principle,\nreproduce the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics.

These random\nwalks are typically quantum in their behavior, step by step, but they seem to\nshow up a rather classical asymptotic behavior, as opposed to the quantum\nrandom walks usually considered in Quantum Information Theory (such as the\nwell-known Hadamard random walk). Typically, in the case of Open Quantum Random\nWalks on lattices, their distribution seems to always converge to a Gaussian\ndistribution or a mixture of Gaussian distributions. In the case of nearest\nneighbors homogeneous Open Quantum Random Walks on $\\ZZ^d$ we prove such a\nCentral Limit Theorem, in the case where only one Gaussian distribution appears\nin the limit. Through the quantum trajectory point of view on quantum master\nequations, we transform the problem into studying a certain functional of a\nMarkov chain on $\\ZZ^d$ times the Banach space of quantum states. The main\ndifficulty is that we know nothing about the invariant measures of this Markov\nchain, even their existence.

That is, given two arbitrary IP addresses\non the Internet that meet some simple requirements, our proposed technique can\ndiscover packet drops (e.g., due to censorship) between the two remote\nmachines, as well as infer in which direction the packet drops are occurring.\nThe only major requirements for our approach are a client with a global IP\nIdentifier (IPID) and a target server with an open port. We require no special\naccess to the client or server. Our method is robust to noise because we apply\nintervention analysis based on an autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model.\nIn a measurement study using our method featuring clients from multiple\ncontinents, we observed that, of all measured client connections to Tor\ndirectory servers that were censored, 98% of those were from China, and only\n0.63% of measured client connections from China to Tor directory servers were\nnot censored. This is congruent with current understandings about global\nInternet censorship, leading us to conclude that our method is effective.\n","Comment: This is the extended version of a paper from the 2014 Passive and\n  Active Measurements Conference (PAM), March 10th-11th, 2014, Los Angeles,\n  California"]}]
