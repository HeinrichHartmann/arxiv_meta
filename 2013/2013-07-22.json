This specialization brings significant performance gains compared to\nthe common practice of having the same indexes in all replicas, but requires\nthe development of new tuning tools for database administrators. In this paper\nwe introduce RITA (Replication-aware Index Tuning Advisor), a novel\ndivergent-tuning advisor that offers several essential features not found in\nexisting tools: it generates robust divergent designs that allow the system to\nadapt gracefully to replica failures; it computes designs that spread the load\nevenly among specialized replicas, both during normal operation and when\nreplicas fail; it monitors the workload online in order to detect changes that\nrequire a recomputation of the divergent design; and, it offers suggestions to\nelastically reconfigure the system (by adding/removing replicas or\nadding/dropping indexes) to respond to workload changes. The key technical\ninnovation behind RITA is showing that the problem of selecting an optimal\ndesign can be formulated as a Binary Integer Program (BIP). The BIP has a\nrelatively small number of variables, which makes it feasible to solve it\nefficiently using any off-the-shelf linear-optimization software. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that RITA computes better divergent designs compared to\nexisting tools, offers more features, and has fast execution times.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 11 figures"]}]

Global prices at this level create\nconditions where an exacerbating local circumstance can trigger unrest. Global\ncorn (maize) prices reached new highs, and countries that depend mostly on\nmaize are more likely to experience high local food prices and associated\npressures toward social unrest.
