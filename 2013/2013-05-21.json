Therefore, the\nDirac equation is generally equivalent to one fourth-order partial differential\nequation for one real function (A. Akhmeteli, J. Math. Phys. v.52, 082303\n(2011)). These results both belong in textbooks and can be used for development\nof new efficient methods of quantum chemistry. The matter field can be\nalgebraically eliminated both in scalar electrodynamics and in spinor\nelectrodynamics in a certain gauge. The resulting equations describe\nindependent dynamics of the electromagnetic field, which permits mathematical\nsimplification and can be useful for interpretation of quantum theory. For\nexample, in the Bohm interpretation, the electromagnetic field can replace the\nwave function as the guiding field.

Local\ndust storms play a key role in the dust cycle; yet their life cycle is poorly\nknown. Here we use mesoscale modeling that includes the transport of\nradiatively active dust to predict the evolution of a local dust storm\nmonitored by OMEGA on board Mars Express. We show that the evolution of this\ndust storm is governed by deep convective motions. The supply of convective\nenergy is provided by the absorption of incoming sunlight by dust particles,\nrather than by latent heating as in moist convection on Earth. We propose to\nuse the terminology \"rocket dust storm\", or conio-cumulonimbus, to describe\nthose storms in which rapid and efficient vertical transport takes place,\ninjecting dust particles at high altitudes in the Martian troposphere (30 to 50\nkm). Combined to horizontal transport by large-scale winds, rocket dust storms\nproduce detached layers of dust reminiscent of those observed with Mars Global\nSurveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Since nighttime sedimentation is less\nefficient than daytime convective transport, and the detached dust layers can\nconvect during the daytime, these layers can be stable for several days. The\npeak activity of rocket dust storms is expected in low-latitude regions at\nclear seasons (late northern winter to late northern summer), which accounts\nfor the high-altitude tropical dust maxima unveiled by Mars Climate Sounder.\nDust-driven deep convection have strong implications for the Martian dust\ncycle, thermal structure, atmospheric dynamics, cloud microphysics, chemistry,\nand robotic and human exploration.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 13 figures, accepted for Journal of Geophysical Research\n  (Planets)"]}]

This theory is based on a symbolic representation of a\nfractal state-space geometry which is invariant under the action of\ndeterministic and locally causal dynamics. This symbolic representation is\nconstructed from self-similar families of quaternionic operators. Using\nnumber-theoretic properties of the cosine function, the statistical properties\nof the symbolic representation of the invariant set are shown to be consistent\nwith the contextual requirements of the Kochen-Specker theorem, are not\nconstrained by Bell inequalities, and mirror the statistics of entangled\nqubits. These number-theoretic properties in turn reflect the sparseness of the\ninvariant set in state space, and relate to the metaphysical notion of\ncounterfactual incompleteness. Using the concept of probability, the complex\nHilbert Space can be considered the completion of this symbolic representation\ninto the state space continuum. As a result, it is proposed that the complex\nHilbert Space should merely be considered a computational convenience in the\nlight of the algorithmic intractability of the invariant set geometry, and\nconsequently the superposed state should not be considered a fundamental aspect\nof physical theory. The physical basis for the proposed theory is relativistic\ngravity; for example the symbols used to describe the invariant set themselves\nlabel gravitationally distinct cosmological space-times. This implies that the\nvery notion of a `quantum theory of gravity' may be profoundly misguided -\nerroneously putting the quantum cart before the gravitational horse.

BRST symmetry is extended to\ninclude scalar supersymmetry multiplets. Linear realization of scalar\nsupersymmetry with free fields or with fields interacting with background\ngravity is described. Gauge interactions require non-linear realizations of\nscalar supersymmetry and, except for SU(2), non-linear gauge-fixing conditions.\nRequiring scalar supersymmetry of interacting action with the simplest chiral\nmultiplet can reduce the dynamical content of the theory to that of the SM: one\ncomplex scalar, gauge fields, and three generations of Weyl spinors.

Implementation of exact scalar supersymmetry in an\ninteracting string action is given.\n","Comment: 50 pages. Many typos fixed.

Soon after,\nin 1949 Onsager noticed that the scaling properties in inertial range imply\nnon-differentiability of the velocity field in the limit of vanishing\nviscosity. This observation suggests that the turbulence mechanism may be\nrelated to a finite-time singularity (blowup) of incompressible Euler\nequations. However, the existence of such blowup is still an open problem too.\nIn this paper, we show that the blowup indeed represents the driving mechanism\nof inertial range for a simplified (shell) model of turbulence. Here, blowups\ngenerate coherent structures (instantons), which travel through the inertial\nrange in finite time and are described by universal self-similar statistics.\nThe anomaly (deviation of scaling exponents of velocity moments from the\nKolmogorov theory) is related analytically to the process of instanton creation\nusing the large deviation principle.

Often, topological insulators are\ndominated by bulk contributions due to defect induced bulk carriers, making it\ndifficult to isolate the more interesting surface transport characteristics.\nHere, we report the synthesis and characterization of nanosheets of topological\ninsulator Bi2Se3 with variable Sb-doping level to control the electron carrier\ndensity and surface transport behavior. (Bi1-xSbx)2Se3 thin films of thickness\nless than 10 nm are prepared by epitaxial growth on mica substrates in a vapor\ntransport setup. The introduction of Sb in Bi2Se3 effectively suppresses the\nroom temperature electron density from ~4 \\times 10^13/cm^2 in pure Bi2Se3 (x =\n0) to ~2 \\times 10^12/cm^2 in (Bi1-xSbx)2Se3 at x ~0.15, while maintaining the\nmetallic transport behavior. At x > ~0.20, a metal-insulator transition (MIT)\nis observed indicating that the system has transformed into an insulator in\nwhich the metallic surface conduction is blocked. In agreement with the\nobserved MIT, Raman spectroscopy reveals the emergence of vibrational modes\narising from Sb-Sb and Sb-Se bonds at high Sb concentrations, confirming the\nappearance of Sb2Se3 crystal structure in the sample. These results suggest\nthat nanostructured chalcogenide films with controlled doping can be a tunable\nplatform for fundamental studies and electronic applications of topological\ninsulator systems.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Nanoscale.

Collective classification approaches exploit the dependencies of a\ngroup of linked objects whose class labels are correlated and need to be\npredicted simultaneously. In this paper, we focus on studying the collective\nclassification problem in heterogeneous networks, which involves multiple types\nof data objects interconnected by multiple types of links. Intuitively, two\nobjects are correlated if they are linked by many paths in the network.\nHowever, most existing approaches measure the dependencies among objects\nthrough directly links or indirect links without considering the different\nsemantic meanings behind different paths. In this paper, we study the\ncollective classification problem taht is defined among the same type of\nobjects in heterogenous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage\npaths in the network, one can capture the subtlety of different types of\ndependencies among objects. We introduce the concept of meta-path based\ndependencies among objects, where a meta path is a path consisting a certain\nsequence of linke types. We show that the quality of collective classification\nresults strongly depends upon the meta paths used. To accommodate the large\nnetwork size, a novel solution, called HCC (meta-path based Heterogenous\nCollective Classification), is developed to effectively assign labels to a\ngroup of instances that are interconnected through different meta-paths.

The T=0 correlation-induced\ndepletion turns out to stem almost completely from the $^3SD_1$ tensor channel.\nThe isospin-singlet T=0 3SD1 tensor correlations is shown to response for most\nof the depletion, which amounts to more than 70 percent out of the total\ndepletion in the density region considered. The TBF turns out to leads to an\nenhancement of the depletion at high densities well above the empirical\nsaturation density and its effect increases as a function of density.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1301.3218"]}]
