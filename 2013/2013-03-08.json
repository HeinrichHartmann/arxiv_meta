The axion field does not simple double the ordinary light cone\nstructure. In fact, it modifies the global topological structure of light cones\nsurfaces. In CFJ-electrodynamics, such a modification results in violation of\ncausality. In addition, the optical metrics in axion electrodynamics are not\npseudo-Riemannian.

In an\natmospheric experiment, a thermopile filter radiometer tuned to a 9.15{\\mu}m\nabsorption band, associated with infra-red absorption of molecular cluster\nions, was used to monitor changes following events identified by a cosmic ray\ntelescope sensitive to high energy (>400MeV) particles, principally muons. The\nchange in longwave radiation in this absorption band due to molecular cluster\nions is 7 mWm^-2. The integrated atmospheric energy change for each event is\n2Jm^-2, representing an amplification factor of 10^12 compared to the estimated\nenergy density of a typical air shower.

Here, it is shown that this\npractice, which has been widely used in the past three decades or so, is\nphysically wrong for at least two reasons, and that it should be corrected. One\nreason is that the elastic stress tensor sigma is not symmetric while dot{E) is\nsymmetric, so that motions for which sigma + sigma^T <> 0 will give rise to\nelastic stresses which have no viscous pendant. Another reason is that dot{E}\nis frame-invariant, while sigma is not, so that an observer transformation\nwould alter the elastic part of the total stress differently than it would\nalter the dissipative part, thereby violating the fundamental principle of\nmaterial frame-indifference. These problems can have serious consequences for\nnonlinear shear wave propagation in soft solids, as seen here with an example\nof a kink in almost incompressible soft solids.\n"]}]

Case Based Reasoning (CBR) is an emerg- ing decision making\nparadigm in medical research where new cases are solved relying on previously\nsolved similar cases. Usually, a database of solved cases is provided, and\nevery case is described through a set of attributes (inputs) and a label\n(output). Extracting useful information from this database can help the CBR\nsystem providing more reliable results on the yet to be solved cases.\nObjective. For that purpose we suggest a general frame- work where a CBR\nsystem, viz. K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm, is combined with various\ninformation obtained from a Logistic Regression (LR) model. Methods. LR is\napplied, on the case database, to assign weights to the attributes as well as\nthe solved cases. Thus, five possible decision making systems based on K-NN\nand/or LR were identified: a standalone K-NN, a standalone LR and three soft\nK-NN algorithms that rely on the weights based on the results of the LR. The\nevaluation of the described approaches is performed in the field of renal\ntransplant access waiting list. Results and conclusion. The results show that\nour suggested approach, where the K-NN algorithm relies on both weighted\nattributes and cases, can efficiently deal with non relevant attributes,\nwhereas the four other approaches suffer from this kind of noisy setups. The\nrobustness of this approach suggests interesting perspectives for medical\nproblem solving tools using CBR methodology.\n"]}]
