We consider a\nspatial transformation, with which a physical phenomenon described in an\ninitial space is transformed to a deformed space, and interpret the mapping by\nlocal affine transformation point-by-point. Further, we postulate that the\ntransformed material property and field must rebuild the same physical process,\nand that the energy must be conserved at each point during the transformation.\nThese conditions impose the constraint on the transformed relation for material\nproperty and field.

New acoustic\ntransformations with constant density or modulus are also proposed and verified\nby constructing a two-dimensional acoustic cloak.

At high AGN luminosities, a significant correlation is\nobserved between L_fir and L_agn, but only among AGNs at low and moderate\nredshifts (z<1). We interpret this as a signature of the increasing importance\nof major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes\n(SMBHs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high AGN luminosities.\nHowever, we also find that the enhancement of SFR in luminous AGNs weakens or\ndisappears at high redshifts (z>1).

At all redshifts,\nwe find essentially no relationship between L_fir and nuclear obscuration\nacross five orders of magnitude in obscuring column density, suggesting that\nvarious different mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring X-rays\nin active galaxies.

The images of erythrocytes and vesicles were\nanalyzed by the light microscopy system with spatial resolution of better than\n90 nm. The samples were observed in an aqueous environment and required no\nfreezing, dehydration, staining, shadowing, marking or any other manipulation.\nTemperature elevation, whether passive or through exercise, resulted in\nsignificant concentration increase of structurally transformed erythrocytes\n(echinocytes) and vesicles in blood. At temperature of 37 oC, mean vesicle\nconcentrations and diameters in human and rat blood were (1.50+-0.35)x10^6 and\n(1.4+-0.2)x10^6 vesicles/{\\mu}L, and 0.365+-0.065 and 0.436+-0.03 {\\mu}m,\nrespectively. It was estimated that 80% of all vesicles found in human blood\nare smaller than 0.4 {\\mu}m. Thermodynamic analysis of experimental and\nliterature data showed that erythrocyte transformation, vesicle release and\nother associated processes are driven by entropy with enthalpy-entropy\ncompensation. It is suggested that physical state of hydrated cell membrane is\nresponsible for the compensation. The increase of vesicle number related to\nelevated temperatures may be indicative of the heat stress level and serve as\ndiagnostic of erythrocyte stability and human performance.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to the Journal of Thermal Biology on\n  January 25, 2013"]}]

In the mainstream framework of compressed sensing (CS), the vector\nx is recovered from M non-adaptive linear measurements y = xS, where S (of size\nN x M) is typically a Gaussian (or Gaussian-like) design matrix, through some\noptimization procedure such as linear programming (LP).\n  In our proposed method, the design matrix S is generated from an\n$\\alpha$-stable distribution with $\\alpha\\approx 0$. Our decoding algorithm\nmainly requires one linear scan of the coordinates, followed by a few\niterations on a small number of coordinates which are \"undetermined\" in the\nprevious iteration. Comparisons with two strong baselines, linear programming\n(LP) and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), demonstrate that our algorithm can\nbe significantly faster in decoding speed and more accurate in recovery\nquality, for the task of exact spare recovery. Our procedure is robust against\nmeasurement noise. Even when there are no sufficient measurements, our\nalgorithm can still reliably recover a significant portion of the nonzero\ncoordinates.\n  To provide the intuition for understanding our method, we also analyze the\nprocedure by assuming an idealistic setting.

Total hoop stress is typically estimated\nusing the \"Laplace law.\" We show that this procedure is fundamentally flawed\nfor two reasons: Firstly, the Laplace law predicts total stress incorrectly for\nbiological vessels. Furthermore, because muscle and other biological tissue are\nclosely volume-preserving, quantifications of elastic modulus require the\nremoval of the contribution to total stress from incompressibility. We show\nthat this hydrostatic contribution to total stress has a strong\nmaterial-dependent nonlinear response to deformation that is difficult to\npredict or measure.

To be insensitive to\nincompressibility, our method is based on shear stress rather than hoop stress,\nand provides a true measure of the elastic response without application of the\nLaplace law.

We consider DNA strands under a\nvariety of different experimental conditions and show that even in the most\nideal cases, the calculated coherent conductance is much smaller than the\nexperimental conductance. To understand the reasons for this, we carefully look\nat the effect of decoherence. By including decoherence, we show that our model\ncan rationalize the measured conductance of the four strands, both\nqualitatively and quantitatively. We find that the effect of decoherence on G:C\nbase pairs is crucial in getting agreement with the experiments. However, the\ndecoherence on G:C base pairs alone does not explain the experimental\nconductance in strands containing a number of A:T base pairs. Including\ndecoherence on A:T base pairs is also essential.

Members from the former class are coming from the Oort cloud. Those of\nthe latter class were first believed to have migrated from the Kuiper belt\nwhere they could have been accreted in situ, but recent orbital evolution\nsimulations showed that they rather come from the trans-Neptunian scattered\ndisc. These two reservoirs are not where the comets formed: they were expelled\nfrom the inner Solar System following interaction with the giant planets. If\ncomets formed at different places in the Solar System, one would expect they\nshow different chemical and physical properties. In the present paper, I review\nwhich differences are effectively observed: chemical and isotopic compositions,\nspin temperatures, dust particle properties, nucleus properties... and\ninvestigate whether these differences are correlated with the different\ndynamical classes. The difficulty of such a study is that long-period,\nnearly-isotropic comets from the Oort cloud are better known, from Earth-based\nobservations, than the weak nearly-isotropic, short-period comets. On the other\nhand, only the latter are easily accessed by space missions.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the XVIIIemes Rencontres de Blois: Planetary Science:\n  Challenges and Discoveries, 28th May - 2nd June 2006, Blois, France"]}]
