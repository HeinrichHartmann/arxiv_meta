Several toy examples\nare used for comparing distance and similarity correlations.

However, the strong-attraction assumption may\nwell not be the natural one for many neural oscillator models.

Most of the studies on\nRota-Baxter algebras have been for commutative algebras. Two constructions of\nfree commutative Rota-Baxter algebras were obtained by Rota and Cartier in the\n1970s and a third one by Keigher and one of the authors in the 1990s in terms\nof mixable shuffles. Recently, noncommutative Rota-Baxter algebras have\nappeared both in physics in connection with the work of Connes and Kreimer on\nrenormalization in perturbative quantum field theory, and in mathematics\nrelated to the work of Loday and Ronco on dendriform dialgebras and\ntrialgebras.\n  This paper uses rooted trees and forests to give explicit constructions of\nfree noncommutative Rota--Baxter algebras on modules and sets. This highlights\nthe combinatorial nature of Rota--Baxter algebras and facilitates their further\nstudy. As an application, we obtain the unitarization of Rota-Baxter algebras.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]

Under suitable conditions, they form\ncanonical bases of free Rota-Baxter algebras and are studied recently in\nrelation to combinatorics, number theory, renormalization in quantum field\ntheory, and operads. Enumeration of a basis is often a first step to choosing a\ndata representation in implementation. Our method applies some simple ideas\nfrom formal languages and compositions (ordered partitions) of an integer. We\nfirst settle the case of one generator and one operator where both have\nexponent 1 (the idempotent case). Some integer sequences related to these sets\nof Rota-Baxter words are known and connected to other combinatorial sequences,\nsuch as the Catalan numbers, and others are new. The recurrences satisfied by\nthe generating series of these sequences prompt us to discover an efficient\nalgorithm to enumerate the canonical basis of certain free Rota-Baxter\nalgebras. More general sets of Rota-Baxter words are enumerated with summation\ntechniques related to compositions of integers.\n","Comment: 39 pages; corrected minor errors, improved presentation and\n  strengthened results; corrected minor errors in Eq (52) and Corol. 5.2"]}]
