Essentially, a key challenge of\nthis problem is its high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a\ndynamical programming based method to solve this problem. Our method consists\nof two separate stages: an offline pre-processing stage and an online search\nstage. The offline stage pre-computes optimal potential sequence candidates\nfrom a set of pick-up points, and the online stage selects the optimal driving\nroute based on the pre-computed sequences with the current position of an empty\ntaxi. Specifically, for the offline pre-computation, a backward incremental\nsequence generation algorithm is proposed based on the iterative property of\nthe cost function. Simultaneously, an incremental pruning policy is adopted in\nthe process of sequence generation to reduce the search space of the potential\nsequences effectively. In addition, a batch pruning algorithm can also be\napplied to the generated potential sequences to remove the non-optimal ones of\na certain length. Since the pruning effect continuously increases with the\nincrease of the sequence length, our method can search the optimal driving\nroute efficiently in the remaining potential sequence candidates. Experimental\nresults on real and synthetic data sets show that the pruning percentage of our\nmethod is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art methods,\nwhich makes our method can be used to handle the problem of mobile sequential\nrecommendation with more pick-up points and to search the optimal driving\nroutes in arbitrary length ranges.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 17 figures"]}]

Starting from equations\nfor the two-time moments (e.g. for Cxy(t,s), Cxx(t,s)), the method uses an\nexact time-closure condition, in addition to a Gaussian moment closure, in\norder to obtain a closed, non-local in time (causal) subsystem for the one-time\n(t=s) moments. After solving this causal system, the two-time moments can be\ncalculated for all (t,s) pairs as well.

In the case\nwhere the input random process can be obtained as the solution of an It\\^o\nequation (as, e.g., happens with an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process), the proposed\nnon-local system is localized, leading to moment equations identical with the\nusual ones.

In order to bolster their adoption by consumers and hence enhance\ntheir penetration rate, a charging station infrastructure needs to be deployed.\nThis paper studies decentralized policies that assign electric vehicles to a\nnetwork of charging stations with the goal to achieve little to no queueing.\nThis objective is especially important for electric vehicles, whose charging\ntimes are fairly long. The social optimality of the proposed policies is\nestablished in the many-server regime, where each station is equipped with\nmultiple charging slots. Further, convergence issues of the algorithm that\nachieves the optimal policy are examined. Finally, the results provide insight\non how to address questions related to the optimal location deployment of the\ninfrastructure.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 4 figures. Submitted"]}]
