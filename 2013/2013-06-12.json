Such transitions are highly sensitive to\nchanges in the electron-to-proton mass ratio, mu = m_e/m_p, and have different\nresponses to mu-variations.

Motivated by these observations, we show how Doppler\nmeasurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. We show that\nthe atmospheric circulation--and Doppler signature--of hot Jupiters splits into\ntwo regimes. Under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcing\ngenerates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves with\nthe mean flow. In this regime, air along the terminator (as seen during\ntransit) flows toward Earth in some regions and away from Earth in others,\nleading to a Doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshifted\ncomponents. Under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermal\nforcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generate\njets. Strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jet\nformation. As a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated by\nhigh-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifted\nDoppler signature during transit.

In this network, there exist six possible transmission\nmodes: four point-to-point modes (user 1-to-relay, user 2-to-relay,\nrelay-to-user 1, relay-to-user 2), a multiple access mode (both users to the\nrelay), and a broadcast mode (the relay to both users). Most existing protocols\nassume a fixed schedule of using a subset of the aforementioned transmission\nmodes, as a result, the sum rate is limited by the capacity of the weakest link\nassociated with the relay in each time slot. Motivated by this limitation, we\ndevelop a protocol which is not restricted to adhere to a predefined schedule\nfor using the transmission modes. Therefore, all transmission modes of the\nbidirectional relay network can be used adaptively based on the instantaneous\nchannel state information (CSI) of the involved links. To this end, the relay\nhas to be equipped with two buffers for the storage of the information received\nfrom users 1 and 2, respectively.

This approach, which\nuses \"growth graphs\", can also be applied to a wider class of insertion\nalgorithms which have a branching structure, including some of the other\nq-weighted versions of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm which have recently\nbeen introduced by Borodin-Petrov(2013).\n","Comment: 28 pages, many pictures"]}]

A metal-insulator\ntransition is not observed in quenched solid solutions with intermediate\ncompositions but emerges in the thin V-rich layers as the result of phase\nseparation. Interestingly, the metal-insulator transition remains as sharp as\nin pure VO2 even in such thin layers and takes place at significantly reduced\ntemperatures of 310-340 K, which is probably due to a large misfit strain\ninduced by lattice matching at the coherent interface.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 1 figures"]}]

A three-week field survey\nover April 2010 allowed for the acquisition of a dense mesh of\nGround-penetrating Radar (GPR) data with an average of 14683 points per km2\n(67542 points total) on the glacier surface. The profiles were acquired using a\nMala equipment with 100 MHz antennas, towed slowly enough to record on average\nevery 0.3 m, a trace long enough to sound down to 189 m of ice. One profile was\nrepeated with 50 MHz antenna to improve electromagnetic wave propagation depth\nin scattering media observed in the cirques closest to the slopes. The GPR was\ncoupled to a GPS system to position traces. Each profile has been manually\nedited using standard GPR data processing including migration, to pick the\nreflection arrival time from the ice-bedrock interface. Snow cover was\nevaluated through 42 snow drilling measurements regularly spaced to cover all\nthe glacier. These data were acquired at the time of the GPR survey and\nsubsequently spatially interpolated using ordinary kriging. Using a snow\nvelocity of 0.22 m/ns, the snow thickness was converted to electromagnetic wave\ntravel-times and subtracted from the picked travel-times to the ice-bedrock\ninterface. The resulting travel-times were converted to ice thickness using a\nvelocity of 0.17 m/ns. The velocity uncertainty is discussed from a common\nmid-point profile analysis. A total of 67542 georeferenced data points with\nGPR-derived ice thicknesses, in addition to a glacier boundary line derived\nfrom satellite images taken during summer, were interpolated over the entire\nglacier surface using kriging with a 10 m grid size. Some uncertainty analysis\nwere carried on and we calculated an averaged ice thickness of 76 m and a\nmaximum depth of 164 m with a relative error of 11.9%. The volume of the\nglacier is derived as 0.3487$\\pm$0.041 km3. Finally a 10-m grid map of the\nbedrock topography was derived by subtracting the ice thicknesses from a\ndual-frequency GPS-derived digital elevation model of the surface. These two\ndatasets are the first step for modelling thermal evolution of the glacier and\nits bedrock, as well as the main hydrological network.\n"]}]
