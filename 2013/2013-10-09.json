Discovered and characterized by the\nintermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF), iPTF13bxl is the first afterglow\ndiscovered solely based on a GBM localization. Real-time image subtraction,\nmachine learning, human vetting, and rapid response multi-wavelength follow-up\nenabled us to quickly narrow a list of 27,004 optical transient candidates to a\nsingle afterglow-like source. Detection of a new, fading X-ray source by Swift\nand a radio counterpart by CARMA and the VLA confirmed the association between\niPTF13bxl and GRB 130702A. Spectroscopy with the Magellan and Palomar 200-inch\ntelescopes showed the afterglow to be at a redshift of z=0.145, placing GRB\n130702A among the lowest redshift GRBs detected to date. The prompt gamma-ray\nenergy release and afterglow luminosity are intermediate between typical\ncosmological GRBs and nearby sub-luminous events such as GRB 980425 and GRB\n060218. The bright afterglow and emerging supernova offer an opportunity for\nextensive panchromatic follow-up. Our discovery of iPTF13bxl demonstrates the\nfirst observational proof-of-principle for ~10 Fermi-iPTF localizations\nannually. Furthermore, it represents an important step towards overcoming the\nchallenges inherent in uncovering faint optical counterparts to comparably\nlocalized gravitational wave events in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo era.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures"]}]

It describes how\nspecies distribute and perform in response to environmental changes. Ecological\nprocesses and structures are highly complex and adaptive. In order to quantify\nemerging ecological patterns and investigate their hidden mechanisms, we need\nto rely on the simplicity of mathematical language. This becomes especially\napparent when dealing with scaling patterns in ecology. Indeed, nearly all of\necological patterns are scale dependent. Such scale dependence hampers our\npredictive power and creates problems in our inference. This challenge calls\nfor a clear and fundamental understanding of how and why ecological patterns\nchange across scales. As Simon Levin stated in his MacArthur Award lecture, the\nproblem of relating phenomena across scales is the central problem in ecology\nand other natural sciences. It has become clear that there is currently a drive\nin ecology and complexity science to develop new quantitative approaches that\nare suitable for analysing and forecasting patterns of ecological systems. Here\nI provide a road map for future works on synthesizing the scaling patterns in\necology, aiming (i) to collect and sort a diverse array of ecological patterns,\n(ii) to present the dominant parametric forms of how these patterns change\nacross spatial and temporal scales, (iii) to detect the processes and\nmechanisms using mathematical models, and finally (iv) to probe the physical\nmeaning of these scaling patterns.
