Furthermore, an experimental treatment can be applied to whole\nlitters rather than to individual offspring.

With this type of experiment the sample\nsize is the number of litters and not the total number of offspring.

A CSP is typically defined as the\nproblem of finding any consistent labeling for a fixed set of variables\nsatisfying all given constraints between these variables. However, for many\nreal tasks such as job-shop scheduling, time-table scheduling, design?, all\nthese constraints have not the same significance and have not to be necessarily\nsatisfied. A first distinction can be made between hard constraints, which\nevery solution should satisfy and soft constraints, whose satisfaction has not\nto be certain. In this paper, we formalize the notion of possibilistic\nconstraint satisfaction problems that allows the modeling of uncertainly\nsatisfied constraints. We use a possibility distribution over labelings to\nrepresent respective possibilities of each labeling. Necessity-valued\nconstraints allow a simple expression of the respective certainty degrees of\neach constraint. The main advantage of our approach is its integration in the\nCSP technical framework. Most classical techniques, such as Backtracking (BT),\narcconsistency enforcing (AC) or Forward Checking have been extended to handle\npossibilistics CSP and are effectively implemented.
