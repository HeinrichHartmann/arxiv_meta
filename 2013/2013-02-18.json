Kochen-Specker (KS) sets of yes-no\ntests have this property and provide a quantum-versus-classical advantage that\nis free of the initialization problem that affects some quantum computers.\nHere, we report the first experimental implementation of a complete KS set that\nconsists of 18 yes-no tests on four-dimensional quantum systems and show how to\nuse the KS set to obtain a state-independent quantum advantage. We first\ndemonstrate the unique power of this KS set for solving a task while avoiding\nthe problem of state initialization. Such a demonstration is done by showing\nthat, for 28 different quantum states encoded in the orbital-angular-momentum\nand polarization degrees of freedom of single photons, the KS set provides an\nimpossible-to-beat solution. In a second experiment, we generate maximally\ncontextual quantum correlations by performing compatible sequential\nmeasurements of the polarization and path of single photons. In this case,\nstate independence is demonstrated for 15 different initial states. Maximum\ncontextuality and state independence follow from the fact that the sequences of\nmeasurements project any initial quantum state onto one of the KS set's\neigenstates.

It is first examined if\nthe quantum discord is classically described by the hidden-variable model of\nBell in the Hilbert space with $d=2$. The criterion of vanishing quantum\ndiscord is related to the notion of reduction and, surprisingly, the\nhidden-variable model in $d=2$, which has been believed to be consistent so\nfar, is in fact inconsistent and excluded by the analysis of conditional\nmeasurement and reduction. The description of the full contents of quantum\ndiscord by the deterministic hidden-variables models is not possible. We also\nre-examine CHSH inequality. It is shown that the well-known prediction of CHSH\ninequality $|B|\\leq 2$ for the CHSH operator $B$ introduced by Cirel'son is not\nunique. This non-uniqueness arises from the failure of linearity condition in\nthe non-contextual hidden-variables model in $d=4$ used by Bell and CHSH, in\nagreement with Gleason's theorem which excludes $d=4$ non-contextual\nhidden-variables models. If one imposes the linearity condition, their model is\nconverted to a factored product of two $d=2$ models which describes quantum\nmechanical separable states.

Here, the task is to first memorize a set of patterns using a network\nof neurons whose states assume values from a finite number of integer levels.\nLater, the same network should be able to recall previously memorized patterns\nfrom their noisy versions. Prior work in this area consider storing a finite\nnumber of purely random patterns, and have shown that the pattern retrieval\ncapacities (maximum number of patterns that can be memorized) scale only\nlinearly with the number of neurons in the network.\n  In our formulation of the problem, we concentrate on exploiting redundancy\nand internal structure of the patterns in order to improve the pattern\nretrieval capacity. Our first result shows that if the given patterns have a\nsuitable linear-algebraic structure, i.e. comprise a sub-space of the set of\nall possible patterns, then the pattern retrieval capacity is in fact\nexponential in terms of the number of neurons. The second result extends the\nprevious finding to cases where the patterns have weak minor components, i.e.\nthe smallest eigenvalues of the correlation matrix tend toward zero. We will\nuse these minor components (or the basis vectors of the pattern null space) to\nboth increase the pattern retrieval capacity and error correction capabilities.\n  An iterative algorithm is proposed for the learning phase, and two simple\nneural update algorithms are presented for the recall phase. Using analytical\nresults and simulations, we show that the proposed methods can tolerate a fair\namount of errors in the input while being able to memorize an exponentially\nlarge number of patterns.\n","Comment: submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning\n  Systems"]}]

As their nutritional requirements were so huge, their diet holds sway\nover the ecology of many Mesozoic herbivores. The diet of the sauropods is\nlimited by their feeding envelope, which in turn is governed by the posture and\nflexibility of their elongate necks. Yet the exact nature of the flexibility\nand posture of the neck has been a contentious issue. Previous studies have\nutilised computer models of dry bone, mechanical principles or the flexibility\nof the necks of extant animals. However, the effect of the musculature of the\nneck has yet to be investigated. Through measurements of the flexibility of the\nostrich neck after cumulative tissue removal, analyses of the muscle attachment\nsites of the ostrich and sauropods, and testing of the Osteological Neutral\nPose model, this study attempts to rectify this situation. The ostrich neck was\nshown to have three sections of flexibility; a slightly flexible anterior\nsection, a very flexible middle section and a stiff posterior section. The\nOsteological Neutral Pose did not show these sections, and was shown to\npotentially overestimate and underestimate flexibility. It was also found that\nthe inter-vertebral space could account for varying estimates of flexibility,\nand that sauropods would have proportionally more muscle mass at the base of\nthe neck in relation to the ostrich. Ultimately, it was shown that the tissues\nof the neck place the limits of flexibility, and that zygapophyseal overlap\ndoes not indicate the flexibility of the neck. Should the Osteological Neutral\nPose affect sauropod flexibility estimates in the same manner as that of the\nostrich (a general overestimate), then the sauropods would have a more limited\nfeeding envelope than previously thought, allowing for greater niche\npartitioning between groups.\n","Comment: MSc Thesis, University of Bristol, UK, Department of Earth Science.\n  71 Pages"]}]
