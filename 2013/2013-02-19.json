These must relax when the injection\nstops, but not necessarily over the same time (or length) scale as spin\nrelaxation requires spin-dependent interactions while charge relaxation does\nnot. These different relaxation times can be probed by creating a dynamic\nequilibrium between continuous injection and relaxation, which leads to\nconstant-in-time spin and charge imbalances. These scale with their respective\nrelaxation times and with the injection current. While charge imbalances in\nsuperconductors have been studied in great detail both theoretically [8] and\nexperimentally [9], spin imbalances have not received much experimental\nattention [6, 10] despite intriguing theoretical predictions of spin-charge\nseparation effects [11, 12].

It is found that such\nstochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial correlations of\nperturbation velocities, and hence large energy dissipations of perturbation,\nwhich presumably generate instability. A range of angular velocity (\\Omega)\nprofiles of background flow, starting from that of constant specific angular\nmomentum (\\lambda = \\Omega r^2 ; r being the radial coordinate) to that of\nconstant circular velocity (v_\\phi = \\Omega r), is explored. However, all the\nbackground angular velocities exhibit identical growth and roughness exponents\nof perturbations, revealing a unique universality class for the stochastically\nforced hydrodynamics of rotating shear flows. This work, to the best of our\nknowledge, is the first attempt to understand origin of instability and\nturbulence in the three-dimensional Rayleigh stable rotating shear flows by\nintroducing additive noise to the underlying linearized governing equations.\nThis has important implications to resolve the turbulence problem in\nastrophysical hydrodynamic flows such as accretion disks.\n","Comment: 23 pages including 10 figures; to appear in Journal of Physics A:\n  Mathematical and Theoretical"]}]

The presence of a boundary causes an initially\ncircular patch of uniform vorticity to deform. Sufficiently far away from the\nboundary, the deformed shape is well approximated by an ellipse.

This adiabatic invariant arises due to the separation in times\nscales between the relatively rapid time scale associated with the rotation of\nthe patch and the slower time scale associated with the self-advection of the\npatch along the boundary. The interaction of a vortex patch with a circular\nisland is also considered. Without a background flow, conservation of angular\nimpulse implies that the motion is again integrable.

For\nexample, optimisation problems constrained by the time-dependent Navier-Stokes\nequations can be written in tens of lines of code. Based on this high-level\nrepresentation, the framework derives the associated adjoint equations in the\nsame domain-specific language, and uses the FEniCS code generation technology\nto emit parallel optimised low-level C++ code for the solution of the forward\nand adjoint systems. The functional and gradient information so computed is\nthen passed to the optimisation algorithm to update the parameter values.

Shumway and Stoffer presented an\nunconstrained EM algorithm for this class of models in 1982, and a number of\nresearchers have presented EM algorithms for specific types of constrained\nMARSS models since then. In this report, I present a general EM algorithm for\nconstrained MARSS models, where the constraints are on the elements within the\nparameter matrices (B,u,Q,Z,a,R). The constraints take the form vec(M)=f+Dm,\nwhere M is the parameter matrix, f is a column vector of fixed values, D is a\nmatrix of multipliers, and m is the column vector of estimated values. This\nallows a wide variety of constrained parameter matrix forms.

The\nalgorithm allows missing values in y and partially deterministic systems where\n0s appear on the diagonals of Q or R. Open source code for estimating MARSS\nmodels with this algorithm is provided in the MARSS R package on the\nComprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\n","Comment: 58 pages"]}]

Many enzymes\nchange from an open to a closed conformation upon binding of substrate or\ninhibitor molecules.

In this article, we\npresent a general model for the catalysis and inhibition of enzymes with\ninduced-fit binding mechanism. We derive general expressions that specify how\nthe overall catalytic rate of the enzymes depends on the rates for binding, for\nthe conformational changes, and for the chemical reaction. Based on these\nexpressions, we analyze the effect of mutations that mainly shift the\nconformational equilibrium on catalysis and inhibition. If the overall\ncatalytic rate is limited by product unbinding, we find that mutations that\ndestabilize the closed conformation relative to the open conformation increase\nthe catalytic rate in the presence of inhibitors by a factor exp(ddG/RT) where\nddG is the mutation-induced shift of the free-energy difference between the\nconformations. This increase in the catalytic rate due to changes in the\nconformational equilibrium is independent of the inhibitor molecule and, thus,\nmay help to understand how non-active-site mutations can contribute to the\nmulti-drug-resistance that has been observed for the HIV-1 protease.

Existing conventional tensile testing\nmachines can only achieve maximum loading velocities of 500 mm/min, whereas the\nKolsky bar apparatus is more suitable for strain rates > 100/s. In this study,\na custom-designed high rate tension device is developed and calibrated to\nestimate the mechanical properties of brain tissue in tension at strain rates <\n90/s, while maintaining a uniform velocity. The range of strain can also be\nextended to 100% depending on the thickness of a sample. The same apparatus can\nbe used to characterize the dynamic behavior of skin and other soft biological\ntissues by using appropriately sized load cells with a capacity of 10 N and\nabove.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

It has\nbecome a standard technique in functional neuroimaging. In functional\nneuroimaging, so called group ICA (gICA) seeks to identify and quantify\nnetworks of correlated regions across subjects. This paper reports on the\ndevelopment of a new group ICA approach, Homotopic Group ICA (H-gICA), for\nblind source separation of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) data. Resting state brain functional homotopy is the similarity of\nspontaneous fluctuations between bilaterally symmetrically opposing regions\n(i.e. those symmetric with respect to the mid-sagittal plane) (Zuo et al.,\n2010). The approach we proposed improves network estimates by leveraging this\nknown brain functional homotopy. H-gICA increases the potential for network\ndiscovery, effectively by averaging information across hemispheres. It is\ntheoretically proven to be identical to standard group ICA when the true\nsources are both perfectly homotopic and noise-free, while simulation studies\nand data explorations demonstrate its benefits in the presence of noise.\nMoreover, compared to commonly applied group ICA algorithms, the structure of\nthe H-gICA input data leads to significant improvement in computational\nefficiency. A simulation study comfirms its effectiveness in homotopic,\nnon-homotopic and mixed settings, as well as on the landmark ADHD-200 dataset.\nFrom a relatively small subset of data, several brain networks were found\nincluding: the visual, the default mode and auditory networks, as well as\nothers. These were shown to be more contiguous and clearly delineated than the\ncorresponding ordinary group ICA. Finally, in addition to improving network\nestimation, H-gICA facilitates the investigation of functional homotopy via\nICA-based networks.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 13 figures"]}]

We refer to\nthis new distribution as bivariate gamma-geometric (BGG) law. A bivariate\nrandom vector $(X,N)$ follows BGG law if $N$ has geometric distribution and $X$\nmay be represented (in law) as a sum of $N$ independent and identically\ndistributed gamma variables, where these variables are independent of $N$.\nStatistical properties such as moment generation and characteristic functions,\nmoments and variance-covariance matrix are provided. The marginal and\nconditional laws are also studied. We show that BBG distribution is infinitely\ndivisible, just as BEG model is. Further, we provide alternative\nrepresentations for the BGG distribution and show that it enjoys a geometric\nstability property. Maximum likelihood estimation and inference are discussed\nand a reparametrization is proposed in order to obtain orthogonality of the\nparameters. We present an application to the real data set where our model\nprovides a better fit than BEG model. Our bivariate distribution induces a\nbivariate L\\'evy process with correlated gamma and negative binomial processes,\nwhich extends the bivariate L\\'evy motion proposed by Kozubowski et al.

Basic properties such as\nstochastic self-similarity and covariance matrix of the process are presented.\nThe bivariate distribution at fixed time of our ${BMixGNB}$ process is also\nstudied and some results are derived, including a discussion about maximum\nlikelihood estimation and inference.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures"]}]

At 30 C, the intensity of\ncollapse was increased by slower drying. It was considered that: 1) slower\ndrying resulted in higher sample temperature in the early stage of drying to\nincrease the collapse; 2) rapid drying stiffened the surface of sample and such\n\"shell\" prohibited the following collapse; 3) slower drying i.e. longer loading\nof liquid tension caused more remarkable and/or frequent viscoelastic yields of\ncells. Consequently the intensity of collapse increased when the cane was dried\nfrom its waxy outer surface or in the presence of node: both of them retarded\nthe drying. On the other hand, higher drying temperature caused greater\nintensity of collapse in spite of faster drying. It was suggested that the\nthermal softening of cane cells leads to easier yield of the cell wall, at the\nsame time the rapid drying does not allow the recovery of collapse after the\ndisappearance of free water. These results indicated that faster drying at\nlower temperature is preferable for drying cane with less collapse.\n","Comment: Will be published in J. Wood Sci.
