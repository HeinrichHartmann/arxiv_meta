For example, by using the conventional way of setting $\\mu_r \\in\n[m_t/2,2m_t]$, one obtains the total $t \\bar{t}$ production cross-section\n$\\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}$ with the uncertainty $\\Delta \\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}/\\sigma_{t\n\\bar{t}}\\sim ({}^{+3%}_{-4%})$ at the Tevatron and LHC even for the present\nNNLO level. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the\nrenormalization scale ambiguity in precision tests of Abelian QED and\nnon-Abelian QCD theories. In this paper we apply PMC scale-setting to predict\nthe $t \\bar t$ cross-section $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ at the Tevatron and LHC\ncolliders. It is found that $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ remains almost unchanged by\nvarying $\\mu^{\\rm init}_r$ within the region of $[m_t/4,4m_t]$. The convergence\nof the expansion series is greatly improved. For the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel,\nwhich is dominant at the Tevatron, its NLO PMC scale is much smaller than the\ntop-quark mass in the small $x$-region, and thus its NLO cross-section is\nincreased by about a factor of two.

The movement generates leftward fluid flow in the node\ncavity and plays an important role in left-right determination. The leftward\nunidirectional flow results from tilting of the rotational axis of the cilium\nto posterior side. Because of the no-slip boundary condition at the cell\nsurface, the upper stroke away from the boundary generates leftward flow, and\nthe lower stroke close to the boundary generates slower rightward flow. By\ncombining computational fluid dynamics with experimental observations, we\ndemonstrate that the leftward stroke can be more effective than expected for\ncases in which cilia tilting alone is considered with the no-slip condition\nunder constant driving force.

In this work we study the influence of \"leaders\" on\nthe clustering of opinions. Mixed C/PA-societies along with the pure C- and\nPA-society are studied. The influence of the leader's connectivity in the\nnetwork, his toughness or tolerance and his opinion on the opinion dynamics is\nstudied as a function of the initial opinion uncertainty (tolerance) of the\npopulation. Numerical results obtained with leaders at low, high and average\ntolerance show complex bifurcation patterns of the group opinion; a decrease or\neven the total lost of control of the leader over the society is observed in\ndifferent intervals of tolerance of agents in the case of C/PA-societies. We\nfound that in the C-society a leader showing high opinion tolerance has more\ncontrol over the population. In the PA-society a leader changes the bifurcation\npattern of group opinion in a drastic and unexpected way, contrary to the\ncommon sense, and generates stronger polarization in the opposite opinion\ngroups; the connectivity of the leader is an important factor that usually\nimproves the adhesion of agents to the leader's opinion. A low tolerance\n(authoritarian) leader has greater control over a PA-society than that of a\nhigh tolerance (democratic) one; the opposite result is obtained in the\nC-society.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 10 figures"]}]
