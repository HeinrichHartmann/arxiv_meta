For example, by using the conventional way of setting $\\mu_r \\in\n[m_t/2,2m_t]$, one obtains the total $t \\bar{t}$ production cross-section\n$\\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}$ with the uncertainty $\\Delta \\sigma_{t \\bar{t}}/\\sigma_{t\n\\bar{t}}\\sim ({}^{+3%}_{-4%})$ at the Tevatron and LHC even for the present\nNNLO level. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) eliminates the\nrenormalization scale ambiguity in precision tests of Abelian QED and\nnon-Abelian QCD theories. In this paper we apply PMC scale-setting to predict\nthe $t \\bar t$ cross-section $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ at the Tevatron and LHC\ncolliders. It is found that $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}}$ remains almost unchanged by\nvarying $\\mu^{\\rm init}_r$ within the region of $[m_t/4,4m_t]$. The convergence\nof the expansion series is greatly improved. For the $(q\\bar{q})$-channel,\nwhich is dominant at the Tevatron, its NLO PMC scale is much smaller than the\ntop-quark mass in the small $x$-region, and thus its NLO cross-section is\nincreased by about a factor of two.

The movement generates leftward fluid flow in the node\ncavity and plays an important role in left-right determination. The leftward\nunidirectional flow results from tilting of the rotational axis of the cilium\nto posterior side. Because of the no-slip boundary condition at the cell\nsurface, the upper stroke away from the boundary generates leftward flow, and\nthe lower stroke close to the boundary generates slower rightward flow. By\ncombining computational fluid dynamics with experimental observations, we\ndemonstrate that the leftward stroke can be more effective than expected for\ncases in which cilia tilting alone is considered with the no-slip condition\nunder constant driving force.

This is due to the fact that the energy transfer between a transport\nelectron and a conducting terminal is determined by the site most strongly\ncoupled to that terminal. One-dimensional systems with both nearest-neighbor\nand variable-range transport as well as certain types of two-dimensional\nsystems, are considered. For a given sample, the changes in the thermopowers\ndue to modifying the bulk are quite limited, compared with those of the\nconductance. When the small thermopower changes exist, their average over a\nlarge ensemble of mesoscopic samples will vanish. We also obtain the\ndistribution of the thermopower in such an ensemble and show that its width\napproaches a finite limit with increasing sample length. This contrasts with\nthe distribution of conductances in such systems, whose width vanishes in the\nlong sample limit. Finally, we find that the thermal conductances in the\nthree-terminal case have a boundary-dominated contribution, due to\nnon-percolating conduction paths. This contribution can become dominant when\nthe usual conductance is small enough. All our theoretical statements are\nbacked by numerical computations.\n"]}]

A 390, 16 (2011)] we proposed a new bounded confidence\nmodel and studied the self-formation of opinion in heterogeneous societies\ncomposed by agents of two psychological types, concord (C-) and partial\nantagonism (PA-) agents. In this work we study the influence of \"leaders\" on\nthe clustering of opinions. Mixed C/PA-societies along with the pure C- and\nPA-society are studied. The influence of the leader's connectivity in the\nnetwork, his toughness or tolerance and his opinion on the opinion dynamics is\nstudied as a function of the initial opinion uncertainty (tolerance) of the\npopulation. Numerical results obtained with leaders at low, high and average\ntolerance show complex bifurcation patterns of the group opinion; a decrease or\neven the total lost of control of the leader over the society is observed in\ndifferent intervals of tolerance of agents in the case of C/PA-societies. We\nfound that in the C-society a leader showing high opinion tolerance has more\ncontrol over the population. In the PA-society a leader changes the bifurcation\npattern of group opinion in a drastic and unexpected way, contrary to the\ncommon sense, and generates stronger polarization in the opposite opinion\ngroups; the connectivity of the leader is an important factor that usually\nimproves the adhesion of agents to the leader's opinion. A low tolerance\n(authoritarian) leader has greater control over a PA-society than that of a\nhigh tolerance (democratic) one; the opposite result is obtained in the\nC-society.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 10 figures"]}]

There is necessity of the above metrics in wireless sensor\nnetwork where nodes are densely deployed in a given network area. As the nodes\nare deployed densely there is maximum possibility of nodes appear in the\nsensing region of other nodes. So there exists an option that nodes have to\nsend the information that is already reached the base station by its own\ncluster members or by members of other clusters. This mechanism will affect the\nQoI, Energy factor and congestion control of the wireless sensor networks. Even\nthough clustering uses TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) for avoiding\ncongestion control for intra clustering data transmission, but it may fail in\nsome critical situation. This paper proposed a energy efficient clustering\nwhich avoid data redundancy in a dense sensor network until the network becomes\nsparse and hence uses the TDMA efficiently during high density of the nodes.\n","Comment: 9 Pages"]}]

Orbital periods are determined\nfor 5 S-types and pulsation periods for 3 D-types. The most significant D-type\nfound is H1-45 and its carbon Mira with a pulsation period of 408.6 days,\ncorresponding to a distance of ~6.2+-1.4 kpc and M_K=-8.06+-0.12 mag. If H1-45\nbelongs to the Galactic Bulge, then it would be the first bona-fide luminous\nGalactic Bulge carbon star. The lack of luminous carbon stars in the Bulge is a\nlongstanding unsolved problem. A possible explanation for H1-45 may be that the\ncarbon enhancement was accreted from the progenitor of the WD companion. A wide\nvariety of unusual emission line stars were also identified.
