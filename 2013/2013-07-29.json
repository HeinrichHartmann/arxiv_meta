In particular, we use new, ultra-deep data from the IRAC\nUltradeep Field program (IUDF10). Our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxies\nselected as B-dropout Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in the HUDF and one of its\ndeep parallel fields, the HUDF09-2, as well as GOODS-North and South. This\nsample is used to investigate the UV continuum slopes beta and Balmer break\ncolors (J_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. The [4.5]\nfilter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame optical\nemission lines. We find that galaxies at M_z<-21.5 (roughly corresponding to\nL*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. The\nUV continuum slopes and the J_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. The most\nsimple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at these\nredshifts is better described by an SMC-like extinction curve, rather than the\ntypically assumed Calzetti reddening. After correcting for dust, we find that\nthe galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to\n10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function of\nluminosity. In contrast to some results from the literature, we find that only\na small fraction of galaxies shows Balmer break colors which are consistent\nwith extremely young ages, younger than 100 Myr. Under the assumption of smooth\nstar-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies at\nM_z<-19.75. Our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars and\ndust in galaxies at z>4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed in\nshort, intense bursts of star-formation.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures; submitted to ApJ"]}]

We calculate\nit by systematically evaluating the ballistic parts (the Hikami boxes) of the\ncorresponding diagrams and exploiting electroneutrality. Our theory allows one\nto take into account a finite dephasing rate, $\\gamma$, generated by electron\ninteractions, and it is complementary to the non-perturbative results obtained\nfrom a combination of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and the $\\sigma$-model, valid\nat $\\gamma \\to 0$.

In order to optimize the compression, trajectory compression\nalgorithms need to adapt compression ratio subject to the compressibility of\nthe trajectory. Intuitively, the trajectory of an object moving in starlight\nroad is more compressible compared to the trajectory of a object moving in\nwinding roads, therefore, higher compression is achievable in the former case\ncompared to the later. We propose an in-situ compression technique underpinning\nthe support vector regression theory, which accurately predicts the\ncompressibility of a trajectory given the mean speed of the object and then\napply compressive sensing to adapt the compression to the compressibility of\nthe trajectory. The conventional encoding and decoding process of compressive\nsensing uses predefined dictionary and measurement (or projection) matrix\npairs. However, the selection of an optimal pair is nontrivial and exhaustive,\nand random selection of a pair does not guarantee the best compression\nperformance.

We\nalso measure the velocity width values for the sub-DLAs in our sample from\nunsaturated absorption lines of Fe II 2344, 2374, 2600 A, and examine where\nthese systems lie in a plot of metallicity vs. velocity dispersion. Finally, we\nexamine cooling rate vs. H I column density in these sub-DLAs, and compare this\nwith the data from DLAs and the Milky Way ISM. We find that most of the systems\nin our sample show higher cooling rate values compared to those seen in the\nDLAs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Monthly Notices of The Royal\n  Astronomical Society"]}]

We argue that the only solution to this muon deficit, compatible with\nthe observed Xmax distributions, is to reduce the transfer of energy from the\nhadronic shower into the EM shower, by reducing the production or decay of\npi0s. We present four different models of new physics, each with a theoretical\nrationale, which can accomplish this. One has a pure proton composition and\nthree have mixed composition. Two entail new particle physics and suppress pi0\nproduction or decay above LHC energies. The other two are less radical but\nnonetheless require significant modifications to existing hadron production\nmodels -- in one the changes are only above LHC energies and in the other the\nchanges extend to much lower energies. We show that the models have\ndistinctively different predictions for the correlation between the number of\nmuons at ground and Xmax in hybrid events, so that with future hybrid data it\nshould be possible to discriminate between models of new physics and\ndisentangle the particle physics from composition.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 6 figures. 33rd International Cosmic Ray Conference, Rio de\n  Janeiro, 2013.
