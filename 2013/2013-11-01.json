One would like to know whether these remaining supersymmetries are\nregained in the continuum limit $a \\to 0$ and, if not, how much tuning of the\ncouplings in the lattice action is required. In this paper we derive the form\nof these additional twisted supersymmetries by combining a set of discrete\nR-symmetries of the continuum theory with the action of the scalar\nsupersymmetry. We then argue that restoration of rotational symmetry in the\ncontinuum limit of the lattice theory likely implies restoration of R-symmetry\nand hence should lead to an automatic enhancement to the full ${\\cal N}=4$\nsupersymmetry without further fine-tuning.\n","Comment: v3: Published version"]}]

The algorithm samples a candidate\nsolution from a standard multivariate normal distribution scaled by a step-size\nand centered in the current solution. This solution is accepted if it has a\nbetter objective function value than the current one. Crucial to the algorithm\nis the adaptation of the step-size that is done in order to maintain a certain\nprobability of success. The algorithm, already proposed in the 60's, is a\ngeneralization of the well-known Rechenberg's $(1+1)$ Evolution Strategy (ES)\nwith one-fifth success rule which was also proposed by Devroye under the name\ncompound random search or by Schumer and Steiglitz under the name step-size\nadaptive random search. In addition to be derivative-free, the algorithm is\nfunction-value-free: it exploits the objective function only through\ncomparisons. It belongs to the class of comparison-based step-size adaptive\nrandomized search (CB-SARS). For the convergence analysis, we follow the\nmethodology developed in a companion paper for investigating linear convergence\nof CB-SARS: by exploiting invariance properties of the algorithm, we turn the\nstudy of global linear convergence on scaling-invariant functions into the\nstudy of the stability of an underlying normalized Markov chain (MC). We hence\nprove global linear convergence by studying the stability (irreducibility,\nrecurrence, positivity, geometric ergodicity) of the normalized MC associated\nto the $(1+1)$-ES. More precisely, we prove that starting from any initial\nsolution and any step-size, linear convergence with probability one and in\nexpectation occurs. Our proof holds on unimodal functions that are the\ncomposite of strictly increasing functions by positively homogeneous functions\nwith degree $\\alpha$ (assumed also to be continuously differentiable). This\nfunction class includes composite of norm functions but also non-quasi convex\nfunctions. Because of the composition by a strictly increasing function, it\nincludes non continuous functions. We find that a sufficient condition for\nglobal linear convergence is the step-size increase on linear functions, a\ncondition typically satisfied for standard parameter choices. While introduced\nmore than 40 years ago, we provide here the first proof of global linear\nconvergence for the $(1+1)$-ES with generalized one-fifth success rule and the\nfirst proof of linear convergence for a CB-SARS on such a class of functions\nthat includes non-quasi convex and non-continuous functions. Our proof also\nholds on functions where linear convergence of some CB-SARS was previously\nproven, namely convex-quadratic functions (including the well-know sphere\nfunction).\n"]}]

Seymour proved that every such graph has a nowhere-zero\n6-flow.\n  For a graph embedded in an orientable surface of higher genus, flows are not\ndual to colourings, but to local-tensions. By Seymour's theorem, every graph on\nan orientable surface without the obvious obstruction has a nowhere-zero\n6-local-tension. Bouchet conjectured that the same should hold true on\nnon-orientable surfaces. Equivalently, Bouchet conjectured that every\nbidirected graph with a nowhere-zero $\\mathbb{Z}$-flow has a nowhere-zero\n6-flow. Our main result establishes that every such graph has a nowhere-zero\n12-flow.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 2 figures"]}]

It\ncouples a superflow of the phase of the quark condensate to the Chern-Simons\ncurrent. The usual $\\theta$-parameter is replaced by the phase of the quark\ncondensate, which becomes nontrivial due to the existence of topological\ndefects such as vortices. This new formulation can address the U(1) problem in\na similar way as in the $\\theta$-world and may avoid the strong CP problem as\nthe new topological charge term is a derivative coupling. Some phenomenological\napplications like chiral magnetic effects and possible connections to the\nJosephson effect are discussed.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure"]}]

We\nattempted to identify clues to the microscopic origin of the valence band spin\nanisotropy and to the mechanisms which actually determine the linear\npolarization of the PL in the quantum wells subject to the in-plane magnetic\nfield. The conclusions of the present paper apply in full measure to\nnon-magnetic QWs as well as ensembles of disk-like QDs with shape and/or strain\nanisotropy.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures"]}]
