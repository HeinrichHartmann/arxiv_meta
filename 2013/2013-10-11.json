We\nfind that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the\nobserved photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a\nluminosity of log (L/Lsun)~5.55, surface temperature ~45000 K, and mass of\n~10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model\noverestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could likely\nbe reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50\nMsun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. Our models indicate a very uncertain\nejecta mass of ~8 Msun, which is higher than the average of the SN Ib ejecta\nmass that is derived from the lightcurve (2-4 Msun). This possibly high ejecta\nmass could produce detectable effects in the iPTF13bvn lightcurve and spectrum.\nIf the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest\nthat stars with relatively high initial masses (>30 Msun) can produce visible\nSN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Examples include solid\nelectrolytes that conduct current through the motion of charged point defects,\nand complex oxide ferroelectrics that display multifunctionality through the\nmotion of domain wall defects. Therefore, it is important to understand the\nstructure of defects and their response to electrical and mechanical fields. A\ncentral hurdle, however, is that interactions in ionic solids include both\nshort-range atomic interactions as well as long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. Existing atomistic-to-continuum multi-scale methods, such as the\nQuasicontinuum method, are applicable only when the atomic interactions are\nshort-range. In addition, empirical reductions of quantum mechanics to density\nfunctional models are unable to capture key phenomena of interest in these\nmaterials. To address this open problem, we develop a multiscale atomistic\nmethod to coarse-grain the long-range electrical interactions in ionic crystals\nwith defects. In these settings, the charge density is rapidly varying, but in\nan almost-periodic manner. The key idea is to use the polarization density\nfield as a multiscale mediator that enables efficient coarse-graining by\nexploiting the almost-periodic nature of the variation. In regions far from the\ndefect, where the crystal is close-to-perfect, the polarization field serves as\na proxy that enables us to avoid accounting for the details of the charge\nvariation.

In both models, the\ndischarging flow-rate is determined by a recently developed model of capacity\ndrop, and the upstream in-flux is regulated by the speed limit in the VSL zone.\nSince the link queue model approximates the LWR model and is much simpler, we\nfirst analyze the control problem and develop effective VSL strategies based on\nthe former. First for an open-loop control system with a constant speed limit,\nwe prove that a constant speed limit can introduce an uncongested equilibrium\nstate, in addition to a congested one with capacity drop, but the congested\nequilibrium state is always exponentially stable. Then we apply a feedback\nproportional-integral (PI) controller to form a closed-loop control system, in\nwhich the congested equilibrium state and, therefore, capacity drop can be\nremoved by the I-controller. Both analytical and numerical results show that,\nwith appropriately chosen controller parameters, the closed-loop control system\nis stable, effect, and robust. Finally, we show that the VSL strategies based\non I- and PI-controllers are also stable, effective, and robust for the LWR\nmodel. Since the properties of the control system are transferable between the\ntwo models, we establish a dual approach for studying the control problems of\nnonlinear traffic flow systems. We also confirm that the VSL strategy is\neffective only if capacity drop occurs. The obtained method and insights can be\nuseful for future studies on other traffic control methods and implementations\nof VSL strategies.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 14 figures"]}]

Since\na single statistical estimator can hardly be suitable to detect the various\npossible forms of non-Gaussianity, it is important to employ different\nstatistical indicators to study non-Gaussianity of CMB. This has motivated the\nproposal of a number statistical tools, including two large-angle indicators\nbased on skewness and kurtosis of spherical caps of CMB sky-sphere. Although\nsuitable to detect fairly large non-Gaussianity they are unable to detect\nnon-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds, and exhibit power spectra with\nundesirable oscillation pattern. Here we use several thousands simulated CMB\nmaps to examine interrelated problems regarding advances of these spherical\npatches procedures. We examine whether a change in the choice of the patches\ncould enhance the sensitivity of the procedures well enough to detect\nlarge-angle non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds. To this end, a new\nstatistical procedure with non-overlapping cells is proposed and its capability\nis established. We also study whether this new procedure is capable to smooth\nout the undesirable oscillation pattern in the skewness and kurtosis power\nspectra of the spherical caps procedure. We show that the new procedure solves\nthis problem, making clear this unexpected power spectra pattern does not have\na physical origin, but rather presumably arises from the overlapping obtained\nwith the spherical caps approach.

However, the resulting learning problems are usually hard\nto solve because of the non-smoothness of the margin loss. Existing approaches\nto building max-margin supervised topic models rely on an iterative procedure\nto solve multiple latent SVM subproblems with additional mean-field assumptions\non the desired posterior distributions.

Namely, we present Gibbs max-margin\nsupervised topic models, a latent variable Gibbs classifier to discover hidden\ntopic representations for various tasks, including classification, regression\nand multi-task learning. Gibbs max-margin supervised topic models minimize an\nexpected margin loss, which is an upper bound of the existing margin loss\nderived from an expected prediction rule.

This paper considers two network models\nreflecting both the broadcast and superposition properties of wireless\nchannels: the collocated linear finite field network and the collocated\nGaussian network. A general multi-round coding scheme exploiting not only the\nbroadcast property but particularly also the superposition property of the\nnetworks is developed. Through careful scheduling of concurrent transmissions\nto reduce redundancy, it is shown that given any independent measurement\ndistribution, all type-threshold functions can be computed reliably with a\nnon-vanishing rate in the collocated Gaussian network, even if the number of\nsensors tends to infinity.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory"]}]

In this paper we study the\nSchur-positivity of a family of symmetric functions. Given a partition \\lambda,\nwe denote by \\lambda^c its complement in a square partition (m^m). We\nconjecture a Schur-positivity criterion for symmetric functions of the form\ns_{\\mu'}s_{\\mu^c}-s_{\\lambda'}s_{\\lambda^c}, where \\lambda is a partition of\nweight |\\mu|-1 contained in \\mu and the complement of \\mu is taken in the same\nsquare partition as the complement of \\lambda. We prove the conjecture in many\ncases.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 16 figures"]}]

Owing to this\nphenomenon,light diffracts out in all directions when it passes through a\nsubwavelength slit.This imposes a fundamental limit on the transverse size of a\nlight beam at a given distance from the aperture. We show that a\nsubwavelength-sized beam propagating without diffractive broadening can be\nproduced in free space by the constructive interference of multiple beams of a\nFresnel source of the respective high-refraction-index waveguide. Moreover, it\nis shown that such a source can be constructed not only for continuous waves,\nbut also for ultra-short (near single-cycle) pulses. The results theoretically\ndemonstrate the feasibility of completely diffraction-free subwavelength-beam\noptics, for both continuous waves and ultra-short pulses. The approach extends\noperation of the near-field subwavelength-beam optics, such as near-field\nscanning optical microscopy and spectroscopy,to the \"not-too-distant\" field\nregime (0.5 to about 10 wavelengths).\n","Comment: 4 figures"]}]

The amplitude distributions of the diffracted wave-packets having\nthe central wavelengths in the visible spectral region are found by using the\nNeerhoff and Mur coupled integral equations, which are solved numerically for\neach Fourier's component of the wave-packet. In the case of fs pulses, the\nduration and transverse dimensions of the diffracted pulse remain practically\nthe same as that of the input pulse. This demonstrates feasibility of the NSOM\nin which a fs pulse is used to provide the fs temporal resolution together with\nnm-scale spatial resolution. In the sub-fs domain, the Fourier spectrum of the\ntransmitted pulse experiences a considerable narrowing that leads to the\nincrease of the pulse duration in a few times. This imposes a limit on the\nsimultaneous resolutions in time and space.\n","Comment: 5 figures"]}]
