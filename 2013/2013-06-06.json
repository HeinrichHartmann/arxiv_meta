The objective is to maximize the\nlong-term sum of utilities across the video terminals in a decentralized\nfashion, by jointly optimizing the packet scheduling, the resource allocation,\nand the cooperation decisions, under the assumption that some nodes are willing\nto act as cooperative relays. A pricing-based distributed resource allocation\nframework is adopted, where the price reflects the expected future congestion\nin the network. Specifically, we formulate the wireless video transmission\nproblem as an MU Markov decision process (MDP) that explicitly considers the\ncooperation at the physical layer and the medium access control sublayer, the\nvideo users' heterogeneous traffic characteristics, the dynamically varying\nnetwork conditions, and the coupling among the users' transmission strategies\nacross time due to the shared wireless resource. Although MDPs notoriously\nsuffer from the curse of dimensionality, our study shows that, with appropriate\nsimplications and approximations, the complexity of the MU-MDP can be\nsignificantly mitigated. Our simulation results demonstrate that integrating\ncooperative decisions into the MU-MDP optimization can increase the resource\nprice in networks that only support low transmission rates and can decrease the\nprice in networks that support high transmission rates. Additionally, our\nresults show that cooperation allows users with feeble direct signals to\nachieve improvements in video quality on the order of 5-10 dB peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), with less than 0.8 dB quality loss by users with\nstrong direct signals, and with a moderate increase in total network energy\nconsumption that is significantly less than the energy that a distant node\nwould require to achieve an equivalent PSNR without exploiting cooperative\ndiversity.\n"]}]

We assume that each of the\nprocessors are Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) enabled such that they\ncan independently trade off performance for power, while taking the video\ndecoding workload into account. In the past, scheduling and DVFS policies in\nmulti-core systems have been formulated heuristically due to the inherent\ncomplexity of the on-line multicore scheduling problem. The key contribution of\nthis report is that we rigorously formulate the problem as a Markov decision\nprocess (MDP), which simultaneously takes into account the on-line scheduling\nand per-core DVFS capabilities; the power consumption of the processor cores\nand caches; and the loss tolerant and dynamic nature of the video decoder's\ntraffic. In particular, we model the video traffic using a Direct Acyclic Graph\n(DAG) to capture the precedence constraints among frames in a Group of Pictures\n(GOP) structure, while also accounting for the fact that frames have different\ndisplay/decoding deadlines and non-deterministic decoding complexities. The\nobjective of the MDP is to minimize long-term power consumption subject to a\nminimum Quality of Service (QoS) constraint related to the decoder's\nthroughput. Although MDPs notoriously suffer from the curse of dimensionality,\nwe show that, with appropriate simplifications and approximations, the\ncomplexity of the MDP can be mitigated. We implement a slice-parallel version\nof H.264 on a multiprocessor ARM (MPARM) virtual platform simulator, which\nprovides cycle-accurate and bus signal-accurate simulation for different\nprocessors.

We calculated more than 3000 stellar tracks and\nisochrones, with updated solar mixture, by changing the following physical\ninputs within their current range of uncertainty: 1H(p,nu e+)2H,\n14N(p,gamma)15O, and triple-alpha reaction rates, radiative and conductive\nopacities, neutrino energy losses, and microscopic diffusion velocities. We\nperformed a systematic variation on a fixed grid, in a way to obtain a full\ncrossing of the perturbed input values. The effect of the variations of the\nchosen physical inputs on relevant stellar evolutionary features, such as the\nturn-off luminosity, the central hydrogen exhaustion time, the red-giant branch\n(RGB) tip luminosity, the helium core mass, and the ZAHB luminosity in the RR\nLyrae region are statistically analyzed. For a 0.9 Msun model, the cumulative\nuncertainty on the turn-off, the RGB tip, and the ZAHB luminosities accounts\nfor $\\pm$ 0.02 dex, $\\pm$ 0.03 dex, and $\\pm$ 0.045 dex respectively, while the\ncentral hydrogen exhaustion time varies of about $\\pm$ 0.7 Gyr. The most\nrelevant effect is due to the radiative opacities uncertainty; for the later\nevolutionary stages the second most important effect is due to the triple-alpha\nreaction rate uncertainty. For an isochrone of 12 Gyr, we find that the\nisochrone turn-off log luminosity varies of $\\pm$ 0.013 dex, the mass at the\nisochrone turn-off varies of $\\pm$ 0.015 Msun, and the difference between ZAHB\nand turn-off log-luminosity varies of $\\pm$ 0.05 dex. The effect of the\nphysical uncertainty affecting the age inferred from turn-off luminosity and\nfrom the vertical method are of $\\pm$ 0.375 Gyr and $\\pm$ 1.25 Gyr\nrespectively.\n","Comment: Accepteted for pubblication in A&A.

More\nspecifically, we address systems where the Gaussian approximation fails, i.e.\nthe sole knowledge of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of\nquantum correlations. We thus investigate the dynamics for two different\nconfigurations of the environment: in the first case the noise spectrum is due\nto the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an\nundetermined switching rate, whereas in the second case we consider a\ncollection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching rates. In both cases\nwe found analytical expressions for the time dependence of entanglement and\nquantum discord, which may be also extended to a collection of flcutuators with\nrandom switching rates. The environmental noise is introduced by means of\nstochastic time-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian and this allows us to\ndescribe the effects of both separate and common environments. We show that the\nnon-Gaussian character of the noise may lead to significant effects, e.g.\nenvironments with the same power spectrum, but different configurations, give\nraise to opposite behavior for the quantum correlations. In particular,\ndepending on the characteristics of the environmental noise considered, both\nentanglement and discord display either a monotonic decay or the phenomena of\nsudden death and revivals.

Can we still rely on conventional economic\nthinking or do we need a new approach?\n  I argue that, as the complexity of socio-economic systems increases,\nnetworked decision-making and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more\nimportant features. It will be explained why, besides the \"homo economicus\"\nwith strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a\n\"homo socialis\" with other-regarding preferences. While the \"homo economicus\"\noptimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the \"homo socialis\"\nare self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by\nthe term \"networked minds\". Notably, the \"homo socialis\" manages to earn higher\npayoffs than the \"homo economicus\".\n  I show that the \"homo economicus\" and the \"homo socialis\" imply a different\nkind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the\ntraditional economics for the \"homo economicus\" (\"economics 1.0\"), a\ncomplementary theory must be developed for the \"homo socialis\". This economic\ntheory might be called \"economics 2.0\" or \"socionomics\".

To thrive, the \"homo socialis\"\nrequires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation\nsystems, which will be sketched in this paper.

Aims.\nThis paper explores a newly identified effect in spectro-interferometric phase\nthat can be used for probing the inner regions of gaseous edge-on disks on a\nscale of a few stellar radii. Methods. The origin of this effect (dubbed\ncentral quasi-emission phase signature, CQE-PS) lies in the velocity-dependent\nline absorption of photospheric radiation by the circumstellar disk. At high\nspectral and marginal interferometric resolution, photocenter displacements\nbetween star and isovelocity regions in the Keplerian disk reveal themselves\nthrough small interferometric phase shifts. To investigate the diagnostic\npotential of this effect, a series of models are presented, based on detailed\nradiative transfer calculations in a viscous decretion disk. Results. Amplitude\nand detailed shape of the CQE-PS depend sensitively on disk density and size\nand on the radial distribution of the material with characteristic shapes in\ndifferential phase diagrams. In addition, useful lower limits to the angular\nsize of the central stars can be derived even when the system is almost\nunresolved. Conclusions.

The present objective is to\ndevelop such a model, usable in finite element programs. The comminution at\nvery high strain rates can dissipate a large portion of the kinetic energy of\nan impacting missile. The spatial derivative of the energy dissipated by\ncomminution gives a force resisting the penetration, which is superposed on the\nnodal forces obtained from the static constitutive model in a finite element\nprogram. The present theory is inspired partly by Grady's model for comminution\ndue to explosion inside a hollow sphere, and partly by analogy with turbulence.\nIn high velocity turbulent flow, the energy dissipation rate is enhanced by the\nformation of micro-vortices (eddies) which dissipate energy by viscous shear\nstress. Similarly, here it is assumed that the energy dissipation at fast\ndeformation of a confined solid gets enhanced by the release of kinetic energy\nof the motion associated with a high-rate shear strain of forming particles.\nFor simplicity, the shape of these particles in the plane of maximum shear rate\nis considered to be regular hexagons. The rate of release of free energy\ndensity consisting of the sum of this energy and the fracture energy of the\ninterface between the forming particle is minimized. The particle sizes are\nassumed to be distributed according to Schuhmann's power law. It is concluded\nthat the minimum particle size is inversely proportional to the (2/3)-power of\nthe shear strain rate, that the kinetic energy release is to proportional to\nthe (2/3)-power, and that the dynamic comminution creates an apparent material\nviscosity inversely proportional to the (1/3)-power of the shear strain rate.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The design of each\nprotocol follows certain goals i.e. reduction of energy consumption,\nimprovement of communication latency, achievement of robustness and scalability\netc. This paper examines the main approaches and challenges in the design and\nimplementation of underwater sensor networks.
