We distinguish two models. For the first one, we do not take into\naccount the influence of Intra-Group Matter (IGrM). In this case we demonstrate\nthat for currently known parameters of this system the collision is hardly\nplausible because of the angular momentum. These galaxies will approach the\nminimum distance of about 290 Kpc in 4.44 Gyr from present and then begin to\nrun away irreversibly from each other.

Therefore, for the IGrM particles with masses\nless than 17 MeV the merger becomes problematic.

For\nsuch processes the zero-acceleration surface (where gravitational attraction is\nbalanced by cosmological accelerated expansion) plays the crucial role. We show\nthat such surface is absent for the Local Group. Instead, we find two points\nand one circle with zero acceleration.

A degradation of the focus sharpness arises in general from\ngeometrical deformations and surface roughness, the former usually described by\ngeometrical optics and the latter by physical optics. In general, technological\ndevelopments are aimed at a very tight focusing, which requires the mirror\nprofile to comply with the nominal shape as much as possible and to keep the\nroughness at a negligible level. However, a deliberate deformation of the\nmirror can be made to endow the focus with a desired size and distribution, via\npiezo actuators as done at the EIS-TIMEX beamline of FERMI@Elettra. The\nresulting profile can be characterized with a Long Trace Profilometer and\ncorrelated with the expected optical quality via a wavefront propagation code.\nHowever, if the roughness contribution can be neglected, the computation can be\nperformed via a ray-tracing routine, and, under opportune assumptions, the\nfocal spot profile (the Point Spread Function, PSF) can even be predicted\nanalytically. The advantage of this approach is that the analytical relation\ncan be reversed; i.e, from the desired PSF the required mirror profile can be\ncomputed easily, thereby avoiding the use of complex and time-consuming\nnumerical codes.

A selection of prominent methods across the categories is compared in\nterms of quantitative performance measures (shadow detection and discrimination\nrates, colour desaturation) as well as qualitative observations. Furthermore,\nwe propose the use of tracking performance as an unbiased approach for\ndetermining the practical usefulness of shadow detection methods. The\nevaluation indicates that all shadow detection approaches make different\ncontributions and all have individual strength and weaknesses. Out of the\nselected methods, the geometry-based technique has strict assumptions and is\nnot generalisable to various environments, but it is a straightforward choice\nwhen the objects of interest are easy to model and their shadows have different\norientation. The chromacity based method is the fastest to implement and run,\nbut it is sensitive to noise and less effective in low saturated scenes. The\nphysical method improves upon the accuracy of the chromacity method by adapting\nto local shadow models, but fails when the spectral properties of the objects\nare similar to that of the background. The small-region texture based method is\nespecially robust for pixels whose neighbourhood is textured, but may take\nlonger to implement and is the most computationally expensive.

Strong Nash equilibrium (SNE) refines NE\nto this setting. It is known that finding an SNE is NP-complete when the number\nof agents is constant. This hardness is solely due to the existence of\nmixed-strategy SNEs, given that the problem of enumerating all pure-strategy\nSNEs is trivially in P. Our central result is that, in order for a game to have\nat least one non-pure-strategy SNE, the agents' payoffs restricted to the\nagents' supports must, in the case of 2 agents, lie on the same line, and, in\nthe case of n agents, lie on an (n - 1)-dimensional hyperplane.
