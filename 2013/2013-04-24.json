Ecologists and social scientists have described many ways that\nindividuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this\nresearch area. First, it shows that throughflow, the total energy-matter\nentering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative\ncontribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global\nbecause it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members.\nFurther, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status as defined in social\nscience. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists\nto use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second,\nI characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic\necosystem models. Consistent with expectations, this analysis shows that a\nsmall fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the\nsystem activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes\ngenerate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer dominant\nnodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity. 121 of the\n130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary\nproducers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality\nindicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the power\nconcentration in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these\nresults are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis\nbased on economic input-output analysis. Therefore these results should be\nuseful for ecosystem ecology, industrial ecology, the study of urban\nmetabolism, as well as other domains using input-output analysis.\n","Comment: 7 figures, 2 tables"]}]

Simultaneously,\nCP-violation from a complex phase in the wino-higgsino sector can account for\nthe observed baryon asymmetry through resonant sources at the electroweak phase\ntransition, while satisfying current constraints from dark matter, collider,\nand electric dipole moment (EDM) experiments. This result is possible by virtue\nof a relatively light pseudoscalar Higgs sector with a small degree of mixing,\nwhich yields efficient s-channel resonant neutralino annihilation consistent\nwith indirect detection constraints, and of the moderate values of $\\mu$\nrequired to obtain a bino-like LSP consistent with the line.

Instead, sex is\nwidespread and it is clonal species that face early obsolescence. One possible\nreason is that sex is an adaptation to resist ubiquitous parasites, which\nevolve rapidly and potentially antagonistically. We use a heuristic approach to\nmodel mutation-selection in finite populations where a parasitic haploid mounts\na negative frequency-dependent attack on a diploid host. The host evolves\nreflexively to reduce parasitic load. Both host and parasite populations\ngenerate novel alleles by mutation and have access to large allele spaces. Sex\noutcompetes cloning by two overlapping mechanisms. First, sexual diploids adopt\nadvantageous homozygous mutations more rapidly than clonal diploids under\nconditions of lag load. This rate advantage can offset the lesser fecundity of\nsex. Second, a relative advantage to sex emerges under host mutation rates that\nare fast enough to retain fitness in a rapidly mutating parasite environment\nand increase host polymorphism. Clonal polymorphic populations\ndisproportionately experience interference with selection at high mutation\nrates, both between and within loci. This slows clonal population adaptation to\na changing parasite environment and reduces clonal population fitness relative\nto sex. The interference increases markedly with the number of loci under\nindependent selection. Rates of parasite mutation exist that not only allow sex\nto survive despite the two-fold cost of males but which enable sexual and\nclonal populations to have equal fitness and co-exist.

Finally, a global reconstruction of sea level and a reconstruction of\nthe North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index are analyzed and compared: both\nsequences cover about three centuries from 1700 to 2000. The proposed\nmethodology quickly highlights oscillations and teleconnections among the\nrecords at the decadal and multidecadal scales. At the secular time scales tide\ngauge records present relatively small (positive or negative) accelerations, as\nfound in other studies. On the contrary, from the decadal to the secular scales\n(up to 110-year intervals) the tide gauge accelerations oscillate significantly\nfrom positive to negative values mostly following the PDO, AMO and NAO\noscillations. In particular, the influence of a large quasi 60-70 year natural\noscillation is clearly demonstrated in these records.

First of all, a denoising process must be applied on the grey scale\nimage using median filter to identify pixels which are likely to be\ncontaminated by noise. The benefit of this step is to smooth the image and get\nrid of the noisy pixels. After that, the simple statistical standard deviation\ncould be computed for each 2X2 window size. If the value of the standard\ndeviation inside the 2X2 window size is greater than a predefined threshold,\nthen the upper left pixel in the 2?2 window represents an edge. The visual\ndifferences between the proposed edge detector and the standard known edge\ndetectors have been shown to support the contribution in this paper.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 table, 6 figures"]}]

Several frequently computed metrics like the clustering\ncoefficient and the transitivity ratio need to count the number of triangles in\nthe network. Furthermore, triangles are one of the most important graph classes\nconsidered in network mining. In this paper, we present a new randomized\nalgorithm for approximate triangle counting. The algorithm can be adopted with\ndifferent sampling methods and give effective triangle counting methods. In\nparticular, we present two sampling methods, called the \\textit{$q$-optimal\nsampling} and the \\textit{edge sampling}, which respectively give $O(sm)$ and\n$O(sn)$ time algorithms with nice error bounds ($m$ and $n$ are respectively\nthe number of edges and vertices in the graph and $s$ is the number of\nsamples). Among others, we show, for example, that if an upper bound\n$\\widetilde{\\Delta^e}$ is known for the number of triangles incident to every\nedge, the proposed method provides an $1\\pm \\epsilon$ approximation which runs\nin $O( \\frac{\\widetilde{\\Delta^e} n \\log n}{\\widehat{\\Delta^e} \\epsilon^2} )$\ntime, where $\\widehat{\\Delta^e}$ is the average number of triangles incident to\nan edge.

This deluge of data has the potential to revolutionize the\ncomputational efforts aimed at simulating scenarios and designing containment\nstrategies. However, the integration of detailed data sources yields models\nthat are less transparent and general. Hence, given a specific disease model,\nit is crucial to assess which representations of the raw data strike the best\nbalance between simplicity and detail. We consider high-resolution data on the\nface-to-face interactions of individuals in a hospital ward, obtained by using\nwearable proximity sensors. We simulate the spread of a disease in this\ncommunity by using an SEIR model on top of different mathematical\nrepresentations of the contact patterns. We show that a contact matrix that\nonly contains average contact durations fails to reproduce the size of the\nepidemic obtained with the high-resolution contact data and also to identify\nthe most at-risk classes. We introduce a contact matrix of probability\ndistributions that takes into account the heterogeneity of contact durations\nbetween (and within) classes of individuals, and we show that this\nrepresentation yields a good approximation of the epidemic spreading properties\nobtained by using the high-resolution data. Our results mark a step towards the\ndefinition of synopses of high-resolution dynamic contact networks, providing a\ncompact representation of contact patterns that can correctly inform\ncomputational models designed to discover risk groups and evaluate containment\npolicies.
