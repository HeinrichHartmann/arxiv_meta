Interest in this\nproblem stems from its relationship to the non-linear stability of the black\nhole spacetimes themselves as solutions to the Einstein equations, one of the\ncentral open problems of general relativity. After an introductory discussion\nof the Schwarzschild geometry and the black hole concept, the classical theorem\nof Kay and Wald on the boundedness of scalar waves on the exterior region of\nSchwarzschild is reviewed. The original proof is presented, followed by a new\nmore robust proof of a stronger boundedness statement. The problem of decay of\nscalar waves on Schwarzschild is then addressed, and a theorem proving\nquantitative decay is stated and its proof sketched. This decay statement is\ncarefully contrasted with the type of statements derived heuristically in the\nphysics literature for the asymptotic tails of individual spherical harmonics.\nFollowing this, our recent proof of the boundedness of solutions to the wave\nequation on axisymmetric stationary backgrounds (including slowly-rotating Kerr\nand Kerr-Newman) is reviewed and a new decay result for slowly-rotating Kerr\nspacetimes is stated and proved. This last result was announced at the summer\nschool and appears in print here for the first time. A discussion of the\nanalogue of these problems for spacetimes with a positive cosmological constant\nfollows.

We show that the base capacity is deterministic and it is identified\nwith the free boundary of the associated optimal stopping problem, when the\ncoefficients of the controlled diffusion are deterministic functions of time.\nThis is a novelty in the literature on finite horizon singular stochastic\ncontrol problems. As a subproduct this result allows us to obtain an integral\nequation for the free boundary, which we explicitly solve in the infinite\nhorizon case for a Cobb-Douglas production function and constant coefficients\nin the controlled capacity process.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]

The flow is inferred from the\ndetection of a residual dipole generated by CMB fluctuations exclusively in the\ndirection of galaxy clusters, and measured within apertures containing zero\nmonopole. Consistent with this interpretation, the amplitude of the dipole\ncorrelates with the X-ray luminosity of the clusters. To enable this\nmeasurement, the CMB data need to be filtered to remove the primary CMB,\nthereby increasing the data's signal-to-noise ratio. Filtering cannot imprint a\nsignal with the mentioned properties at cluster positions; however, an\ninadequately designed filter can greatly suppress such a signal.

The discrepancies can be traced to the likely presence of\nresidual dipoles caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, to\nassumptions about cluster profiles incompatible with the data as well as\nfailure to compute dipoles at the zero monopole aperture.

Second, under certain conditions, a junction tree based UGMS\nalgorithm can produce consistent results with fewer observations than the usual\nrequirements of existing algorithms. Third, both our theoretical and\nexperimental results show that the junction tree framework does a significantly\nbetter job at finding the weakest edges in a graph than existing methods.

However, the dynamics\nand potential range of barchan morphologies emerging under each specific\nscenario that leads to dune asymmetry are far from being understood.

Asymmetric barchans migrating along a tilted surface\nmove laterally, with transverse migration velocity proportional to the slope of\nthe terrain. Limb elongation induced by topography can occur when a barchan\ncrosses a topographic rise.

Free fermion phases with this symmetry (class DIII) are indexed by an\ninteger n, of which n=1 is realized by the B-phase of superfluid Helium-3.\nPreviously it was believed that the surface must be gapless unless time\nreversal symmetry is broken.

Such objects can\nbe formed from the isocurvature (entropy) density perturbations or from the\npeaks in the spectrum of curvature (adiabatic) perturbation.

These cavities could\npossibly be created by the presence of one or more massive planets. If the gap\nis created by planets and gas is still present in it, then there should be a\nflow of gas past the planet into the inner region. It is our goal to study the\nmass accretion rate into the gap and in particular the dependency on the\nplanet's mass and the thermodynamic properties of the disk. We performed 2D\nhydro simulations for disks with embedded planets. We added radiative cooling\nfrom the disk surfaces, radiative diffusion in the disk midplane, and stellar\nirradiation to the energy equation to have more realistic models. The mass flow\nrate into the gap region depends, for given disk thermodynamics,\nnon-monotonically on the mass of the planet. Generally, more massive planets\nopen wider and deeper gaps which would tend to reduce the mass accretion into\nthe inner cavity. However, for larger mass planets the outer disk becomes\neccentric and the mass flow rate is enhanced over the low mass cases. As a\nresult, for the isothermal disks the mass flow is always comparable to the\nexpected mass flow of unperturbed disks M_d, while for more realistic radiative\ndisks the mass flow is very small for low mass planets (<= 4 M_jup) and about\n50% for larger planet masses. For the radiative disks that critical planet mass\nfor the disk to become eccentric is much larger that in the isothermal case.\nMassive embedded planets can reduce the mass flow across the gap considerably,\nto values of about an order of magnitude smaller than the standard disk\naccretion rate, and can be responsible for opening large cavities.

On average, observational data follow model predictions, but\nwith some scatter, so that systems with the same physical parameters (age,\nmetallicity, total mass) produce a variety of integrated spectra.

The issue of modelling or estimating the probability of the\nsimultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the risk\nassessment point of view. In this paper, heavy-tail modelling, widely used as a\nconservative approach to risk assessment and corresponding to a worst-case risk\nanalysis, is applied to the study of sloshing. Multivariate heavy-tailed\ndistributions are considered, with Sloshing pressures investigated by means of\nsmall-scale replica tanks instrumented with d >1 sensors. When attempting to\nfit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational\nissues inherent in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of\nthis article is to overcome this barrier by introducing a novel methodology.\nFor d-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions, the structure of extremal\ndependence is entirely characterised by the angular measure, a positive measure\non the intersection of a sphere with the positive orthant in Rd. As d\nincreases, the mutual extremal dependence between variables becomes difficult\nto assess. Based on a spectral clustering approach, we show here how a low\ndimensional approximation to the angular measure may be found. The\nnonparametric method proposed for model sloshing has been successfully applied\nto pressure data. The parsimonious representation thus obtained proves to be\nvery convenient for the simulation of multivariate heavy-tailed distributions,\nallowing for the implementation of Monte-Carlo simulation schemes in estimating\nthe probability of failure.

In research, emphasis has been put on\noperational space vehicles. Operational satellites typically have a relatively\ncompact shape, and hence, a low area-to-mass ratio (AMR), and are in most cases\nactively or passively attitude stabilized. This enables one to treat the orbit\nand attitude propagation as decoupled problems, and in many cases the attitude\ndynamics can be neglected completely. The situation is different for space\ndebris objects, which are in an uncontrolled attitude state. Furthermore, the\nassumption that a steady-state attitude motion can be averaged over data\nreduction intervals may no longer be valid. Additionally, a subset of the\ndebris objects have significantly high area-to-mass ratio values, resulting in\nhighly perturbed orbits, e.g. by solar radiation pressure, even if a stable AMR\nvalue is assumed. This assumption implies a steady-state attitude such that the\naverage cross-sectional area exposed to the sun is close to constant.\nTime-varying solar radiation pressure accelerations due to attitude variations\nwill result in un-modeled errors in the state propagation. This work\ninvestigates the evolution of the coupled attitude and orbit motion of HAMR\nobjects. Standardized pieces of multilayer insulation are simulated in near\ngeosynchronous orbits. It is assumed that the objects are rigid bodies and are\nin uncontrolled attitude states. The integrated effects of the Earth\ngravitational field and solar radiation pressure on the attitude motion are\ninvestigated.

In doing so, we go beyond the common assumption\nin distributed optimization and create additional structure that can be used to\nreduce the number of communications. This structure is captured by our\nclassification scheme, which identifies easier instances of the problem, for\nexample the standard distributed optimization problem, where all functions\ndepend on all the components of the variable.\n  In our algorithms, no central node coordinates the network, all the\ncommunications occur between neighboring nodes, and the data associated with\neach node is processed locally. We show several applications including average\nconsensus, support vector machines, network flows, and several distributed\nscenarios for compressed sensing. We also propose a new framework for\ndistributed model predictive control. Through extensive numerical experiments,\nwe show that our algorithms outperform prior distributed algorithms in terms of\ncommunication-efficiency, even some that were specifically designed for a\nparticular application.\n","Comment: Thesis defended on October 10, 2013.

Two graphs H and H' are Ramsey-equivalent if every\ngraph G is Ramsey for H if and only if it is Ramsey for H'. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of determining which graphs are Ramsey-equivalent to the\ncomplete graph K_k. A famous theorem of Nesetril and Rodl implies that any\ngraph H which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k must contain K_k. We prove that the\nonly connected graph which is Ramsey-equivalent to K_k is itself.

A graph G is Ramsey minimal for a graph\nH if it is Ramsey for H but no proper subgraph of G is Ramsey for H. Let s(H)\nbe the smallest minimum degree over all Ramsey minimal graphs for H. The study\nof s(H) was introduced by Burr, Erdos, and Lovasz, where they show that\ns(K_k)=(k-1)^2.

Moreover, since the dynamics of populations are\ndependent on the life-history of the species and its environment, it is\nconceivable that the stabilizing effects of control methods would also be\naffected by such factors, a complication that has typically not been\ninvestigated. In this study we compare six different control methods with\nrespect to their efficiency at inducing a common level of enhancement (50%\nincrease) for two kinds of stability (constancy and persistence) under four\ndifferent life history/ environment combinations. Since these methods have been\nanalytically studied elsewhere, we focus on an intuitive understanding of\nrealistic simulations incorporating noise, extinction probability and lattice\neffect. We show that for these six methods, even when the magnitude of\nstabilization attained is the same, other aspects of the dynamics like\npopulation size distribution can be very different. Consequently, correlated\naspects of stability, like the amount of persistence for a given degree of\nconstancy stability (and vice versa) or the corresponding effective population\nsize (a measure of resistance to genetic drift) vary widely among the methods.\nMoreover, the number of organisms needed to be added or removed to attain\nsimilar levels of stabilization also varies for these methods, a fact that has\neconomic implications.

Most of them assume a regular base-station\n(BS) antenna layout where the number of BS antennas is usually small. With the\ngrowing interest in cellular systems with large antenna arrays at BSs, it\nbecomes increasingly important for us to study how the BS antenna layout\naffects the rate performance when a massive number of BS antennas are employed.\n  This paper presents a comparative study of the asymptotic rate performance of\ndownlink multi-user systems with multiple BS antennas either co-located or\nuniformly distributed within a circular cell. Two representative linear\nprecoding schemes, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing\nbeamforming (ZFBF), are considered, with which the effect of BS antenna layout\non the rate performance is characterized. The analysis shows that as the number\nof BS antennas $L$ and the number of users $K$ grow infinitely while\n$L/K{\\rightarrow}\\upsilon$, the asymptotic average user rates with the\nco-located antenna (CA) layout for both MRT and ZFBF are logarithmic functions\nof the ratio $\\upsilon$. With the distributed antenna (DA) layout, in contrast,\nthe scaling behavior of the average user rate closely depends on the precoding\nschemes. With ZFBF, for instance, the average user rate grows unboundedly as\n$L, K{\\rightarrow} \\infty$ and $L/K{\\rightarrow}\\upsilon{>}1$, which indicates\nthat substantial rate gains over the CA layout can be achieved when the number\nof BS antennas $L$ is large.

We study the asymptotic distribution of Wald-type statistics for\nthe class of polynomial restrictions and show that the Wald statistic either\nhas a non-degenerate asymptotic distribution, or diverges to infinity. We\nprovide conditions for convergence and a general characterization of this\ndistribution. We provide bounds on the asymptotic distribution (when it\nexists).
