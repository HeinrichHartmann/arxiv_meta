Since the relative\nstrength and angular distribution of the many possible sources of GWs are not\nwell constrained, searches for GW signals must be performed in a\nmodel-independent way. To that end we perform two directional searches for\npersistent GWs using data from the LIGO S5 science run: one optimized for\npointlike sources and one for arbitrary extended sources. The latter result is\nthe first of its kind. Finding no evidence to support the detection of GWs, we\npresent 90% confidence level (CL) upper-limit maps of GW strain power with\ntypical values between 2-20x10^-50 strain^2 Hz^-1 and 5-35x10^-49 strain^2\nHz^-1 sr^-1 for pointlike and extended sources respectively. The limits on\npointlike sources constitute a factor of 30 improvement over the previous best\nlimits. We also set 90% CL limits on the narrow-band root-mean-square GW strain\nfrom interesting targets including Sco X-1, SN1987A and the Galactic Center as\nlow as ~7x10^-25 in the most sensitive frequency range near 160 Hz.

We find that the\nterrestrial thermal plume model needs to be modified to satisfyingly account\nfor deep turbulent plumes found in the Martian convective PBL. Our Martian\nthermal plume model qualitatively and quantitatively reproduces the thermal\nstructure of the daytime PBL on Mars: superadiabatic near-surface layer, mixing\nlayer, and overshoot region at PBL top. This model is coupled to surface layer\nparameterizations taking into account stability and turbulent gustiness to\ncalculate surface-atmosphere fluxes. Those new parameterizations for the\nsurface and mixed layers are validated against near-surface lander\nmeasurements. Using a thermal plume model moreover enables a first order\nestimation of key turbulent quantities (e.g. PBL height, convective plume\nvelocity) in Martian GCMs and MMs without having to run costly LESs.\n","Comment: 53 pages, 21 figures, paper + appendix.

This t->0+ limit appears to be unique in giving positive-definite\nBoltzmann statistics, and is identical to ring-polymer molecular dynamics\n(RPMD) TST. Here, we show that quantum TST (i.e. RPMD-TST) is exact if there is\nno recrossing (by the real-time quantum dynamics) of the ring-polymer dividing\nsurface, nor of any surface orthogonal to it in the space describing\nfluctuations in the polymer-bead positions along the reaction coordinate. In\npractice, this means that RPMD-TST gives a good approximation to the exact\nquantum rate for direct reactions, provided the temperature is not too far\nbelow the cross-over to deep tunnelling. We derive these results by comparing\nthe long-time limit of the ring-polymer flux-side time-correlation function\nwith that of a hybrid flux-side time-correlation function (containing a\nring-polymer flux operator and a Miller-Schwarz-Tromp side function), and by\nrepresenting the resulting ring-polymer momentum integrals as hypercubes.\nTogether with Part I, the results of this article validate a large number of\nRPMD calculations of reaction rates.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures.

Alternatively, the tissue from the same individuals may be pooled\nprior to sequencing in what we refer to as a biologically averaged design. As\nmathematical averaging sequences all individuals it controls for both\nbiological and technical variation; however, is the statistical resolution\ngained always worth the additional cost? To compare biological and mathematical\naveraging, we examined theoretical and empirical estimates of statistical\nefficiency and relative cost efficiency. Though less efficient at a fixed\nsample size, we found that biological averaging can be more cost efficient than\nmathematical averaging. With this motivation, we developed a differential\nexpression classifier, ICRBC, that can detect alternatively expressed genes\nbetween biologically averaged samples. In simulation studies, we found that\nbiological averaging and subsequent analysis with our classifier performed\ncomparably to existing methods, such as ASC, edgeR, and DESeq, especially when\nindividuals were pooled evenly and less than 20% of the regulome was expected\nto be differentially regulated. In two technically distinct mouse datasets and\none plant dataset, we found that our method was over 87% concordant with edgeR\nfor the 100 most significant features. We therefore conclude biological\naveraging may sufficiently control biological variation to a level that\ndifferences in gene expression may be detectable. In such situations, ICRBC can\nenable reliable exploratory analysis at a fraction of the cost, especially when\ninterest lies in the most differentially expressed loci.\n"]}]

From those closed formulas, we can\ndetermine the underlying symmetry types of the families. The one-level scaling\ndensity for the first family corresponds to the orthogonal distribution as\npredicted by the conjectures of Katz and Sarnak, and the one-level scaling\ndensity for the second family is the sum of the Dirac distribution and the even\northogonal distribution. This seems to be a new phenomenon, caused by the fact\nthat the curves of the second families have odd rank. Then, there is a trivial\nzero at the central point which accounts for the Dirac distribution, and also\naffects the remaining part of the scaling density which is then (maybe\nsurprisingly) the even orthogonal distribution. The one-level density for this\nsecond family was studied in the past for test functions with Fourier\ntransforms of small support, but since the Fourier transforms of the even\northogonal and odd orthogonal distributions are undistinguishable for small\nsupport, it was not possible to identify the distribution with those\ntechniques.

However, it can be difficult to distinguish normal\nfrom pathological HFOs, and the visual detection of HFOs is very\ntime-intensive. An automated algorithm for detecting HFOs and for wide-band\nspectral analysis is desirable.\n  Methods: The damped-oscillator oscillator detector (DOOD) is adapted for HFO\ndetection, and tested on recordings from one rat and one human. The rat data\nconsist of recordings from the hippocampus just prior to induction of status\nepilepticus, and again 6 weeks after induction, after the rat is epileptic. The\nhuman data are temporal lobe depth electrode recordings from a patient who\nunderwent pre-surgical evaluation.\n  Results: Sensitivities and positive predictive values are presented which\ndepend on specifying a threshold value for HFO detection. Wide-band\ntime-frequency and HFO-associated frequency spectra are also presented. In the\nrat data, four high frequency bands are identified at 80-250 Hz, 250-500 Hz,\n600-900 Hz and 1000-3000 Hz. The human data was low-passed filtered at 1000 Hz\nand showed HFO-associated bands at 15 Hz, 85 Hz, 400 Hz and 700 Hz.\n  Conclusion: The DOOD algorithm is capable of high resolution time-frequency\nspectra, and it can be adapted to detect HFOs with high positive predictive\nvalue. HFO-associated wide-band data show intricate low-frequency structure.\n  Significance: DOOD may ease the labor intensity of HFO detection.

This connection allows us to\nanalytically demonstrate that predictive scheduling necessarily improves system\ndelay performance and can drive it to zero with increasing prediction power.

In contrast to this intuitive derivation to the apparent\nforces, more rigorous derivation would be useful not only for the pedagogical\npurpose, but also for the applications to other kinds of rotating geophysical\nsystems rather than the fluid. The purpose of this paper is to show a general\nprocedure to derive the transformed equations in the rotating frame of\nreference based on the local Galilean transformation and rotational coordinate\ntransformation of field quantities. The generality and usefulness of this\nEulerian approach is demonstrated in the derivation of apparent forces in\nrotating fluids as well as the transformed electromagnetic field equation in\nthe rotating system.\n","Comment: Added references.
