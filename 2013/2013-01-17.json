We derive abundances under both local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) for stars spanning a large\ninterval of stellar parameters. Gravities and metallicities are also determined\nin NLTE. We confirm that the ionisation equilibrium between SrI and SrII is\nsatisfied under NLTE but not LTE, where the difference between SrI and SrII is\non average ~0.3dex. We show that the NLTE corrections are of increasing\nimportance as the metallicity decreases. For the stars with [Fe/H]>-3 the SrI\nNLTE correction is ~0.35/0.55dex in dwarfs/giants, while the Sr II NLTE\ncorrection is +/-0.05dex. On the basis of the large NLTE corrections, SrI\nshould not be applied as a chemical tracer under LTE, while it is a good tracer\nunder NLTE. SrII is a good tracer under both LTE and NLTE (down to [Fe/H]\\sim\n-3), and LTE is a safe assumption for this majority species. However, the Sr\nabundance from SrII lines is dependent on an accurate surface gravity\ndetermination, which can be obtained from NLTE spectroscopy of Fe lines or from\nparallax measurements. We could not explain the star-to-star scatter (which\nremains under both LTE and NLTE) by the use of the GCE model, since the Sr\nyields to date are too uncertain to draw firm conclusions. At least two\nproduction sites seem necessary in order to account for this large scatter\n(abridged).\n","Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures and one online table (accepted by A&A)"]}]

We show analytically that our codes are optimal\non a recently identified tradeoff between locality and minimum distance.\n  We implement our new codes in Hadoop HDFS and compare to a currently deployed\nHDFS module that uses Reed-Solomon codes. Our modified HDFS implementation\nshows a reduction of approximately 2x on the repair disk I/O and repair network\ntraffic. The disadvantage of the new coding scheme is that it requires 14% more\nstorage compared to Reed-Solomon codes, an overhead shown to be information\ntheoretically optimal to obtain locality. Because the new codes repair failures\nfaster, this provides higher reliability, which is orders of magnitude higher\ncompared to replication.\n","Comment: Technical report, paper to appear in Proceedings of VLDB, 2013"]}]

We developed a spectral emissions model that incorporates\nthe latest atomic physics data contained in the CHIANTI database in order to\nderive the composition of the torus plasma as a function of radial distance.\nElectron temperatures derived from the UVIS torus spectra are generally less\nthan those observed during the Voyager era. We find the torus ion composition\nderived from the UVIS spectra to be significantly different from the\ncomposition during the Voyager era.

The derived value of the kappa\nparameter decreases with radial distance and is consistent with the value of\n{\\kappa}=2.4 at 8 RJ derived by the Ulysses URAP instrument (Meyer-Vernet et\nal., 1995).
