In particular, it is proved that if $-A$ generates a\n$C_0$-semigroup on a Hilbert space, then for each $\\tau>0$ the operator $A$ has\na bounded calculus for the closed ideal of bounded holomorphic functions on a\n(sufficiently large) right half-plane that satisfy\n$f(z)=O(e^{-\\tau\\textrm{Re}(z)})$ as $|z|\\rightarrow \\infty$. The bound of this\ncalculus grows at most logarithmically as $\\tau\\searrow 0$. As a consequence,\n$f(A)$ is a bounded operator for each holomorphic function $f$ (on a right\nhalf-plane) with polynomial decay at $\\infty$. Then we show that each semigroup\ngenerator has a so-called (strong) $m$-bounded calculus for all\n$m\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and that this property characterizes semigroup generators.\nSimilar results are obtained if the underlying Banach space is a UMD space.\nUpon restriction to so-called $\\gamma$-bounded semigroups, the Hilbert space\nresults actually hold in general Banach spaces.\n","Comment: 25 pages, updated version.

The power of new sequencing methods now makes it possible to\nreinvigorate Medaka genetics, in particular by establishing a near-isogenic\npanel derived from a single wild population. Results Here we characterise the\ngenomes of wild Medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese\npopulation in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic\npanel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental\npopulation structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties\nsuitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric\ntraits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will\nbe feasible in the panel. In addition high throughput genome sequencing of\nthese Medaka strains confirms their evolutionary relationships on lines of\ngeographic separation and provides further evidence that there has been little\nsignificant interbreeding between the Southern and Northern Medaka population\nsince the Southern/Northern population split. The sequence data suggest that\nthe Southern Japanese Medaka existed as a larger older population which went\nthrough a relatively recent bottleneck around 10,000 years ago. In addition we\ndetect patterns of recent positive selection in the Southern population.\nConclusions These data indicate that the genetic structure of the Kiyosu Medaka\nsamples are suitable for the establishment of a vertebrate near isogenic panel\nand therefore inbreeding of 200 lines based on this population has commenced.\nProgress of this project can be tracked at\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/birney-srv/medaka-ref-panel\n","Comment: 5 figures, 30 pages"]}]

In spite of\nthese efforts several aspects of its phase diagram remain unexplained. Here we\nuse atomistic simulations to characterize the polymorphic phase diagram of Cu\nprecipitates in body-centered cubic (BCC) Fe and establish a consistent link\nbetween their thermodynamic and mechanical properties in terms of thermal\nstability, shape, and strength. The size at which Cu precipitates transform\nfrom BCC to a close-packed 9R structure is found to be strongly temperature\ndependent, ranging from approximately 4 nm in diameter (~2,700 atoms) at 200 K\nto about 8 nm (~22,800 atoms) at 700 K. These numbers are in very good\nagreement with the interpretation of experimental data given Monzen et al.\n[Phil. Mag. A 80, 711 (2000)]. The strong temperature dependence originates\nfrom the entropic stabilization of BCC Cu, which is mechanically unstable as a\nbulk phase. While at high temperatures the transition exhibits first-order\ncharacteristics, the hysteresis, and thus the nucleation barrier, vanish at\ntemperatures below approximately 300\\,K. This behavior is explained in terms of\nthe mutual cancellation of the energy differences between core and shell\n(wetting layer) regions of BCC and 9R nanoprecipitates, respectively. The\nproposed mechanism is not specific for the Fe--Cu system but could generally be\nobserved in immiscible systems, whenever the minority component is unstable in\nthe lattice structure of the host matrix.

For a certain election of the cosmological and\nGauss-Bonnet coupling constants, we derive two classes of AdS black hole\nsolutions whose horizon is planar. The first family of black holes obtained for\na particular value of the nonminimal coupling parameter only depends on a\nconstant M, and the scalar field vanishes as M=0. The second class of solutions\ncorresponds to a two-parametric (with constants M and A) black hole stealth\nconfiguration, that is a nontrivial scalar field with a black hole metric such\nthat both side (gravity and matter parts) of the Einstein equations vanishes.\nIn this case, in the vanishing M, the solution reduces to a stealth scalar\nfield on the pure AdS metric. We note that the existence of these two classes\nof solutions is inherent of the particular choice of the coupling constants\nand, they can not be promoted to spherical or hyperboloid black hole solutions\nin a standard fashion. In the last part, we add to the original action some\nexacts (D-1)-forms coupled to the scalar field. The direct benefit of\nintroducing such extra fields is to obtain black hole solutions with planar\nhorizon for arbitrary value of the nonminimal coupling parameter.\n","Comment: 7 pages.

Thus, it is interesting to see whether consideration of these two\nprinciples, separately, along with some additional physically plausible\nconstraints, can explain some interesting quantum features which are otherwise\nhard to reproduce.

Their ejecta are important for the dynamics of\nthe interstellar medium and chemical evolution models. However, ejecta\nkinematics and the characteristic scales in space and time are rather\nunexplored beyond ~10 ka.\n  Through measurement of radioactive 26Al with its decay time constant of ~10^6\nyears, we aim to trace the kinematics of massive-star and supernova ejecta over\nmillion-year time scales. Our goal is to identify the mixing time scale and the\nspatio-kinematics of such ejecta from the pc to kpc scale.\n  We use the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL and its observations along the\nGalactic ridge to trace the line shape of the 1808.63 keV gamma-ray line from\n26Al decay. We determine line centroids and compare these to Doppler shift\nexpectations from large-scale systematic rotation around the Galaxy's center,\nas observed in other Galactic objects.\n  We measure the radial velocities of gas traced by 26Al, averaged over the\nline of sight, as a function of Galactic longitude. We find substantially\nhigher velocities than expected from Galactic rotation, the average bulk\nvelocity being ~200 km s^-1 larger than the Galactic-rotation prediction. The\nobserved radial velocity spread implies a Doppler-broadening of the gamma-ray\nline that is consistent with our measurements of the overall line width. We can\nreproduce the observed characteristics with 26Al sources located along the\ninner spiral arms, when we add a global blow-out into the forward direction\naway from arms, such as expected from massive stars offset towards the\nspiral-arm leading edge.

Detection of Influenza\nin its earliest stage would facilitate timely action that could reduce the\nspread of the illness. Existing systems such as CDC and EISS which try to\ncollect diagnosis data, are almost entirely manual, resulting in about two-week\ndelays for clinical data acquisition. Twitter, a popular microblogging service,\nprovides us with a perfect source for early-stage flu detection due to its\nreal- time nature.

It is known that the nonlinear optimal control problem relies on\nthe solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a\nnonlinear partial differential equation that is generally impossible to be\nsolved analytically. Even worse, most of practical systems are too complicated\nto establish their accurate mathematical model. To overcome these difficulties,\nwe propose a data-based approximate policy iteration (API) method by using real\nsystem data rather than system model. Firstly, a model-free policy iteration\nalgorithm is derived for constrained optimal control problem and its\nconvergence is proved, which can learn the solution of HJB equation and optimal\ncontrol policy without requiring any knowledge of system mathematical model.\nThe implementation of the algorithm is based on the thought of actor-critic\nstructure, where actor and critic neural networks (NNs) are employed to\napproximate the control policy and cost function, respectively. To update the\nweights of actor and critic NNs, a least-square approach is developed based on\nthe method of weighted residuals. The whole data-based API method includes two\nparts, where the first part is implemented online to collect real system\ninformation, and the second part is conducting offline policy iteration to\nlearn the solution of HJB equation and the control policy. Then, the data-based\nAPI algorithm is simplified for solving unconstrained optimal control problem\nof nonlinear and linear systems. Finally, we test the efficiency of the\ndata-based API control design method on a simple nonlinear system, and further\napply it to a rotational/translational actuator system.
