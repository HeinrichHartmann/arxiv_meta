Although indices may be numbers, many are constructed based on\nprocedures that are highly qualitative in nature, thus limiting the\nquantitative rigour of the practical interpretations made from these indices.\nThe statistical modelling approach to construct the latent health factor index\n(LHFI) was recently developed to express ecological data, collected to\nconstruct conventional multimetric health indices, in a rigorous quantitative\nmodel that integrates qualitative features of ecosystem health and preconceived\necological relationships among such features.

We propose an improved formalism free from the\ndouble-counting of electron correlation in the low-energy degrees of freedom.\nIn this approach, the exchange-correlation energy in the local density\napproximation (LDA) is replaced with the constrained self-energy corrections\ndefined by the sum of the contribution from eliminated high-energy degrees of\nfreedom, Sigma H and that from the frequency-dependent part of the partially\nscreened interaction, Delta Sigma L. We apply the formalism to SrVO3 as well as\nto two iron-based superconductors, FeSe and FeTe. The resultant bandwidths of\nthe effective models are nearly the same as those of the previous downfolding\nformalism because of striking cancellations of Sigma H and Delta Sigma L. In\nSrVO3, the resultant bandwidth of the effective low-energy model is 2.56 eV (in\ncomparison to LDA: 2.58 eV, full GW approximation: 2.19 eV). However, in the\nnon-degenerate multi-band materials such as FeSe and FeTe, the momentum\ndependent self-energy effects yield substantial modifications of the band\nstructures and relative shifts of orbital-energy levels of the effective\nmodels. The FeSe model indicates a substantial downward shift of the x2-y2\norbital level, which may lead to an increase in the filling of the x2-y2\norbital above half filling. It suggests a destruction of the orbital selective\nMott phase of the x2-y2 orbital in agreement with the experimental absence of\nthe antiferromagnetic phase.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 20 figures, 12 tables; submitted to Physical Review B"]}]

However, mobile network operators face a challenge when it comes to\nspectrum refarming because 2G technologies such as Global System for Mobile\n(GSM) is still widely used for low bandwidth machine-to-machine (M2M) devices.\nM2M devices typically have long life cycles, e.g. smart meters, and it is\nexpensive to migrate these devices to newer technology since a truck roll will\ntypically be required to the site where a device is deployed. Furthermore, with\ncost of 2G modules several times less than that of LTE, even newly deployed M2M\ndevices tend to adopt 2G technology. Nevertheless, operators are keen to either\nforce their 2G M2M customers to migrate so that they can refarm the spectrum or\nset aside a portion of the 2G spectrum for continuing operating 2G and only\nrefarm the rest for LTE. In this paper we propose a novel solution to provide\nGSM connectivity within an LTE carrier through an efficient overlay by\nreserving a few physical resource blocks for GSM. With this approach, operators\ncan refarm their 2G spectrum to LTE efficiently while still providing some GSM\nconnectivity to their low data rate M2M customers. Furthermore, spectrum can be\ndynamically shared between LTE and GSM. An approach similar to that proposed in\nthis paper can also be applied for other narrow band technology overlays over\nLTE.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 14 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless\n  Communications"]}]

However, when D2D (in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project also\ncalled Long Term Evolution (LTE) Direct) communication in cellular spectrum is\nsupported, there is a need to revisit and modify the existing radio resource\nmanagement (RRM) and power control (PC) techniques to realize the potential of\nthe proximity and reuse gains and to limit the interference at the cellular\nlayer.

The mostly used methods are Euler,\nRiemann-Liouville and Caputo which are fractional order derivatives.

In fact, the obtained results demonstrated that the\nmethods given as fractional order derivatives are curve fitting methods or\ncurve approximation methods.

This suggests that rotational braking by magnetic winds\nbecomes very inefficient or ceases to work in the substellar regime. There is,\nhowever, some evidence for braking by disks during the first few Myrs in the\nevolution, similar to stars. Brown dwarf disks turn out to be scaled down\nversions of circumstellar disks, with dust settling, grain growth, and in some\ncases cleared out inner regions. The global disk properties roughly scale with\ncentral object mass. The evolutionary timescales in substellar disks are\nentirely consistent with what is found for stars, which may be challenging to\nunderstand.

The present work extends the analysis to the entire\n(r,\\sigma) parameter plane. An onion like periodic pattern is found which is\ndue to the alternating stability of symmetric and non-symmetric periodic\norbits. This periodic pattern is explained by considering non-trivial limits of\nlarge r and \\sigma. In addition to the limit which was previously analyzed by\nSparrow, we identify two more distinct asymptotic regimes in which either\n\\sigma/r or \\sigma^2/r is constant. In both limits the dynamics is\napproximately described by Airy functions whence the periodicity in parameter\nspace can be calculated analytically.
