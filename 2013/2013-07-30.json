This paper advocates spread spectrum modulation for\ninterstellar communication, motivated by robust immunity to radio-frequency\ninterference (RFI) of technological origin in the vicinity of the receiver\nwhile preserving full detection sensitivity in the presence of natural sources\nof noise. Receiver design for noise immunity alone provides no basis for\nchoosing a signal with any specific character, therefore failing to reduce\nambiguity. By adding RFI to noise immunity as a design objective, the\nconjunction of choice of signal (by the transmitter) together with optimum\ndetection for noise immunity (in the receiver) leads through simple\nprobabilistic argument to the conclusion that the signal should possess the\nstatistical properties of a burst of white noise, and also have a large\ntime-bandwidth product. Thus spread spectrum also provides an implicit\ncoordination between transmitter and receiver by reducing the ambiguity as to\nthe signal character. This strategy requires the receiver to guess the specific\nnoise-like signal, and it is contended that this is feasible if an appropriate\npseudorandom signal is generated algorithmically. For example, conceptually\nsimple algorithms like the binary expansion of common irrational numbers like\nPi are shown to be suitable. Due to its deliberately wider bandwidth, spread\nspectrum is more susceptible to dispersion and distortion in propagation\nthrough the interstellar medium, desirably reducing ambiguity in parameters\nlike bandwidth and carrier frequency.

We developed a BAC library from an Ab10 line and used the data to\ndevelop sequence-based markers, focusing on the proximal portion of the\nhaplotype that shows partial homology to normal chromosome 10. These molecular\nand additional cytological data demonstrate that two previously identified Ab10\nvariants (Ab10-I and Ab10-II) share a common origin. Dominant PCR markers were\nused with FISH to assay 160 diverse teosinte and maize landrace populations\nfrom across the Americas, resulting in the identification of a previously\nunknown but prevalent form of Ab10 (Ab10-III). We find that Ab10 occurs in at\nleast 75% of teosinte populations at a mean frequency of 15%. Ab10 was also\nfound in 13% of the maize landraces, but does not appear to be fixed in any\nwild or cultivated population.

A finite\nDNP is built up due to a competition between hyperfine (HF) spin-flip\ntransitions and another inelastic escape mechanism from the triplets, which\nblock transport. We focus on the temperature dependence of the DNP for zero\nenergy-detuning (i.e. equal electrostatic energy of one electron in each dot\nand a singlet in the right dot). Our main result is the existence of a\ntransition temperature, below which the DNP is bistable, so a hysteretic\nleakage current versus external magnetic field B appears. This is studied in\ntwo cases: (i) Close to the crossing of the three triplet energy levels near\nB=0, where spin-blockade is lifted due to the inhomogeneity of the effective\nmagnetic field from the nuclei. (ii) At higher B-fields, where the two\nspin-polarized triplets simultaneously cross two different singlet energy\nlevels. We develop simplified models leading to different transition\ntemperatures T_TT and T_ST for the crossing of the triplet levels and the\nsinglet-triplet level crossings, respectively. We find T_TT analytically to be\ngiven solely by the HF couplings, whereas T_ST depends on various parameters\nand T_ST>T_TT. The key idea behind the existence of the transition temperatures\nat zero energy-detuning is the suppression of energy absorption compared to\nemission in the inelastic HF transitions. Finally, by comparing the rate\nequation results with Monte Carlo simulations, we discuss the importance of\nhaving both HF interaction and another escape mechanism from the triplets to\ninduce a finite DNP.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 17 figures"]}]

However, while a reduced model may\nbe adjusted to match a particular dynamical regime of a multiscale process, it\nis unclear why it should respond to external perturbations in the same way as\nthe underlying multiscale process itself. In the current work, the authors\nstudy the statistical behavior of a reduced model of the linearly coupled\nmultiscale Lorenz 96 system in the vicinity of a chosen dynamical regime by\nperturbing the reduced model via a set of forcing parameters and observing the\nresponse of the reduced model to these external perturbations. Comparisons are\nmade to the response of the underlying multiscale dynamics to the same set of\nperturbations. Additionally, practical viability of linear response\napproximation via the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem is studied for the\nreduced model.\n","Comment: 20 pages"]}]

In\nparticular, electric field application decreases the transition temperature\nTAFM to antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and induces ferromagnetic (FM) phase, so\nthat at some E field larger than the critical field (Ecr), TFM becomes higher\nthan TAFM and the FM phase appears.

These algorithms work over general, i.e., not necessarily planar,\ngraphs. Instead of matchgates, the two underlying families of constraint\nfunctions are of the affine type and of the product type. These play the role\nof Kasteleyn's algorithm for counting planar perfect matchings. The new\nalgorithms are obtained by transforming a problem to one of these two families\nby holographic reductions.\n  The tractability of affine and product type constraint functions is known.\nThe real challenge is to determine when some concrete problem, expressed by its\nconstraint functions, has such a holographic reduction. We present a polynomial\ntime algorithm to decide if a given counting problem has a holographic\nalgorithm using the affine or product type constraint functions. Our algorithm\nalso finds a holographic transformation when one exists. We exhibit concrete\nproblems that can be solved by the new holographic algorithms. When the\nconstraint functions are symmetric, we further present a polynomial time\nalgorithm for the same decision and search problems, where the complexity is\nmeasured in terms of the (exponentially more) succinct presentation of\nsymmetric constraint functions.

The Fe-Cr alloys are candidate structural materials for the new\ngeneration of nuclear reactors. The surfaces of these alloys will be exposed to\nhydrogen or its isotopes in these reactors, and although hydrogen is soluble\nneither in Fe nor in Fe-Cr alloys, it is known that the adsorption energy of\nhydrogen on the surface of iron is not only exothermic but relatively large.\nThis clearly raises the question of the effect of the hydrogen adsorbed on the\nsurface of iron on the segregation behavior of chromium towards the surface of\niron. In this paper we show, on the basis of our ab initio density functional\ntheory calculations, that the presence of hydrogen on the surface of iron leads\nto a considerably reduced barrier for Cr segregation to both the topmost\nsurface layer and the subsurface layer, but the subsurface layer still controls\nthe barrier for surface segregation. This reduction in the barrier for surface\nsegregation is due to the nature of the Cr-H couple that acts in a complex and\nsynergistic manner. The presence of Cr enhances the exothermic nature of\nhydrogen adsorption that in turn leads to a reduced barrier for surface\nsegregation.

Such contradictory\nobservations suggest that the stationary states be unstable. In this study we\ndevelop a new approach to investigate the stability property of traffic flow in\nthis and other networks. Based on the observation that kinematic waves\npropagate in a circular path when only one of the two intermediate links is\ncongested, we derive a one-dimensional, discrete Poincar\\'e map in the out-flux\nat a Poincar\\'e section. We then prove that the fixed points of the Poincar\\'e\nmap correspond to stationary flow-rates on the two links. With Lyapunov's first\nmethod, we demonstrate that the Poincar\\'e map can be finite-time stable,\nasymptotically stable, or unstable. When unstable, the map is found to have\nperiodical points of period two, but no chaotic solutions.
