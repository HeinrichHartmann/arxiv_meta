The laws for\nvariation and inheritance of the parameters are also subject to CNS if\nvariation in transmission laws occurs. This is the strategy introduced by Nei\n(1967) to understand genetic transmission, through the evolutionary theory of\nmodifier genes, whose methodology is adopted here. When mechanisms of variation\nthemselves vary, they are subject to Feldman's (1972) evolutionary Reduction\nPrinciple that selection favors greater faithfulness of replication. A theorem\nof Karlin (1982) allows one to generalize this principle beyond biological\ngenetics to the unknown inheritance laws that would operate in CNS. The\nreduction principle for CNS is illustrated with a general multitype branching\nprocess model of universe creation containing competing inheritance laws. The\nmost faithful inheritance law dominates the ensemble of universes. The\nReduction Principle thus provides a mechanism to account for high fidelity of\ninheritance between universes. Moreover, it reveals that natural selection in\nthe presence of variation in inheritance mechanisms has two distinct objects:\nmaximization of both fitness and faithful inheritance. Tradeoffs between\nfitness and faithfulness open the possibility that evolved fundamental\nparameters are compromises, and not local optima to maximize universe\nproduction, in which case their local non-optimality may point to their\ninvolvement in the universe inheritance mechanisms.\n","Comment: 7 pages, no figures, 35 references. v.2: correction of typos, revised\n  and expanded prose"]}]

We give an algorithm to implement the transform. We show how\nto use the transform algorithm as a generator of a whole family of inferencing\nalgorithms for circumscription. The method is to employ the transform algorithm\nas a front end to any inferencing algorithm, e.g., one of the previously\navailable, that handles the parallel (empty) case of prioritization. Our\nalgorithms provide not just coverage of a new expressive class, but also\nalternatives to previous algorithms for implementing the previously covered\nclass (?layered?) of prioritization. In particular, we give a new\nquery-answering algorithm for prioritized cirumscription which is sound and\ncomplete for the full expressive class of unrestricted finite prioritization\npartial orders, for propositional defaults (or minimized predicates). By\ncontrast, previous algorithms required that the prioritization partial order be\nlayered, i.e., structured similar to the system of rank in the military. Our\nalgorithm enables, for the first time, the implementation of the most useful\nclass of prioritization: non-layered prioritization partial orders. Default\ninheritance, for example, typically requires non-layered prioritization to\nrepresent specificity adequately. Our algorithm enables not only the\nimplementation of default inheritance (and specificity) within prioritized\ncircumscription, but also the extension and combination of default inheritance\nwith other kinds of prioritized default reasoning, e.g.: with stratified logic\nprograms with negation-as-failure. Such logic programs are previously known to\nbe representable equivalently as layered-priority predicate circumscriptions.\nWorst-case, the transform increases the number of defaults exponentially. We\ndiscuss how inferencing is practically implementable nevertheless in two kinds\nof situations: general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults, or\nexpressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults. One such expressive\nspecial case is non-?top-heaviness? of the prioritization partial order. In\naddition to its direct implementation, the transform can also be exploited\nanalytically to generate special case algorithms, e.g., a tractable transform\nfor a class within default inheritance (detailed in another, forthcoming\npaper). We discuss other aspects of the significance of the fundamental result.\nOne can view the transform as reducing n degrees of partially ordered belief\nconfidence to just 2 degrees of confidence: for-sure and (unprioritized)\ndefault. Ordinary, parallel default reasoning, e.g., in parallel\ncircumscription or Poole's Theorist, can be viewed in these terms as reducing 2\ndegrees of confidence to just 1 degree of confidence: that of the non-monotonic\ntheory's conclusions. The expressive reduction's computational complexity\nsuggests that prioritization is valuable for its expressive conciseness, just\nas defaults are for theirs. For Reiter's Default Logic and Poole's Theorist,\nthe transform implies how to extend those formalisms so as to equip them with a\nconcept of prioritization that is exactly equivalent to that in\ncircumscription. This provides an interesting alternative to Brewka's approach\nto equipping them with prioritization-type precedence.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in\n  Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]}]
