We model the number and properties of ultracompact X-ray\nbinaries (UCXBs) in the Galactic Bulge. The objective is to learn about the\nformation of UCXBs and their evolution, such as the onset of mass transfer and\nlate-time behavior. Methods. The binary population synthesis code SeBa and\nstellar evolutionary tracks are used to model the UCXB population. The\nluminosity behavior of UCXBs is predicted using long-term X-ray observations of\nthe known UCXBs and the thermal-viscous disk instability model. Results. In our\nmodel, the majority of UCXBs initially have a helium burning star donor. In the\nabsence of a mechanism that destroys old UCXBs, we predict (0.2 - 1.9) x 10^5\nUCXBs in the Galactic Bulge, mostly at orbital periods longer than 60 min (a\nlarge number of long-period systems also follows from the observed short-period\nUCXB population).

This is one order of magnitude more\nthan the observed number of (probably) three. Conclusions. This overprediction\nof short-period UCXBs implies that fewer systems are formed, or that a\nsuper-Eddington mass transfer rate is more difficult to survive than assumed.\nThe very small number of observed long-period UCXBs with respect to\nshort-period UCXBs, the surprisingly high luminosity of the observed UCXBs with\norbital periods around 50 min, and the properties of the PSR J1719-1438 system\nall point to much faster UCXB evolution than expected from angular momentum\nloss via gravitational wave radiation alone. Old UCXBs, if they still exist,\nprobably have orbital periods longer than 2 h and have become very faint due to\neither reduced accretion or quiescence, or have become detached.

Recently, Nakariakov & Zimovets (2011) proposed a new model\nsuggesting that, in two-ribbon flares, such pulsations could be explained by\npropagating slow waves. These waves may travel obliquely to the magnetic field,\nreflect in the chromosphere and constructively interfere at a spatially\nseparate site in the corona, leading to quasi-periodic reconnection events\nprogressing along the flaring arcade. Such a slow wave regime would have\ncertain observational characteristics. We search for evidence of this\nphenomenon during a selection of two-ribbon flares observed by RHESSI, SOHO and\nTRACE; the flares of 2002 November 9, 2005 January 19 and 2005 August 22. We\nwere not able to observe a clear correlation between hard X-ray footpoint\nseparations and pulse timings during these events. Also, the motion of hard\nX-ray footpoints is shown to be continuous within the observational error,\nwhereas a discontinuous motion might be anticipated in the slow wave model.\nFinally, we find that for a preferential slow wave propagation angle of 25-28\ndegrees that is expected for the fastest waves, the velocities of the hard\nX-ray footpoints lead to estimated pulse periods and ribbon lengths\nsignificantly larger than the measured values. Hence, for the three events\nstudied, we conclude that the observational characteristics cannot be easily\nexplained via the Nakariakov & Zimovets (2011) propagating slow wave model when\nonly angles of 25-28 degrees are considered.

This paper presents a video face recognition system based on\nprobabilistic Multi-Region Histograms to characterise performance trade-offs\nin: (i) selecting a subset of faces compared to using all faces, and (ii)\ncombining information from all faces via clustering. Three face selection\nmetrics are evaluated for choosing a subset: face detection confidence, random\nsubset, and sequential selection. Experiments on the recently introduced MOBIO\ndataset indicate that the usage of all faces through clustering always\noutperformed selecting only a subset of faces. The experiments also show that\nthe face selection metric based on face detection confidence generally provides\nbetter recognition performance than random or sequential sampling. Moreover,\nthe optimal number of faces varies drastically across selection metric and\nsubsets of MOBIO.

The results also show that the recovery is robust and stable in\nthe sense that if X is equal to a sparse matrix plus a perturbation, then the\nconvex program we propose produces an approximation with accuracy proportional\nto the size of the perturbation. Unlike traditional results on sparse recovery,\nwhere the sensing matrix produces independent measurements, our sensing\noperator is highly constrained (it assumes a tensor product structure).\nTherefore, proving recovery guarantees require non-standard techniques. Indeed\nour approach relies on a novel result concerning tensor products of bipartite\ngraphs, which may be of independent interest.\n  This problem is motivated by the following application, among others.\nConsider a p\\times n data matrix D, consisting of n observations of p\nvariables. Assume that the correlation matrix X:=DD^{T} is (approximately)\nsparse in the sense that each of the p variables is significantly correlated\nwith only a few others. Our results show that these significant correlations\ncan be detected even if we have access to only a sketch of the data S=AD with A\n\\in R^{m\\times p}.\n"]}]

The main reasons for the high variation in the\nroute-kilometre costs are differences between projects as regards the ratio of\nunderground to above-ground construction, ground conditions, station spacing,\ntype of rolling stock, environmental and safety constraints and labour costs.\nWe warn, however, that the observations used to reach the conclusions are too\nfew to obtain results with statistical significance.

We first show that sequences of k-sine-skewed models are\nlocally and asymptotically normal in the vicinity of reflective symmetry.\nFollowing the Le Cam methodology, we then construct optimal (in the maximin\nsense) parametric tests for reflective symmetry, which we render\nsemi-parametric by a studentization argument.

Our new tests also allow us to re-visit the famous red wood\nants data set of Jander (1957). We further show that one of the proposed\nparametric tests can as well serve as a test for uniformity against cardioid\nalternatives; this test coincides with the famous circular Rayleigh (1919) test\nfor uniformity which is thus proved to be (also) optimal against cardioid\nalternatives.

We also\ninvestigate the influence of a low amplitude near resonant field on the period\ndoubling route. The model equations also exhibit symmetry restoring crisis with\nan exponent close to unity. The model can be adopted to explain certain results\non magnetoelastic beam and martensitic ribbon under sinusoidal driving\nconditions. In the latter case, we find interesting dynamics of a periodic one\norbit switching between two equivalent wells as a function of an ac magnetic\nfield that eventually makes a direct transition to chaos under resonant driving\ncondition.
