Using this extension, we have calculated\nanalytically the Q-fpt probability density for a class of few-site/state\ntight-binding Hamiltonian systems, e.g., a qubit, as well as for an infinite 1D\nlattice. The defining feature of such a quantum system is that the passage\nacross the boundary between a subspace (omega) and its complement (omega-bar)\nis through a unique pair of \"door-way\" sites such that the first departure from\n(arrival at) omega corresponds to the first arrival at (departure from)\nomega-bar. The Q-fpt probability density so derived remains positive over the\ntime interval in which it also normalizes to unity. These conditions of\npositivity and normalization define the physical time domain for the Q-fpt\nproblem. This time domain is found to remain finite for the few-site/state\nHamiltonian systems considered here, which is quite unlike the case for the\ndiffusive C-fpt problems.

While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum\nillumination changes, IR images introduce specific challenges of their own,\nmost notably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns,\ne.g. emotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition,\nfacial expression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images\nbecause they are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue\nfor fitting any deformable model. We describe a novel method which addresses\nthese challenges. To normalize for pose and facial expression changes we\ngenerate a synthetic frontal image of a face in a canonical, neutral facial\nexpression from an image of the face in an arbitrary pose and facial\nexpression. This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows active\nappearance model (AAM) fitting. This is the first publication which explores\nthe use of an AAM on thermal IR images; we propose a pre-processing step which\nenhances detail in thermal images, making AAM convergence faster and more\naccurate. To overcome the problem of thermal IR image sensitivity to the\npattern of facial temperature emissions we describe a representation based on\nreliable anatomical features. In contrast to previous approaches, our\nrepresentation is not binary; rather, our method accounts for the reliability\nof the extracted features.

A novel method is designed to derive the direction from the phone to the\nacoustic source by combining the velocity calculated from the subtle Doppler\nshift with the one from the inertial sensors of the phone.

If this mirror obstructs\npart of the stellar disc during the transit of an exoplanet, then this may be\ndetected by studying the shape of the transit light curve, presenting another\npotential means by which the action of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) can\nbe discerned. We model the light curves produced by exoplanets transiting a\nstar which possesses a Shkadov thruster, and show how the parameters of the\nplanet and the properties of the thruster can be disentangled. provided that\nradial velocity follow-up measurements are possible, and that other obscuring\nphenomena typical to exoplanet transit curves (such as the presence of\nstarspots or intrinsic stellar noise) do not dominate. These difficulties\naside, we estimate the a priori probability of detecting a Shkadov thruster\nduring an exoplanet transit, which even given optimistic assumptions remains\nstubbornly low. Despite this, many exoplanet transit surveys designed for\nradial velocity follow-up are on the horizon, so we argue that this remains a\nuseful serendipitous SETI technique. At worst, this technique will place an\nupper limit on the number of Class A stellar engines in the Solar\nneighbourhood; at best, this could help identify unusual transiting exoplanet\nsystems as candidates for further investigation with other SETI methods.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in the Journal of the\n  British Interplanetary Society"]}]
