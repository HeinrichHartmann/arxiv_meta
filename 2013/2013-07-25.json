Depending on the MAC parameters and physical layer\nthresholds, it is shown that the MAC performance indicators over fading\nchannels can be far from those derived under ideal channel assumptions.

Among them, one of\nthe main trends is to incorporate the built-in sensors of smartphone and to\nexploit crowdsourcing potentials. However the noisy built-in sensors and\nmulti-tasking limitation of underline OS often hinder the effectiveness of\nthese schemes. In this work, we propose a passive crowdsourcing CSI-based\nindoor localization scheme, C2 IL. Our scheme C2 IL only requires the\nlocating-device (e.g., a phone) to have a 802.11n wireless connection, and it\ndoes not rely on inertial sensors only existing in some smartphones. C2 IL is\nbuilt upon our innovative method to accurately estimate the moving distance\npurely based on 802.11n Channel State Information (CSI). Our extensive\nevaluations show that the moving distance estimation error of our scheme is\nwithin 3% of the actual moving distance regardless of varying speeds and\nenvironment. Relying on the accurate moving distance estimation as constraints,\nwe are able to construct a more accurate mapping between RSS fingerprints and\nlocation. To address the challenges of collecting fingerprints, a\ncrowdsourcing- based scheme is designed to gradually establish the mapping and\npopulate the fingerprints. In C2 IL, we design a trajectory clustering-based\nlocalization algorithm to provide precise real-time indoor localization and\ntracking. We developed and deployed a practical working system of C2 IL in a\nlarge office environment. Extensive evaluation results indicate that our scheme\nC2 IL provides accurate localization with error 2m at 80% at very complex\nindoor environment with minimal overhead.\n"]}]

We report various elastic\nproperties of short double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and the effect of dendrimer\nbinding using fully atomistic molecular dynamics and numerical simulations. In\nequilibrium at room temperature, the contour length distribution P(L) and\nend-to-end distance distribution P(R) are nearly Gaussian, the former gives an\nestimate of the stretch modulus {\\gamma}_1 of dsDNA in quantitative agreement\nwith the literature value.

When the dsDNA is compacted by positively charged dendrimer, the stretch\nmodulus stays invariant but the effective bending rigidity estimated from the\nend-to-end distance distribution decreases dramatically due to backbone charge\nneutralization of dsDNA by dendrimer. We support our observations with\nnumerical solutions of the worm-like-chain (WLC) model as well as using\nnon-equilibrium dsDNA stretching simulations.

The previous results are consolidated and\nbenchmarked with turbulence generated by regular square-mesh grids, designed to\nretain certain geometrical parameters of the fractal square grid. This\ncomparison shows that the nonequilibrium behaviour is manifested in both\nfractal square grid- and regular square-mesh grid-generated turbulence for a\ndownstream region during the turbulence decay up to the first few multiples of\nthe wake interaction distance. For one of the regular grids it is shown that\nbeyond this region there is a transition to the classical dissipation behaviour\nif the local turbulent Reynolds number is sufficiently high. A sharp conclusion\ncan thus be drawn that this behaviour is more general than initially thought\nand therefore of much greater scientific and engineering significance. The\nnonequilibrium dissipation phenomena is further investigated by experimentally\nmeasuring the terms of an inhomogeneous von Karman-Howarth-Monin equation. This\nequation is essentially a scale-by-scale energy transfer budget. From the data\nit is shown that the inhomogeneity of the turbulent flow does not tamper with\nthe nonequilibrium phenomena and that the scaling of the nonlinear energy\ntransfer, i.e. the transfer of energy to the small-scales, is out of balance\nwith the dissipation. This imbalance leads to the growth of the small-scale\nadvection to compensate for the increasing gap between the energy transferred\nand the energy dissipated. For the highest Reynolds number data it is also\nshown that the nonequilibrium dissipation scaling appears to be consistent with\nthe expectation that it is asymptotically independent of the viscosity with a\npower-law spectra with the Kolmogorov-Obukhov exponent -5/3.\n","Comment: Ph.D. thesis, Imperial College London, 2013"]}]
