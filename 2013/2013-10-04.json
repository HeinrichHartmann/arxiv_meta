Each form has three\ndegrees of freedom, and not only the exact coeffcients of third order Lovelock\nLagrangian satisfy the two forms of constraints, also the two independent cubic\nof Weyl tensor satisfy the independent constraint in six dimensions and yield\nthe dimensional dependent version identically independent of dimension. We have\nintroduced most general effective expression for a total third order type\nLagrangian with the homogeneity degree number three which includes the previous\neight terms plus new three ones among all seventeen independent terms. We have\nproceeded analogy for this combination, and have achieved relevant constraint.\nWe have shown that expressions given in literature as third Weyl invariant\ncombination in six dimensions satisfy this constraint. Thus, we suggest that\nthese constraint relations to be considered as the necessary consistency\nconditions on the numerical coeffcients that a Weyl invariant in six dimensions\nshould satisfy. We have calculated the \"classical\" trace anomaly (an approach\nthat was presented in our previous works) for introduced total third order type\nLagrangian and have achieved general expression with four degrees of freedom in\nmore than six dimensions. We have demonstrated that resulted expression\ncontains exactly relevant coeffcient of Schwinger-DeWitt proper time method\n(linked with relevant heat kernel coeffcient) in six dimensions, as a\nparticular case.

The recently suggested principle of maximum conformality (PMC)\nprovides a principle to eliminate such scale ambiguity in a step-by-step way.\nUsing the PMC, all non-conformal terms in perturbative expansion series are\nsummed into the running coupling, and one obtains a unique, scale-fixed,\nscheme-independent prediction at any finite order. In the paper, we make a\ndetailed PMC analysis for both the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections\nfor the double charmonium production process, $e^{+} + e^{-} \\to J/ \\psi\n(\\psi') + \\chi_{cJ}$ with $(J=0,1,2)$. The running behavior for the coupling\nconstant, governed by the PMC scales, are determined exactly for the specific\nprocesses. We compare our predictions with the measurements at the $B$\nfactories, BABAR and Belle, and the theoretical estimations obtained in the\nliterature. Because the non-conformal terms are different for various polarized\nand unpolarized cross sections, the PMC scales of these cross sections are\ndifferent in principle. It is found that all the PMC scales are almost\nindependent of the initial choice of renormalization scale. Thus, the large\nrenormalization scale uncertainty usually adopted in the literature up to\n$sim40%$ at the NLO level, obtained from the conventional scale setting, for\nboth the polarized and the unpolarized cross sections are greatly suppressed.\nIt is found that the charmonium production is dominated by J=0 channel.

This analysis intends to\nexplore the dependence of galaxy properties on the selection criterion adopted,\nstudy the degree of contamination due to star-forming outliers, and provide a\ncomparison between different commonly used selection criteria. We extracted\nfrom the zCOSMOS-20k catalog six different samples of passive galaxies, based\non morphology, optical colors, specific star-formation rate, a best fit to the\nobserved spectral energy distribution, and a criterion that combines\nmorphological, spectroscopic, and photometric information. The morphological\nsample has the higher percentage of contamination in colors, specific star\nformation rate and presence of emission lines, while the red & passive ETGs\nsample is the purest, with properties mostly compatible with no star formation\nactivity; however, it is also the less economic criterion in terms of\ninformation used. The best performing among the other criteria are the red SED\nand the quiescent ones, providing a percentage of contamination only slightly\nhigher than the red & passive ETGs criterion (on average of a factor of ~2) but\nwith absolute values of the properties of contaminants still compatible with a\nred, passively evolving population. We also provided two revised definitions of\nearly type galaxies based on restframe color-color and color-mass criteria,\nthat better reproduce the observed bimodalities. The analysis of the number\ndensities shows evidences of mass-assembly downsizing, with galaxies at\n10.25<log(M/Msun)<10.75 increasing their number by a factor ~2-4 from z=0.6 to\nz=0.2, by a factor ~2-3 from z=1 to z=0.2 at 10.75<log(M/Msun)<11, and by only\n~10-50% from z=1 to z=0.2 at 11<log(M/Msun)<11.5.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in A\\&A"]}]

The advantage, relative to the traditional KS decomposition, is\nthat the wavefunction part of the energy is now computed with the regular\n(fully-interacting) Hamiltonian. One potential drawback is that, because of\ndouble counting, the wavefunction used to compute the energy cannot be obtained\nby minimizing the energy expression with respect to the wavefunction\nparameters.

The quantum phase transition from a gapless Neel\nstate to a spin-gapped Peierls state is studied in the parameter space spanned\nby spatial anisotropy, inter-chain coupling strength and spin-lattice coupling\nstrength. It is found that for any finite inter-chain coupling, the transition\nto a dimerized Peierls ground state only occurs when the spin-lattice coupling\nexceeds a finite, non-zero critical value. This is in contrast to the pure 1D\nmodel (zero inter-chain coupling), where adiabatic/classical phonons lead to a\ndimerized ground state for any non-zero spin-phonon interaction. The phase\ndiagram in the parameter space shows that for a strong inter-chain coupling,\nthe relation between the inter-chain coupling and the critical value of the\nspin-phonon interaction is linear whereas for weak inter-chain coupling, this\nbehavior is found to have a natural logarithm-like relation.

The simplicity of our approach allows us\nto study ice phases at state points of the T-P plane that have been omitted in\nprevious simulations using free energy methods based on thermodynamic\nintegration.
