The discrepancy of an island is the absolute value of the number\nof red minus the number of blue points it contains. A convex partition of $S$\nis a partition of $S$ into islands with pairwise disjoint convex hulls. The\ndiscrepancy of a convex partition is the discrepancy of its island of minimum\ndiscrepancy. The coarseness of $S$ is the discrepancy of the convex partition\nof $S$ with maximum discrepancy. This concept was recently defined by Bereg et\nal. [CGTA 2013].

We\nprove that every $n$-point set $S$ can be colored such that its coarseness is\n$O(n^{1/4}\\sqrt{\\log n})$.

The uncertainty of data generated\nfrom the upper layer, the intermittence of the harvested energy, and the\nvariation of the fading channel are taken into account and described as\nindependent Markov processes. In each transmission, the transmitter decides the\ntransmission rate as well as the allocated power from the battery, and the rest\nof the required power will be supplied by the power grid. The objective is to\nfind an allocation sequence of transmission rate and battery power to minimize\nthe long-term average buffer delay under the average grid power constraint.

When X and\nP commute, this system can be gauged back into the original system of\nindependent particles.

The paper set outs the theoretical basis\nfor determining the initiation and direction of propagating cracks based on the\nconcept of configurational mechanics, consistent with Griffith's theory.\nResolution of the propagating crack by the finite element mesh is achieved by\nrestricting cracks to element faces and adapting the mesh to align it with the\npredicted crack direction. A local mesh improvement procedure is developed to\nmaximise mesh quality in order to improve both accuracy and solution robustness\nand to remove the influence of the initial mesh on the direction of propagating\ncracks. An arc-length control technique is derived to enable the dissipative\nload path to be traced. A hierarchical hp-refinement strategy is implemented in\norder to improve both the approximation of displacements and crack geometry.\nThe performance of this modelling approach is demonstrated on two numerical\nexamples that qualitatively illustrate its ability to predict complex crack\npaths. All problems are three-dimensional, including a torsion problem that\nresults in the accurate prediction of a doubly-curved crack.\n"]}]

A total of 137 stellar companions were resolved, including 64\nnew detections from the VAST survey, and the companion star fraction, projected\nseparation distribution and mass ratio distribution were measured.

It has been rapidly recognized that to achieve this task\nthese proteins should be efficient at both searching (i.e. sampling fast\nrelevant parts of DNA) and finding (i.e. recognizing the specific site). A\ntwo-mode search and variants of it have been suggested since the 70s to explain\neither a fast search or an efficient recognition. Combining these two\nproperties at a phenomenological level is however more difficult as they appear\nto have antagonist roles. To overcome this difficulty, one may simply need to\ndrop the dihcotomic view inherent to the two-mode search and look more\nthoroughly at the set of interactions between DNA-binding proteins and a given\nDNA segment either specific or non-specific.

Several sources, however, are known to\npulsate in quiescence at luminosities below the theoretical limit predicted for\nthe onset of the centrifugal barrier. The source 1A 0535+262 is one of them.\nHere we present the results of an analysis of a ~50 ks long XMM-Newton\nobservation of 1A 0535+262 in quiescence. At the time of the observation, the\nneutron star was close to apastron, and the source had remained quiet for two\norbital cycles. In spite of this, we detected a pulsed X-ray flux of ~3e-11\nerg/cm2/s . Several observed properties, including the power spectrum, remained\nsimilar to those observed in the outbursts. Particularly, we have found that\nthe frequency of the break detected in the quiescent noise power spectrum\nfollows the same correlation with flux observed when the source is in outburst.\nThis correlation has been associated with the truncation of the accretion disk\nat the magnetosphere boundary. We argue that our result, along with other\narguments previously reported in the literature, suggests that the accretion in\nquiescence also proceeds from an accretion disk around the neutron star. The\nproposed scenario consistently explains the energy of the cyclotron line\nobserved in 1A 0535+262, and the timing properties of the source including the\nspin frequency evolution within and between the outbursts, and the frequency of\nthe break in power spectrum.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Intermutation occurs in iterated, or $n$-fold,\nmonoidal categories, which were introduced in connection with $n$-fold loop\nspaces, and for which a related, but different, coherence result was obtained\npreviously by Balteanu, Fiedorowicz, Schw\\\" anzl and Vogt. The results of the\npresent paper strengthen up to a point this previous result, and show that\ntwo-fold loop spaces arise in the manner envisaged by these authors out of\ncategories of a more general kind, which are not two-fold monoidal in their\nsense. In particular, some categories with finite products and coproducts are\nsuch.\n  Coherence is proved here first for categories where for $\\wedge$ and $\\vee$\none assumes only intermutation, and next for categories where one also assumes\nnatural associativity isomorphisms. Coherence in the sense of coherence for\nsymmetric monoidal categories is proved when one assumes moreover natural\ncommutativity isomorphisms. A restricted coherence result, involving a proviso\nof the kind found in coherence for symmetric monoidal closed categories, is\nproved in the presence of two nonisomorphic unit objects. The coherence\nconditions for intermutation and for the unit objects are derived from a\nunifying principle, which roughly speaking is about preservation of categories\nwith structure by functors up to a natural transformation that is not an\nisomorphism.\n","Comment: 57 pages"]}]
