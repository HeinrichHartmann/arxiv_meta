Damping of waves in\nthe chromosphere depends strongly on wave frequency: waves with periods 10\nseconds or longer pass through the chromosphere with relatively little damping,\nhowever, for periods of 1 second or less, a substantial fraction (37%-100%) of\nwave energy entering the chromosphere is damped by ion-neutral friction in the\nmid and upper chromosphere, with electron resistivity playing some role in the\nlower chromosphere and in umbras.

In this paper, we present a novel synthetic\naperture imaging method for moving targets using a bi-static SAR system\ntransmitting ultra-narrowband continuous waveforms. Our method exploits the\nhigh Doppler resolution provided by ultra-narrowband CW signals to image both\nthe scene reflectivity and to determine the velocity of multiple moving\ntargets. Starting from the first principle, we develop a novel forward model\nbased on the temporal Doppler induced by the movement of antennas and moving\ntargets. We form the reflectivity image of the scene and estimate the motion\nparameters using a filtered-backprojection technique combined with a contrast\noptimization method. Analysis of the point spread function of our image\nformation method shows that reflectivity images are focused when the motion\nparameters are estimated correctly.

Furthermore, in order to guide the\nfrantic search for high-conductivity films of nanotube networks, we turn to the\nmicroscopic scale where we have developed a computationally efficient way for\ncalculating the ballistic transport across these networks. While the ballistic\ntransport is probably not capable of describing the observed transport\nproperties of these films, it is undoubtedly useful in establishing an upper\nvalue for their conductivity.

These algebras are versions of symplectic reflection algebras that\nonly exist in positive characteristic. They also happen to possess a\npresentation as an Ore extension over a commutative subring R, and via the\nderivation defining the extension, have interesting connections to certain\npolynomials appearing in combinatorics and related to alternating permutations\n(the Andr\\'e polynomials). We find the center of these algebras, their Verma\nmodules, their simple modules, and the Ext groups between simples. The Verma\nmodules coincide with the fibers of Mod H -->> Spec R, and Mod H turns out to\nbe the disjoint union, in the sense of Smith and Zhang, of the Verma modules.\nAs in non-defining characteristic, there are some distinctions between the t=0\nand t=1 cases. We also obtain results when G is replaced with an elementary\nabelian p-group E: in particular, we find the center and the simple modules\nwhen [x,y] is in k[E].\n"]}]
