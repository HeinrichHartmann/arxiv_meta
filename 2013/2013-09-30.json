In this work, we use event-driven molecular dynamics, combined with an\noptimized parallel tempering scheme, to study this polymer model over a wide\nrange of parameters. We examine the conditions where the helix structure is\nstable and determine how the interaction parameters of the polymer govern the\ndetails of the helix structure. The width of the square well (proportional to\nlambda) is found to control the radius of the helix, which decreases with\nincreasing well width until the polymer forms a coiled sphere for sufficiently\nlarge wells. The helices are found to be stable for only a window of molecular\nweights. If the polymer is too short, the helix will not form. If the polymer\nis too long, the helix is no longer the minimum energy structure, and other\nfolded structures will form. The size of this window is governed by the chain\nstiffness, which in this model is a function of the ratio of the monomer size\nto the bond length. Outside this window, the polymer still freezes into a\nlocked structure at low temperature, however, unless the chain is sufficiently\nstiff, this structure will not be unique and is similar to a glassy state.\n","Comment: Submitted to Physical Review E"]}]

The\nmeson-baryon (MB) channels included in the calculations are MB = pi N, eta N, K\nLambda, K Sigma, and pi pi N that has pi Delta, rho N, and sigma N resonant\ncomponents. The meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) are calculated from\nsolving a set of coupled-channels integral equations defined by an interaction\nHamiltonian consisting of (a) meson-exchange interactions v_{M'B',MB} derived\nfrom phenomenological Lagrangian, and (b) vertex interactions N* --> MB for\ndescribing the transition of a bare excited nucleon state N* to a channel MB.\nThe parameters of v_{M'B',MB} are mainly constrained by the fit to the data of\npi N --> pi N in the low energy region up to W =1.4 GeV. The bare masses of N*\nand the N* --> MB parameters are then determined in simultaneous fits to the\ndata of pi N --> pi N up to W =2.3 GeV and those of pi N --> eta N, K Lambda, K\nSigma and gamma N --> pi N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma up to W = 2.1 GeV. The\npole positions and residues of nucleon resonances are extracted by analytically\ncontinuing the meson-baryon amplitudes T_{M'B',MB}(W) to the complex Riemann\nenergy surface. From the extracted residues, we have determined the N* --> pi\nN, gamma N, eta N, K Lambda, K Sigma transition amplitudes at resonance poles.\nWe compare the resonance pole positions from our analysis with those given by\nParticle Data Group and the recent coupled-channels analyses by the Juelich and\nBonn-Gatchina groups.

Using this null result, we\nderive a constraint on a potential dipolar modulation amplitude, A(k)<0.0045 on\nthe ~10 Mpc-scale, at 95% C.L. This new constraint must be satisfied by any\ntheoretical model attempting to explain the hemispherical asymmetry at large\nangular scales.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures. v2: journal version (minor changes compared to\n  v1)"]}]

Many analytic approaches are\nbased on simplified phenomenological models in which it is difficult to capture\nmuch of the complex physics associated with this system. Conversely, numerical\napproaches reproduce this complex behaviour, but are limited in the amount of\ntheoretical insight they can provide. Using a systematic approach based on the\nspatial statistics of spin bath constituents, we develop a purely analytic\ntheory for the central spin decoherence problem of Nitrogen Vacancy centres in\ndiamond that reproduces the experimental and numerical results found in the\nliterature, whilst correcting a number of limitations and inaccuracies\nassociated with existing analytical approaches.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 16 figures"]}]

The OSCAR regularizer has a\nnon-trivial proximity operator, which limits its applicability. We reformulate\nthis regularizer as a weighted sorted L_1 norm, and propose its grouping\nproximity operator (GPO) and approximate proximity operator (APO), thus making\nstate-of-the-art proximal splitting algorithms (PSAs) available to solve\ninverse problems with OSCAR regularization. The GPO is in fact the APO followed\nby additional grouping and averaging operations, which are costly in time and\nstorage, explaining the reason why algorithms with APO are much faster than\nthat with GPO. The convergences of PSAs with GPO are guaranteed since GPO is an\nexact proximity operator. Although convergence of PSAs with APO is may not be\nguaranteed, we have experimentally found that APO behaves similarly to GPO when\nthe regularization parameter of the pair-wise L_inf norm is set to an\nappropriately small value. Experiments on recovery of group-sparse signals\n(with unknown groups) show that PSAs with APO are very fast and accurate.\n"]}]

However, the so-termed\nadoption times when blogs mention popular news items, individuals in a\ncommunity catch an infectious disease, or consumers adopt a trendy electronics\nproduct are typically known, and are implicitly dependent on the underlying\nnetwork. To infer the network topology, a \\textit{dynamic} structural equation\nmodel is adopted to capture the relationship between observed adoption times\nand the unknown edge weights. Assuming a slowly time-varying topology and\nleveraging the sparse connectivity inherent to social networks, edge weights\nare estimated by minimizing a sparsity-regularized exponentially-weighted\nleast-squares criterion. To this end, solvers with complementary strengths are\ndeveloped by leveraging (pseudo) real-time sparsity-promoting proximal gradient\niterations, the improved convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced\ncomputational complexity of stochastic gradient descent. Numerical tests with\nboth synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel\nalgorithms in unveiling sparse dynamically-evolving topologies, while\naccounting for external influences in the adoption times.

Here, we dissect the molecular\nmechanisms and functional pressures driving heterochromatin formation and\ndosage compensation of the recently formed neo-sex chromosomes of Drosophila\nmiranda. We show that the onset of heterochromatin formation on the neo-Y is\ntriggered by an accumulation of repetitive DNA. The neo-X has evolved partial\ndosage compensation and we find that diverse mutational paths have been\nutilized to establish several dozen novel binding consensus motifs for the\ndosage compensation complex on the neo-X, including simple point mutations at\npre-binding sites, insertion and deletion mutations, microsatellite expansions,\nor tandem amplification of weak binding sites. Spreading of these silencing or\nactivating chromatin modifications to adjacent regions results in massive\nmis-expression of neo-sex linked genes, and little correspondence between\nfunctionality of genes and their silencing on the neo-Y or dosage compensation\non the neo-X. Intriguingly, the genomic regions being targeted by the dosage\ncompensation complex on the neo-X and those becoming heterochromatic on the\nneo-Y show little overlap, possibly reflecting different propensities along the\nancestral chromosome to adopt active or repressive chromatin configurations.\nOur findings have broad implications for current models of sex chromosome\nevolution, and demonstrate how mechanistic constraints can limit evolutionary\nadaptations. Our study also highlights how evolution can follow predictable\ngenetic trajectories, by repeatedly acquiring the same 21-bp consensus motif\nfor recruitment of the dosage compensation complex, yet utilizing a diverse\narray of random mutational changes to attain the same phenotypic outcome.\n"]}]

We also proposed a composite\nkernel tailored to represent the properties of fake websites, including content\nduplication and structural attributes. Experiments were conducted to assess the\nproposed features, techniques, and kernels on a test bed encompassing nearly\n90,000 web pages derived from 410 legitimate and fake escrow sites. The\ncombination of an extended feature set and the composite kernel attained over\n98% accuracy when differentiating fake sites from real ones, using the support\nvector machines algorithm.
