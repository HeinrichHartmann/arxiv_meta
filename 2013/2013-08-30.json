If this deconfinement phase\ntransition is of the first order then it will be triggered by the nucleation of\na critical size drop of the stable quark phase in the metastable hadronic\nphase.

The main goal of the present work is to establish whether a newborn\nhadronic star (proto-hadronic star) could survive the early stages of its\nevolution without \"decaying\" to a quark star. To this aim, we study the\nnucleation process of quark matter in hot beta-stable hadronic matter, with and\nwithout trapped neutrinos.

In particular, the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) approach has\nbeen recently proposed to model artifacts and their lifecycle in a declarative\nway. In this paper, we enhance GSM with a Semantic Layer, constituted by a\nfull-fledged OWL 2 QL ontology linked to the artifact information models\nthrough mapping specifications. The ontology provides a conceptual view of the\ndomain under study, and allows one to understand the evolution of the artifact\nsystem at a higher level of abstraction. In this setting, we present a\ntechnique to specify temporal properties expressed over the Semantic Layer, and\nverify them according to the evolution in the underlying GSM model. This\ntechnique has been implemented in a tool that exploits state-of-the-art\nontology-based data access technologies to manipulate the temporal properties\naccording to the ontology and the mappings, and that relies on the GSMC model\nchecker for verification.\n"]}]

In our scheme, Gaussian beams are multiplexed\nwith a set of spatial phase masks, and then transmitted in the Fourier domain\nvia spherical lens. And another phase masks with matched patterns sandwiched by\ntwo lenses are used to de-multiplex the corresponding channels. Three different\nphase masks, namely, planar linear encoding, radial linear encoding and hybrid\nof radial and azimuthal linear encoding, are proposed and analyzed. The\nmultiplexing and de-multiplexing of Gaussian beams are successfully implemented\nusing these phase encoding approaches.

I use simulation by an\nagent-based model as well as the mathematics of multi-type branching-processes\nto illustrate how the SS epidemic differs from the more familiar uniform\nepidemic (e.g., caused by influenza). The conclusions may surprise the reader:\n(a) The SS epidemic must be described by at least two numbers, such as the mean\nreproductive number (of \"secondary\" cases caused by a \"primary case\"), R0, and\nthe variance of same, call it V0; (b) Even if R0 > 1, if V0 >> R0 the\nprobability that an infection-chain caused by one primary case goes extinct\nwithout intervention may be close to one (e.g., 0.97); (c) The SS epidemic may\nhave a long \"kindling period\" in which sporadic cases appear (transmitted from\nsome unknown host) and generate a cluster of cases, but the chains peter out,\nperhaps generating a false sense of security that a pandemic will not occur;\n(d) Interventions such as isolation (or contact-tracing and secondary case\nisolation) may prove efficacious even without driving R0 below one; (e) The\nefficacy of such interventions diminishes, but slowly, with increasing V0 at\nfixed R0. From these considerations, I argue that the SS epidemic has dynamics\nsufficiently distinct from the uniform case that efficacious public-health\ninterventions can be designed even in the absence of a vaccine or other form of\ntreatment.\n"]}]

This poses a fundamental limitation to optically imaging, sensing,\nand manipulating targets embedded in opaque scattering layers such as\nbiological tissues. One strategy for mitigating the shallow wave penetration is\nto exploit eigenmodes with anomalously high transmittance existing in any\ndisordered medium. When waves are coupled to these eigenmodes, strong\nconstructive wave interference enhances deeply penetrating waves. However,\nfinding such eigenmodes has been a challenging task due to the complexity of\ndisordered media. In this Letter, we present an iterative wavefront control\nmethod that selectively enriches the coupling of incident beam to\nhigh-transmission eigenmodes. Specifically, we refined the high-transmission\neigenmodes from an arbitrary initial wave by either maximizing transmitted wave\nintensity or minimizing reflected wave intensity. Using the proposed method, we\nachieved more than a factor of 3 increases in light transmission through a\nscattering medium exhibiting hundreds of scattering events.
