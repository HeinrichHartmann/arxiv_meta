It is shown that the proposed technique provides,\nin general, a larger feasibility set with respect to existing approaches, given\nthe same computational complexity. Moreover, a new receding horizon strategy is\nintroduced, exploiting the generalized terminal state constraint.

In order\nto make a unique and straightforward connection between an idealized,\nnumerically calculated shape of an elastic shell and a capsid, we devised a\nspecial shape fitting procedure, the outcome of which is the idealized elastic\nshape fitting the capsid best.

Photometric quasars, which can be seen\nfrom cosmological redshifts z>2 even in wide-shallow optical surveys, are\npromising tracers for constraining non-Gaussianity using this effect. However,\nlarge-scale systematics can also mimic this signature of non-Gaussianity. In\norder to assess the contribution of systematic effects, we cross-correlate\noverdensity maps of photometric quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) Data Release 6 (DR6) in different redshift ranges. We find that the maps\nare significantly correlated on large scales, even though we expect the angular\ndistributions of quasars at different redshifts to be uncorrelated. This\nimplies that the quasar maps are contaminated with systematic errors. We\ninvestigate the use of external templates that provide information on the\nspatial dependence of potential systematic errors to reduce the level of\nspurious clustering in the quasar data. We find that templates associated with\nstellar density, the stellar color locus, airmass, and seeing are major\ncontaminants of the quasar maps, with seeing having the largest effect. Using\ntemplate projection, we are able to decrease the significance of the\ncross-correlation measurement on the largest scales from 9.2-sigma to\n5.4-sigma. Although this is an improvement, the remaining cross-correlation\nsuggests the contamination in this quasar sample is too great to allow a\ncompetitive constraint on fNL by correlations internal to this sample. The SDSS\nquasar catalog exhibits spurious number density fluctuations of ~2% rms, and we\nneed a contamination level less than 1% (0.6%) in order to measure values of\nfNL less than 100 (10).

In this paper, a local model\nof the radial chemical component flux is established based on the hydrodynamic\nequations and some model assumptions. The model is tested in stellar models.\nThe main conclusions are as follows. (i) The local model shows that the\nconvective and overshoot mixing could be regarded as a diffusion process, and\nthe diffusion coefficient for different chemical element is the same. However,\nif the non-local terms, i.e., the turbulent convective transport of radial\nchemical component flux, are taken into account, the diffusion coefficient for\neach chemical element should be in general different. (ii) The diffusion\ncoefficient of convective / overshoot mixing shows different behaviors in\nconvection zone and in overshoot region because the characteristic length scale\nof the mixing is large in the convection zone and small in the overshoot\nregion. The overshoot mixing should be regarded as a weak mixing process.

For oncogenes\nspecifically, current research suggests that there is a small set of \"driver\"\nmutations that are primarily responsible for tumorigenesis. Further, due to\nsome recent pharmacological successes in treating these driver mutations and\ntheir resulting tumors, a variety of methods have been developed to identify\npotential driver mutations using methods such as machine learning and\nmutational clustering. We propose a novel methodology that increases our power\nto identify mutational clusters by taking into account protein tertiary\nstructure via a graph theoretical approach.\n  Results: We have designed and implemented GraphPAC (Graph Protein Amino Acid\nClustering) to identify mutational clustering while considering protein spatial\nstructure. Using GraphPAC, we are able to detect novel clusters in proteins\nthat are known to exhibit mutation clustering as well as identify clusters in\nproteins without evidence of prior clustering based on current methods.\nSpecifically, by utilizing the spatial information available in the Protein\nData Bank (PDB) along with the mutational data in the Catalogue of Somatic\nMutations in Cancer (COSMIC), GraphPAC identifies new mutational clusters in\nwell known oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS. Further, by utilizing graph theory\nto account for the tertiary structure, GraphPAC identifies clusters in DPP4,\nNRP1 and other proteins not identified by existing methods.

Close to the critical dimension, the assumption of well-stirred\nreactants is violated by anticorrelations between the particles, and the law of\nmass action breaks down. The breakdown of the law of mass action is known to be\ncaused by long-range fluctuations. We identify three interrelated consequences\nof these fluctuations. First, despite being a nonuniversal quantity and thus\ndepending on the microscopic details, the renormalized reaction rate can be\napproximated by a universal law close to the critical dimension. The emergence\nof universality relies on the fact that long-range fluctuations suppress the\ninfluence of the underlying microscopic details. Second, as criticality is\napproached, the macroscopic reaction rate decreases such that the law of mass\naction loses its significance. And third, additional nonanalytic power law\ncorrections complement the analytic law of mass action term. An increasing\nnumber of those corrections accumulate and give an essential contribution as\nthe critical dimension is approached. We test our findings for two\nimplementations of L\\'evy flights that differ in the way they cross over to the\nnormal diffusion.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures; corrected typos"]}]

The\ncomputation extended to all mass tracers of the sample provides a detailed map\nof the negative potential fluctuations.

TWR is possible when two nodes exchange data\nsimultaneously through a relay. In cellular systems, data exchange between base\nstation (BS) and users is usually not simultaneous e.g., a user (TUE) has\nuplink data to transmit during multiple access (MAC) phase, but does not have\ndownlink data to receive during broadcast (BC) phase. This non-simultaneous\ndata exchange will reduce TWR to spectrally-inefficient conventional\nhalf-duplex relaying. With infrastructure relays, where multiple users\ncommunicate through a relay, a new transmission protocol is proposed to recover\nthe spectral loss. The BC phase following the MAC phase of TUE is now used by\nthe relay to transmit downlink data to another user (RUE). RUE will not be able\nto cancel the back-propagating interference. A structured precoder is designed\nat the multi-antenna relay to cancel this interference. With multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) nodes, the proposed precoder also triangulates the\ncompound MAC and BC phase MIMO channels.

In this study, the\nresults of global 3-D MHD simulations of accretion flows, in both stable and\nunstable regimes, are used to predict the variability of hydrogen emission\nlines and light curves associated with those two distinctive accretion flow\npatterns. In the stable regime, a redshifted absorption component (RAC)\nperiodically appears in some hydrogen lines, but only during a fraction of a\nstellar rotation period. In the unstable regime, the RAC is present rather\npersistently during a whole stellar rotation period, and its strength varies\nnon-periodically. The latter is caused by multiple accreting streams, formed\nrandomly due to the instability, passing across the line of sight to an\nobserver during one stellar rotation. This results in the quasi-stationarity\nappearance of the RAC because at least one of the accretion stream is almost\nalways in the line of sight to an observer. In the stable regime, two stable\nhot spots produce a smooth and periodic light curve that shows only one or two\npeaks per stellar rotation.

One of the\nadvantages of this method is its general applicability since, as sequence\nalignment is not required, the DNA sequences chosen for comparison can be\ncompletely different regions in different genomes. In fact, this method can be\nused to compare any two DNA sequences.

They are a particular case of\nconditional independences that is true only for a certain assignment of its\nconditioning set, in contrast to conditional independences that must hold for\nall its assignments. In this work we present CSPC, an independence-based\nalgorithm for learning structures that encode context-specific independences,\nand encoding them in a log-linear model, instead of a graph. The central idea\nof CSPC is combining the theoretical guarantees provided by the\nindependence-based approach with the benefits of representing complex\nstructures by using features in a log-linear model. We present experiments in a\nsynthetic case, showing that CSPC is more accurate than the state-of-the-art IB\nalgorithms when the underlying distribution contains CSIs.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures"]}]

After approximately 35\niterations a stability of eight significant figures for the energy eigenvalues\nis obtained.This method has the advantage of being physically intuitive, and\ncould be extended to the calculation of a shell-model potential in nuclear\nphysics, once the Pauli exclusion principle is allowed for.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Phys.

Modeling Temporal Intention in Resource\n  Sharing"],"description":["  The web is trapped in the \"perpetual now\", and when users traverse from page\nto page, they are seeing the state of the web resource (i.e., the page) as it\nexists at the time of the click and not necessarily at the time when the link\nwas made. Thus, a temporal discrepancy can arise between the resource at the\ntime the page author created a link to it and the time when a reader follows\nthe link. This is especially important in the context of social media: the ease\nof sharing links in a tweet or Facebook post allows many people to author web\ncontent, but the space constraints combined with poor awareness by authors\noften prevents sufficient context from being generated to determine the intent\nof the post. If the links are clicked as soon as they are shared, the temporal\ndistance between sharing and clicking is so small that there is little to no\ndifference in content. However, not all clicks occur immediately, and a delay\nof days or even hours can result in reading something other than what the\nauthor intended. We introduce the concept of a user's temporal intention upon\npublishing a link in social media. We investigate the features that could be\nextracted from the post, the linked resource, and the patterns of social\ndissemination to model this user intention. Finally, we analyze the historical\nintegrity of the shared resources in social media across time. In other words,\nhow much is the knowledge of the author's intent beneficial in maintaining the\nconsistency of the story being told through social posts and in enriching the\narchived content coverage and depth of vulnerable resources?\n","Comment: JCDL 2013"]}]
