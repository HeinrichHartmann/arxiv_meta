We consider the problem of approximating a function belonging\nto an arbitrary real-valued RKHS on R^d based on approximate observations of\nthe function. The observations are approximate in the sense that the actual\nobservations (i.e., the true function values) are known only to belong to a\nconvex set of admissible observations. We seek a minimax optimal approximation\nfor the function that minimizes the supremum of the RKHS norm on the error\nbetween the true function and the chosen approximation subject only to the\nconditions that the true function belongs to a uniformly bounded uncertainty\nset of functions that satisfy the constraints on the observations and that the\napproximation is a member of the RKHS. We refer to such a solution as a minimax\nrobust reconstruction. We characterize the solution to the minimax robust\nreconstruction problem and show that it is equivalent to solving a\nstraightforward convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that a minimax\nrobust reconstruction will generally be more stable than an approximation based\non interpolation through a nominal set of observations and that, subject to\nsome mild regularity conditions on the convex set of admissible observations,\nthe minimax robust reconstruction is unconditionally stable. We motivate our\nresults by characterizing the minimax robust reconstruction for several\nspecific convex observational models and discuss relationships with other\napproaches to function approximation.\n"]}]

Within the hidden measurement approach we\npropose a 'sphere model' as a mathematical tool for situations in which\ncontextual risk occurs.

In most anomaly\ndetection algorithms, the dissimilarity between data samples is calculated by a\nsingle criterion, such as Euclidean distance. However, in many cases there may\nnot exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous\npatterns. In such a case, multiple criteria can be defined, and one can test\nfor anomalies by scalarizing the multiple criteria using a linear combination\nof them. If the importance of the different criteria are not known in advance,\nthe algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of\nweights in the linear combination. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nnon-parametric multi-criteria anomaly detection method using Pareto depth\nanalysis (PDA).

Empirical data indicate that this hypothesis works well in stable\nsituations but, in abrupt transitions such as during an economical crisis, the\nrandom walk model fails and alternative descriptions are needed. For this\nreason, several proposals have been recently forwarded which are based on the\nformalism of quantum mechanics. In this paper we apply the 'SCoP formalism',\nelaborated to provide an operational foundation of quantum mechanics, to the\nstock market. We argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual\nsystem where agents' decisions globally influence the market system and stocks\nprices, determining a nonclassical behavior. More specifically, we maintain\nthat a given stock does not generally have a definite value, e.g., a price, but\nits value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the\ntrading process. This contextual influence is responsible of the\nnon-Kolmogorovian quantum-like behavior of the market at a statistical level.\nThen, we propose a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement formalism'\nthat describes a buying/selling process of a stock and shows that it is\nintuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until\nit is traded.

The former enjoys better rate performance, while the latter provides\nmore flexibility to tradeoff between the complexity of the relay mapper and the\nrate performance. It is shown that, in order to approach the rate performance\nachievable by an unstructured codebook with maximum-likelihood decoding, it is\ncrucial to use a new K-stage coset decoder for structured O-MLC, instead of the\none-stage decoder proposed in previous works. However, if O-MLC is decoded with\nthe one-stage decoder only, it can still achieve the optimal DDF\ndiversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime.\nAs for MS-MLC, its rate performance can approach that of the O-MLC by\nincreasing the complexity of the modulo-sum relay-mapper.

The purpose of the extensive experimental\nwork was threefold: to investigate the behavior of the tested algorithms in the\nphase transition, to identify what impact hybridization with the DSatur\ntraditional heuristic has on the evolutionary algorithm, and to show how graph\nstructural features influence the performance of the graph-coloring algorithms.\nThe results indicate that the performance of the hybrid self-adaptive\nevolutionary algorithm is comparable with, or better than, the performance of\nthe hybrid evolutionary algorithm which is one of the best graph-coloring\nalgorithms today.

A major obstacle that poses an existential threat to practical\ndeployment of conventional approaches to distributed coding is the exponential\ngrowth of the decoder complexity with the number of sources and the encoding\nrates. This growth in complexity renders many traditional approaches\nimpractical even for moderately sized networks. In this paper, we propose a new\ndecoding paradigm for large scale distributed compression wherein the decoder\ncomplexity is explicitly controlled during the design. Central to our approach\nis a module called the \"bit-subset selector\" whose role is to judiciously\nextract an appropriate subset of the received bits for decoding per individual\nsource. We propose a practical design strategy, based on deterministic\nannealing (DA) for the joint design of the system components, that enables\ndirect optimization of the decoder complexity-distortion trade-off, and thereby\nthe desired scalability. We also point out the direct connections between the\nproblem of large scale distributed compression and a related problem in sensor\nnetworks, namely, dispersive information routing of correlated sources. This\nallows us to extend the design principles proposed in the context of large\nscale distributed compression to design efficient routers for minimum cost\ncommunication of correlated sources across a network.

Tuning and\nselectivity of cortical neurons in mouse visual cortex is not equivocally\nresolved so far. While many in-vivo experimental studies found inhibitory\nneurons of all subtypes to be broadly tuned for orientation other studies\nreport inhibitory neurons that are as sharply tuned as excitatory neurons.\nThese diverging findings about the selectivity of excitatory and inhibitory\ncortical neurons prompted us to ask the following questions: (1) How different\nor similar is the cortical computation with that in previously described\nspecies that relies on map?

In gene expression models, the concept of\nbursting is a production of several molecules simultaneously and is generally\nrepresented as a compound Poisson process of random size. In a general\ntwo-dimensional birth and death discrete model, we prove that under specific\nassumptions and scaling (that are characteristics of the mRNA-protein system)\nan adiabatic reduction leads to a one-dimensional discrete-state space model\nwith bursting production. The burst term appears through the reduction of the\nfirst variable.
