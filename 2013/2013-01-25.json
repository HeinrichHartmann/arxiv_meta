Second, in relativistic astrophysics, it is the\nstatement that the gravitational far-field of a spherically symmetric star\ncarries, apart from its mass, no information about the star; therefore, a\nradially oscillating star has a static gravitational far-field. Third, in\nmathematical physics, Birkhoff's theorem reads: up to singular exceptions of\nmeasure zero, the spherically symmetric solutions of Einstein's vacuum field\nequation with Lambda = 0 can be expressed by the Schwarzschild metric; for\nLambda unequal 0, it is the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric instead. Fourth, in\ndifferential geometry, any statement of the type: every member of a family of\npseudo-Riemannian space-times has more isometries than expected from the\noriginal metric ansatz, carries the name Birkhoff-type theorem. Within the\nfourth of these classes we present some new results with further values of\ndimension and signature of the related spaces; including them are some\ncounterexamples: families of space-times where no Birkhoff-type theorem is\nvalid. These counterexamples further confirm the conjecture, that the\nBirkhoff-type theorems have their origin in the property, that the two\neigenvalues of the Ricci tensor of two-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian spaces\nalways coincide, a property not having an analogy in higher dimensions. Hence,\nBirkhoff-type theorems exist only for those physical situations which are\nreducible to two dimensions.\n","Comment: 26 pages, updated references, minor text changes, accepted by Gen.\n  Relat.

Without this process,\nthe universe would be dark and dead. Yet the spontaneous concentration of heat\nis exactly what the Second Law of Thermodynamics is in most cases supposed to\nforbid. The formation of protostars has been much discussed, for its\nconsistency with the Second Law depends on a thermodynamical property that is\ncommon in systems whose strongest force is their own gravity, but otherwise\nvery rare: negative specific heat. Negative specific heat turns the world\nupside down, thermodynamically; it implies that entropy increases when energy\nflows from lower to higher energy subsystems, opposite to the usual direction.\nRecent experiments have reported negative specific heat in melting atomic\nclusters and fragmenting nuclei, but these arguably represent transient\nphenomena outside the proper scope of thermodynamics. Here we show that the\ncounter-intuitive thermodynamics of spontaneous energy concentration can be\nstudied experimentally with trapped quantum gases, by using optical lattice\npotentials to realize weakly coupled arrays of simple dynamical subsystems that\nshare the peculiar property of self-gravitating protostars, of having negative\nmicro-canonical specific heat. Numerical solution of real-time evolution\nequations confirms the spontaneous concentration of energy in such arrays, with\ninitially dispersed energy condensing quickly into dense 'droplets'. We\ntherefore propose laboratory studies of negative specific heat as an elusive\nbut fundamentally important aspect of thermodynamics, which may shed fresh\nlight on the general problem of how thermodynamics emerges from mechanics.\n"]}]

Traditionally, this problem was tackled by sequentially comparing the\ngiven query against all the time series in the database, and returning all the\ntime series that are within a predetermined threshold of that query. But the\nlarge size and the high dimensionality of time series databases that are in use\nnowadays make that scenario inefficient. There are many representation\ntechniques that aim at reducing the dimensionality of time series so that the\nsearch can be handled faster at a lower-dimensional space level. The symbolic\naggregate approximation (SAX) is one of the most competitive methods in the\nliterature. In this paper we present a new method that improves the performance\nof SAX by adding to it another exclusion condition that increases the exclusion\npower. This method is based on using two representations of the time series:\none of SAX and the other is based on an optimal approximation of the time\nseries. Pre-computed distances are calculated and stored offline to be used\nonline to exclude a wide range of the search space using two exclusion\nconditions.

The aim of this study is to provide observational constraints\non theoretical prediction that the winds of M-type AGB objects can be driven by\nphoton scattering on iron-free silicate grains located in the close environment\n(about 2 to 3 stellar radii) of the star. We interpreted\nspectro-interferometric data, first using wavelength-dependent geometric\nmodels. We then used a self-consistent dynamic model atmosphere containing a\ntime-dependent description of grain growth for pure forsterite dust particles\nto reproduce the photometric, spectrometric, and interferometric measurements\nof RT Vir. Since the hydrodynamic computation needs stellar parameters as\ninput, a considerable effort was first made to determine these parameters.

Results from the geometrical modeling give us clues to the presence\nof aluminum and silicate dust in the close circumstellar environment (< ~5\nstellar radii). Comparison between spectro-interferometric data and a\nself-consistent dust-driven wind model reveals that silicate dust has to be\npresent in the region between 2 to 3 stellar radii to reproduce the 59 and 63 m\nbaseline visibility measurements around 9.8 micron.

The agreement of the dynamic model\natmosphere with interferometric measurements in the 8-10 micron spectral region\ngives additional observational evidence that the winds of M-type stars can be\ndriven by photon scattering on iron-free silicate grains.
