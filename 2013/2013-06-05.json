We find dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process\ninvolving population bottlenecks in both lineages and post-divergence gene\nflow, which confounds previous inferences of dog origins. In dogs, the\ndomestication bottleneck was severe involving a 17 to 49-fold reduction in\npopulation size, a much stronger bottleneck than estimated previously from less\nintensive sequencing efforts. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after\ntheir divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs\narose was far larger than represented by modern wolf populations.

Regarding the geographic\norigin of dogs, we find that surprisingly, none of the extant wolf lineages\nfrom putative domestication centers are more closely related to dogs, and the\nsampled wolves instead form a sister monophyletic clade.

We\ndemonstrate the method's efficiency by computing equilibrium wetting states of\nentire droplets sitting on geometrically structured surfaces, and compare the\nresults with those of the mesoscopic Lattice Boltzmann simulations. The\napplication of well-established parameter continuation techniques enables the\ntracing of stable and unstable equilibrium solutions if necessary for the\ndetermination of energy barriers separating co-existing stable wettign states.\nSince energy barriers determine whether a surface facilitates or inhibits\ncertain wetting transitions, their computation is important for many technical\napplications.

Preferential attachment (PA) is considered a common explanation to the\nself organization of evolving networks, suggesting that new nodes prefer to\nattach to more popular nodes. The PA model results in broad degree\ndistributions, found in many networks, but cannot explain other common\nproperties such as: The growth of nodes arriving late and Clustering (community\nstructure). Here we show that when the tendency of networks to adhere to trends\nis incorporated into the PA model, it can produce networks with such\nproperties. Namely, in trending networks, newly arriving nodes may become\ncentral at random, forming new clusters. In particular, we show that when the\nnetwork is young it is more susceptible to trends, but even older networks may\nhave trendy new nodes that become central in their structure. Alternatively,\nnetworks can be seen as composed of two parts: static, governed by a power law\ndegree distribution, and a dynamic part governed by trends, as we show on Wiki\npages. Our results also show that the arrival of trending new nodes not only\ncreates new clusters, but also has an effect on the relative importance and\ncentrality of all other nodes in the network. This can explain a variety of\nreal world networks in economics, social and online networks, and cultural\nnetworks. Products popularity, formed by the network of people's opinions,\nexhibit these properties.

No mathematical proofs are known\nfor the long-term security of such techniques.
