On the other hand, since the turbulent flow characteristically appears in\nthe form of spatially localized structures (e.g., eddies) filling the flow\nfield, a tendency to occupy such a structured state of the flow cannot be ruled\nout as a driving force for turbulent transition. To examine this possibility,\nwe propose a simple analytical model that treats the flow as a collection of\nlocalized spatial structures, each of which consists of elementary cells in\nwhich the behavior of the particles (atoms or molecules) is uncorrelated. This\nallows us to introduce the Reynolds number, associating it with the ratio\nbetween the total phase volume for the system and that for the elementary cell.\nUsing the principle of maximum entropy to calculate the most probable size\ndistribution of the localized structures, we show that as the Reynolds number\nincreases, the elementary cells group into the localized structures, which\nsuccessfully explains turbulent transition and some other general properties of\nturbulent flows. We show that the basic assumptions underlying the model, i.e.\nthat the particles are indistinguishable and elementary volumes of phase space\nexist in which the state of the particles is uncertain, are involved in the\nderivation of the Navier-Stokes equation. Taking into account that the model\ncaptures essential features of turbulent flows, this suggests that the driving\nforce for the turbulent transition is basically the same as in the present\nmodel, i.e. the tendency of the system to occupy a statistically dominant state\nplays a key role.

This leads to T2-and\nMT-shine-through effects in the actual biochemical contrast of CEST. Therefore,\na simple evaluation algorithm which corrects the CEST signal was searched for.\nBy employing a recent eigenspace theory valid for spinlock and continuous wave\n(cw) CEST we predict that the inverse Z-spectrum is beneficial to Z-spectrum\nitself. Based on this we propose a new spillover- and MT-corrected\nmagnetization transfer ratio (MTRRex) yielding Rex, the exchange dependent\nrelaxation rate in the rotating frame. For verification, the amine proton\nexchange of creatine in solutions with different agar concentration was studied\nexperimentally at clinical field strength of 3T. In contrast to the compared\nstandard evaluation for pulsed CEST experiments, MTRasym, our approach shows no\nT2 or MT shine through effect. We demonstrate that spillover can be corrected\nproperly and also quantitative evaluation of pH and creatine concentration is\npossible which proves MTRRex as quantitative CEST-MRI method. A spillover\ncorrection is of special interest for clinical static field strengths and\nprotons resonating near the water peak. This is the case for -OH-CEST effects\nlike gagCEST or glucoCEST, but also amine exchange of creatine or glutamate\nwhich require high B1. Although, only showed for amine exchange, we propose our\nnormalization to work generally for DIACEST, PARACEST in slow- and fast\nexchange regime not just as a correction, but also for quantitative CEST-MRI.\nApplied to acute stroke induced in rat brain, the corrected CEST signal shows\nsignificantly higher contrast between stroke area and normal tissue as well as\nless B1 dependency compared to conventional approaches.\n"]}]

Recently, Keim & Nagel showed how multiple transient memories\ncould be generalized to a generic driven disordered system with noise, giving\nas an example simulations of a simple model of a sheared non-Brownian\nsuspension. Here, we further explore simulation models of suspensions under\ncyclic shear, focussing on three main themes: robustness, structure, and\noverdriving. We show that multiple transient memories are a robust feature\nindependent of many details of the model. The steady-state spatial distribution\nof the particles is sensitive to the driving algorithm; nonetheless, the memory\nformation is independent of such a change in particle correlations. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that overdriving provides another means for controlling memory\nformation and retention.\n"]}]
