Relative to the former, it has been stated that cosmology\nhas entered a 'golden age', in which high-precision observational data have\nconfirmed with startling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a phase of\naccelerated expansion. Several candidates, responsible for this expansion, have\nbeen proposed in the literature, in particular, dark energy models and modified\ngravity, amongst others. One is liable to ask: What is the so-called 'dark\nenergy' that is driving the acceleration of the universe? Is it a vacuum energy\nor a dynamical field (''quintessence'')? Or is the acceleration due to\ninfra-red modifications of Einstein's theory of General Relativity? In the\ncontext of dark matter, two observations, namely, the behavior of the galactic\nrotation curves and the mass discrepancy in galactic clusters, suggest the\nexistence of a (non or weakly interacting) form of dark matter at galactic and\nextra-galactic scales. It has also been proposed that modified gravity can\nexplain the galactic dynamics without the need of introducing dark matter. We\nbriefly review some of the modified theories of gravity that address these two\nintriguing and exciting problems facing modern physics.\n","Comment: 17 pages, invited chapter to appear in an edited collection 'Dark\n  Energy-Current Advances and Ideas'"]}]

However, in most instances the control\nlaw is obtained without any performance considerations and it has to be\ncalculated by solving a complex partial differential equation (PDE). In order\nto address these issues we introduce a reinforcement learning approach into the\nenergy-balancing passivity-based control (EB-PBC) method, which is a form of\nPBC in which the closed-loop energy is equal to the difference between the\nstored and supplied energies. We propose a technique to parameterize EB-PBC\nthat preserves the systems's PDE matching conditions, does not require the\nspecification of a global desired Hamiltonian, includes performance criteria,\nand is robust to extra non-linearities such as control input saturation. The\nparameters of the control law are found using actor-critic reinforcement\nlearning, enabling learning near-optimal control policies satisfying a desired\nclosed-loop energy landscape. The advantages are that near-optimal controllers\ncan be generated using standard energy shaping techniques and that the\nsolutions learned can be interpreted in terms of energy shaping and damping\ninjection, which makes it possible to numerically assess stability using\npassivity theory. From the reinforcement learning perspective, our proposal\nallows for the class of port-Hamiltonian systems to be incorporated in the\nactor-critic framework, speeding up the learning thanks to the resulting\nparameterization of the policy.

We present a linear\nmatrix model and show the excellent agreement with our numerical results. The\nmatrix model includes both exceptional points found in the double-well\npotential, namely an EP2 at the tangent bifurcation and an EP3 at the pitchfork\nbifurcation. When the two bifurcation points coincide the matrix model\npossesses four degenerate eigenvectors. Close to that point we observe the\ncharacteristic features of four interacting modes in both the matrix model and\nthe numerical calculations, which provides clear evidence for the existence of\nan EP4.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 11 figures, additions in the text, to be published in J.\n  Phys.

The Dirac Equation led to one of the\ngreatest advances in our understanding of the physical world. In this reading,\nwe ask the seemingly senseless question, \"Do negative probabilities exist in\nquantum mechanics?\" In an effort to answer this question, we arrive at the\nconclusion that depending on the choice one makes of the quantum probability\ncurrent, one will obtain negative probabilities. We thus propose a new quantum\nprobability current of the Klein-Gordon theory. This quantum probability\ncurrent leads directly to positive definite quantum probabilities. Because\nthese negative probabilities are in the bare Klein-Gordon theory, intrinsically\na result of negative energies, the fact that we here arrive at a theory with\npositive probabilities, means that negative energy particles are not to be\nconsidered problematic as is the case in the bare Klein-Gordon theory. From an\nabstract-objective stand-point; in comparison with positive energy particles,\nthe corollary is that negative energy particles should have equal chances to\nexist. As to why these negative energy particles do not exist, this is\nanalogous to asking why is it that Dirac's antimatter does not exist in equal\nproportions with matter.

One of the\nless understood aspects of the sea ice response is the persistence times for\nfluctuations, which could indicate the dominant physical processes behind the\nsea ice decline. To determine the fluctuation persistence times, however, it is\nnecessary to first filter out the dominant effect of the seasonal cycle. In the\ncurrent study, we thus develop a statistical model, which accurately decomposes\nthe ice area changes into: (1) a variable seasonal cycle component with a\nconstant shape and (2) a residual (short term) fluctuation.\n  We find the persistence time of fluctuations to be only about three weeks,\nindependently from season, which is substantially shorter than previously\nreported. Such short time scale points to the dominance of atmospheric forcing.\nThe shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly constant for the whole\nobservational record despite the rapid decline. This is in agreement with the\nsuggestion that the asymmetry of the seasonal cycle is an effect of Arctic\nland-sea geography, which has not changed with climate change.\n  The analysis suggest a jump in the annual sea ice area amplitude occurring in\n2007, from which it has not yet recovered, possibly revealing a permanent\namplitude shift.

The SOPPA-srDFT scheme is tested for a subset of\nmolecules used for benchmarking TD-MC-srDFT and performs slightly better\nagainst the reference data for this small subset. Beyond the proof-of-principle\ncalculations comprising the first part of this contribution, we additionally\nstudied the low-lying singlet excited states (S1 and S2) of the retinal\nchromophore. The chromophore displays multireference character in the ground\nstate and both excited states exhibit considerable double excitation character,\nwhich in turn cannot be described within standard TD-DFT, due to the adiabatic\napproximation. However, a TD-MC-srDFT approach can account for the\nmultireference character, and excitation energies are obtained with accuracy\ncomparable to CASPT2, although using a much smaller active space.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

We\nshow that levels of neutral polymorphism are lower near amino acid\nsubstitutions, with the strongest reduction observed specifically near\nfunctionally consequential amino acid substitutions. Furthermore, amino acid\nsubstitutions are associated with signatures of recent adaptation that should\nnot be generated by background selection, such as the presence of unusually\nlong and frequent haplotypes and specific distortions in the site frequency\nspectrum. We use forward simulations to show that the observed signatures\nrequire a high rate of strongly adaptive substitutions in the vicinity of the\namino acid changes. We further demonstrate that the observed signatures of\npositive selection correlate more strongly with the presence of regulatory\nsequences, as predicted by ENCODE (Gerstein et al. 2012), than the positions of\namino acid substitutions. Our results establish that adaptation was frequent in\nhuman evolution and provide support for the hypothesis of King and Wilson (King\nand Wilson 1975) that adaptive divergence is primarily driven by regulatory\nchanges.\n"]}]

The instrument yields simultaneously the polarization\nstate of light in two spectral ranges at 396 nm and 630 nm. The measurement is\nperformed with a rotating retarder, which modulates the incident polarization.\nThe modulation is transformed into a varying intensity through polarizing\nbeamsplitters. The demodulation uses a weighted integration scheme to obtain\nthe full Stokes vector of the radiation. The calibration of the polarimeter is\nperformed through the evaluation of a calibration data set produced with a\ncalibration unit consisting of a linear polarizer and a retarder.

While the consensus is\nthat interdependence does promote cooperation by means of organizational\ncomplexity and enhanced reciprocity that is out of reach on isolated networks,\nwe here address the question just how much interdependence there should be.\nIntuitively, one might assume the more the better. However, we show that in\nfact only an intermediate density of sufficiently strong interactions between\nnetworks warrants an optimal resolution of social dilemmas. This is due to an\nintricate interplay between the heterogeneity that causes an asymmetric\nstrategy flow because of the additional links between the networks, and the\nindependent formation of cooperative patterns on each individual network.\nPresented results are robust to variations of the strategy updating rule, the\ntopology of interdependent networks, and the governing social dilemma, thus\nsuggesting a high degree of universality.\n","Comment: 8 two-column pages, 7 figures; accepted for publication in Scientific\n  Reports"]}]
