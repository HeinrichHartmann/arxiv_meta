Quasar spectra\ncontain strong emission lines that can seriously affect the colors in\nphotometric systems in which the transmission characteristics vary abruptly and\nsignificantly with redshift.

Applications of WSNs are numerous\nand growing, and range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office\nto outdoor deployment scenarios in adversary's territory in a tactical\nbattleground (Akyildiz et al., 2002). For military environment, dispersal of\nWSNs into an adversary's territory enables the detection and tracking of enemy\nsoldiers and vehicles. For home/office environments, indoor sensor networks\noffer the ability to monitor the health of the elderly and to detect intruders\nvia a wireless home security system. In each of these scenarios, lives and\nlivelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of the sensor data\nobtained from dispersed sensor nodes. As a result, such WSNs must be secured to\nprevent an intruder from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and\nfrom forging sensor data. To address the latter problem, end-to-end data\nintegrity checksums and post-processing of senor data can be used to identify\nforged sensor data (Estrin et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2003a; Ye et al., 2004).\nThe focus of this chapter is on routing security in WSNs. Most of the currently\nexisting routing protocols for WSNs make an optimization on the limited\ncapabilities of the nodes and the application-specific nature of the network,\nbut do not any the security aspects of the protocols. Although these protocols\nhave not been designed with security as a goal, it is extremely important to\nanalyze their security properties. When the defender has the liabilities of\ninsecure wireless communication, limited node capabilities, and possible\ninsider threats, and the adversaries can use powerful laptops with high energy\nand long range communication to attack the network, designing a secure routing\nprotocol for WSNs is obviously a non-trivial task.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables 4. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1011.1529"]}]

The line narrowing is observed to begin when the\nn-transition density, D_{n}, exceeds ~11.6 transitions per GHz.

This is an interesting proposal. However, there\nare serious problems with their analysis that need to be pointed out. Perhaps\nthe most important of these is the fact that for principal quantum numbers\nbelow n = 200, where the widths are not in question, their processed generated\nprofile widths do not fit the widths of the processed lines obtained at the\ntelescope. After processing, the halfwidths of the generated and telescope\nprofiles must agree below n = 200 if we are to believe that the processed\ngenerated linewidths above n = 200 are meaningful. Theirs do not. Furthermore,\nwe find that after applying the linewidth reduction factors found by Alexander\nand Gulyaev for their noise added profiles to our generated profiles to\nsimulate their noise adding effect, the processed widths we obtain still do not\ncome close to explaining the narrowing seen in the telescope lines for n values\nin the range 200 < n < 250.

Several recent studies\nargue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible\nbifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models. However, a broader\ndefinition of a `tipping point' also includes other abrupt, non-linear changes\nthat are neither bifurcations nor necessarily irreversible. Examination of\nsatellite data for Arctic sea-ice area reveals an abrupt increase in the\namplitude of seasonal variability in 2007 that has persisted since then. We\nidentified this abrupt transition using recently developed methods that can\ndetect multi-modality in time-series data and sometimes forewarn of\nbifurcations. When removing the mean seasonal cycle (up to 2008) from the\nsatellite data, the residual sea-ice fluctuations switch from uni-modal to\nmulti-modal behaviour around 2007. We originally interpreted this as a\nbifurcation in which a new lower ice cover attractor appears in deseasonalised\nfluctuations and is sampled in every summer-autumn from 2007 onwards. However,\nthis interpretation is clearly sensitive to how the seasonal cycle is removed\nfrom the raw data, and to the presence of continental land masses restricting\nwinter-spring ice fluctuations. Furthermore, there was no robust early warning\nsignal of critical slowing down prior to the hypothesized bifurcation. Early\nwarning indicators do however show destabilization of the summer-autumn sea-ice\ncover since 2007. Thus, the bifurcation hypothesis lacks consistent support,\nbut there was an abrupt and persistent increase in the amplitude of the\nseasonal cycle of Arctic sea-ice cover in 2007, which we describe as a\n(non-bifurcation) `tipping point'. Our statistical methods detect this `tipping\npoint' and its time of onset.\n","Comment: 33 pages with 15 figure; accepted for publication in the Cryosphere\n  (2013)"]}]

The argument is based on the existence of a sharp exponential\nultraviolet cutoff in momentum space on the eigenfunctions of the quantum\ncosmological dynamical evolution operator (the gravitational part of the\nHamiltonian constraint), attributable to the fundamental discreteness of\nspatial volume in loop quantum cosmology. The existence of the cutoff is proved\ndirectly from recently found exact solutions for the eigenfunctions for this\nmodel.

This is an improvement upon previous\nmethods, which enables us to efficiently apply our method to\ncontinuous-variable systems, as IC-POVMs are readily available from homodyne or\nheterodyne measurements. We show that quantum discord for Gaussian states can\nbe verified by checking whether the peaks of the conditional Wigner functions\ncorresponding to two different outcomes of heterodyne measurement coincide at\nthe same point in the phase space. Using this method, we also prove that the\nonly Gaussian states with zero discord are product states; hence, Gaussian\nstates with Gaussian discord have nonzero quantum discord.\n","Comment: 5 pages"]}]

Nevertheless, upon\nfurther examination at least one case turned out to be of galactic origin. This\nparticular event presented a Fast Rise, Exponential Decay (FRED) structure\nwhich leads us to believe that other FRED sources might also be Galactic. This\nstudy was set out to estimate the most probable degree of contamination by\ngalactic sources that certain samples of FREDs have. In order to quantify the\ndegree of anisotropy the average dipolar and quadripolar moments of each sample\nof GRBs with respect to the galactic plane were calculated. This was then\ncompared to the probability distribution of simulated samples comprised of a\ncombination of isotropically generated sources and galactic sources.

There are, of course, many possible criteria. Model simplicity is\none of the most common criteria in theory evaluation. The Minimum Message\nLength (MML) is a solid approach to evaluate theories relative to a given\nevidence or data. Theories can be expressed in specific or general\n(Turing-complete) languages. First-order logic, and logic programming in\nparticular, is a Turing-complete language. Evaluating the simplicity of a\ntheory or program described in a Turing-complete language is much more\ndifficult than just counting the number of lines or bits. It is, in fact, the\nproblem of calculating its Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable. Few\nworks in the literature have been able to present accurate and effective\napproximations for a Turing-complete language. In this work, we present the\nfirst general MML coding scheme for logic programs. With this scheme, we can\nquantify the bits of information required to code (or send) a theory, a set of\ndata or the same data given the theory. As a realization of the above-mentioned\nschemes, we present a software tool which is able to code and evaluate a set of\nalternative (stochastic) theories (programs) against a set of examples. We\nillustrate the application of the tool to a variety of non-probabilistic and\nprobabilistic scenarios.\n","Comment: MsC Thesis"]}]

For 70$^{+10}_{-17}%$ of the galaxies we have been able to determine the\ntype of the bulge, and find that these objects probably harbor a pseudobulge or\na combination of classical bulge/ pseudobulge, suggesting that pseudobulges\nmight be frequent in intermediate-type AGN.

Therefore, narrow double-peaked\nemission lines seem to be frequent in galaxies harboring a pseudobulge or a\ncombination of classical bulge/ pseudobulge.

Particularly, the presence of wall slip\nnearly suppresses the scaling of the deformation power deficit associated to\nthe rheological hysteresis with the rate at which the material is forced. The\nirreversible solid-fluid transition and the wall slip behaviour emerge in the\nsame range of the applied stresses and thus, the two phenomena appear to be\ncoupled to each other. In-situ measurements of the flow fields performed during\nan increasing/decreasing stepped pressure ramp reveal three distinct flow\nregimes: solid (pluglike), solid-fluid and fluid. The deformation power deficit\nassociated with the hysteresis observed during the increasing/decreasing\nbranches of the pressure ramps reveals a dependence on the rate at which the\nunsteady flow is driven consistent with that observed during the rheological\nmeasurements in the presence of slip. The dependence of the slip velocity on\nthe wall shear stresses reveals a Navier-type slip behaviour only within the\nfluid flow regime, which indicates that the wall slip phenomenon is directly\ncoupled to the solid-fluid transition. A universal scaling of the slip velocity\nwith the wall velocity gradients is found and the slip length is independent on\nthe characteristic time of forcing t0. The paper closes with a discussion of\nthe main findings, their possible impact on our current understanding of the\nyielding and slip behaviour of Carbopol gels. Several steps worth being pursued\nby future experimental/theoretical studies are proposed.\n"]}]

We develop a theoretical framework aimed at\npredicting the behaviour of existing drag reduction techniques when used at the\nlarge values of Re which are typical of applications. We focus on one recently\nproposed and very promising technique, which consists in creating at the wall\nstreamwise-travelling waves of spanwise velocity. A perturbation analysis of\nthe Navier-Stokes equations that govern the fluid motion is carried out, for\nthe simplest wall-bounded flow geometry, i.e. the plane channel flow. The\nstreamwise base flow is perturbed by the spanwise time-varying base flow\ninduced by the travelling waves. An asymptotic expansion is then carried out\nwith respect to the velocity amplitude of the travelling wave. The analysis,\nalthough based on several assumptions, leads to predictions of drag reduction\nthat agree well with the measurements available in literature and mostly\ncomputed through DNS of the full Navier-Stokes equations. New DNS data are\nproduced on purpose in this work to validate our method further. The method is\nthen applied to predict the drag-reducing performance of the\nstreamwise-travelling waves at increasing Re, where comparison data are not\navailable. The current belief, based on a Re-range of about one decade only\nabove the transitional value, that drag reduction obtained at low Re is deemed\nto decrease as Re is increased is fully confirmed by our results. From a\nquantitative standpoint, however, our outlook based on several decades of\nincrease in Re is much less pessimistic than other existing estimates, and\nmotivates further, more accurate studies on the present subject.\n"]}]
