Over the past few\ndecades, several theories of emotion have been proposed, each based around the\nexistence of a set of 'basic emotions', and each supported by an extensive\nvariety of research including studies in facial expression, ethology, neurology\nand physiology. Here we present research based on a theory that people transmit\ntheir understanding of emotions through the language they use surrounding\nemotion keywords. Using a labelled corpus of over 21,000 tweets, six of the\nbasic emotion sets proposed in existing literature were analysed using Latent\nSemantic Clustering (LSC), evaluating the distinctiveness of the semantic\nmeaning attached to the emotional label. We hypothesise that the more distinct\nthe language is used to express a certain emotion, then the more distinct the\nperception (including proprioception) of that emotion is, and thus more\n'basic'. This allows us to select the dimensions best representing the entire\nspectrum of emotion. We find that Ekman's set, arguably the most frequently\nused for classifying emotions, is in fact the most semantically distinct\noverall. Next, taking all analysed (that is, previously proposed) emotion terms\ninto account, we determine the optimal semantically irreducible basic emotion\nset using an iterative LSC algorithm. Our newly-derived set (Accepting,\nAshamed, Contempt, Interested, Joyful, Pleased, Sleepy, Stressed) generates a\n6.1% increase in distinctiveness over Ekman's set (Angry, Disgusted, Joyful,\nSad, Scared).
