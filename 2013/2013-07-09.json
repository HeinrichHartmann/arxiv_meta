In practice, however, networks have transmission\ndelays. In network coding theory, such networks with transmission delays are\ngenerally abstracted by assuming that their edges have integer delays.

Introduction Modern network are multi-layer by their structure.

The paper formulates the problem of synthesis of structure of MPLS\nnetwork layered with the transport SDH network or WDM and suggests the method\nof its solving. The solving is based on the application of mathematical model\nof multi-layer graph. II, III, IV. Main Part During the planning of MPLS\nnetworks it is necessary to determine the topology of both the networks: that\nof transport one and that of MPLS one. This means that one needs to determine:\n- what nodes of the transport network should support the MPLS functionality; -\nin what way the LSR nodes should be connected via the transport network; - what\nshould be the bandwidth between LSR links. According to the general method for\nsolving the problem of synthesis of multiservice telecommunication systems with\nthe usage of multi-layer graphs, we have to synthesize the initial redundant .\nThe solving of the task above can be reduced to the finding of the multi-layer\nminimum weight subgraph that provides the transfer of information flows with\nthe consideration of the requirements to the structure of the multilayer graph\n[5] and the flows on its edges [6] observed at the applying of constraints to\nthe bandwidth of the edges of the multi-layer graph.

The energy-saving\nconcept studied in this paper is the adaptation of a base station's (BS's)\ntransmit power levels and coverage area according to channel conditions and\ntraffic load. The traffic load in cellular networks exhibits significant\nfluctuations in both space and time, which can be exploited, through cell range\nadaptation, for energy saving. In this paper, we design short- and long-term BS\npower control (STPC and LTPC respectively) policies for the OFDMA-based\ndownlink of a single-cell system, where bandwidth is dynamically and equally\nshared among a random number of mobile users (MUs). STPC is a function of all\nMUs' channel gains that maintains the required user-level quality of service\n(QoS), while LTPC (including BS on-off control) is a function of traffic\ndensity that minimizes the long-term energy consumption at the BS under a\nminimum throughput constraint. We first develop a power scaling law that\nrelates the (short-term) average transmit power at BS with the given cell range\nand MU density. Based on this result, we derive the optimal (long-term)\ntransmit adaptation policy by considering a joint range adaptation and LTPC\nproblem. By identifying the fact that energy saving at BS essentially comes\nfrom two major energy saving mechanisms (ESMs), i.e. range adaptation and BS\non-off power control, we propose low-complexity suboptimal schemes with various\ncombinations of the two ESMs to investigate their impacts on system energy\nconsumption. It is shown that when the network throughput is low, BS on-off\npower control is the most effective ESM, while when the network throughput is\nhigher, range adaptation becomes more effective.\n","Comment: This is the longer version of a paper to appear in IEEE Transactions\n  on Wireless Communications"]}]

These new physics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM\nexpectations for FCNC processes that depends only on the couplings of H^0(A^0)\nto fermions and on their masses. In situations in which a single H^0 or A^0\ndominates NP contributions stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta\nF=1 observables exist.

Once prepared, a cover\nmay be applied to the classification of any given multi-label dataset whose\nproperties conform with those of the cover. The contribution of this paper is\ntwo-fold. First, we introduce SCP as a general framework for constructing label\ncovers while allowing the user to incorporate cover construction constraints.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by proposing two\nconstruction constraints whose enforcement produces covers that improve the\nprediction performance of random selection. Second, we provide theoretical\nbounds that quantify the probabilities of random selection to produce covers\nthat meet the proposed construction criteria. The experimental results indicate\nthat the proposed methods improve multi-label classification accuracy and\nstability compared with the RAKEL algorithm and to other state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.\n"]}]

The\nprocess is to extract knowledge in the form of rules from daily stock\nmovements. These rules can then be used to guide investors. To increase the\nefficiency of the prediction process, Rough Sets is used to discretize the\ndata. The methodology uses a Genetic Algorithm to obtain a structured network\nsuitable for both classification and rule extraction.

The concept of variable mutation operator is introduced for\npreserving the localized structure of the constituting Knowledge Based\nsub-networks, while they are integrated and evolved. Rough Set Dependency Rules\nare generated directly from the real valued attribute table containing Fuzzy\nmembership values. The paradigm is thus used to develop a rule extraction\nalgorithm.

We argue that a\nplayer with the power to define an equilibrium is in a position, where she\nshould not be interested in the symmetry of a Nash equilibrium, and ignore the\nquestion of whether or not her outcome can be improved if the other strategies\nare fixed.

Investigating the Way in Which\n  Lock-in Can Emerge and Affect Cost Overruns"],"description":["  Lock-in, the escalating commitment of decision-makers to an ineffective\ncourse of action, has the potential to explain the large cost overruns in large\nscale transportation infrastructure projects. Lock-in can occur both at the\ndecision-making level (before the decision to build) and at the project level\n(after the decision to build) and can influence the extent of overruns in two\nways. The first involves the methodology of calculating cost overruns according\nto the formal decision to build. Due to lock-in, however, the real decision to\nbuild is made much earlier in the decision-making process and the costs\nestimated at that stage are often much lower than those that are estimated at a\nlater stage in the decision-making process, thus increasing cost overruns. The\nsecond way that lock-in can affect cost overruns is through practice. Although\ndecisions about the project (design and implementation) need to be made,\nlock-in can lead to inefficient decisions that involve higher costs. Sunk costs\n(in terms of both time and money), the need for justification, escalating\ncommitment, and inflexibility and the closure of alternatives are indicators of\nlock-in. In this paper, two case studies, of the Betuweroute and the HSL-South\nprojects in the Netherlands, demonstrate the presence of lock-in and its\ninfluence on the extent of cost overruns at both the decision-making and\nproject levels. This suggests that recognition of lock-in as an explanation for\ncost overruns significantly contributes to the understanding of the inadequate\nplanning process of projects and allows development of more appropriate means.\n"]}]
