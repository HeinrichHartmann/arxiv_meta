Upon a failed\ntransmission of a packet, the network enters cooperation phase, where the\nretransmission of the packets is aided by the relay node. The proposed approach\nintegrates network coding into cooperative ARQ, aiming to improve the network\nthroughput by reducing the number of retransmissions. For successive\nretransmission, three different methods for choosing the retransmitting node\nare considered. The throughput of the methods are analyzed and compared. The\nanalysis is based on binary Markov channel which takes the correlation of the\nchannel coefficients in time into account. Analytical results show that the\nproposed use of network coding result in throughput performance superior to\ntraditional ARQ and cooperative ARQ without network coding. It is also observed\nthat correlation can have significant effect on the performance of the proposed\ncooperative network coded ARQ approach.

An\neffective approach which recently drew a considerable attention in the research\ncommunity is to reweight the training samples to minimize that discrepancy. In\nspecific, many methods are based on developing Density-ratio (DR) estimation\ntechniques that apply to both regression and classification problems. Although\nthese methods work well for regression problems, their performance on\nclassification problems is not satisfactory.

To incorporate the estimated class information of\nthe test data, a soft matching technique is proposed.

The first\nmaximum in the polymerization rate was explained by the decrease of the\ndiffusion rate of macromolecular radicals to the oxygen-rich boundary, an\neffect that starts at low conversions.

In view of this fact, it is clearly of\ninterest to address the question of whether the properties of the clusters have\nchanged between groups of patients and controls. The normal method of\napproaching group differences in brain imaging is to carry out a voxel-wise\nunivariate analysis for a difference between the mean group responses using an\nappropriate test (e.g. a t-test) and to assemble the resulting \"significantly\ndifferent voxels\" into clusters, testing again at cluster level. In this\napproach of course, the primary voxel-level test is blind to any cluster\nstructure. Direct assessments of differences between groups (or reproducibility\nwithin groups) at the cluster level have been rare in brain imaging. For this\nreason, we introduce a novel statistical test called ANOCVA - ANalysis Of\nCluster structure Variability, which statistically tests whether two or more\npopulations are equally clustered using specific features. The proposed method\nallows us to compare the clustering structure of multiple groups\nsimultaneously, and also to identify features that contribute to the\ndifferential clustering.

In the absence of the magnetic field the local and nonlocal resistances\nbehave very similar, which confirms the edge state transport in our system. In\nthe magnetic field, we observe a monotonic decrease of the resistance with\nsaturation of local resistance, while nonlocal resistance disappears\ncompletely, independent of the gate voltage.

Achieving the task requires performing a von Neumann\nmeasurement, which projects a pair of factorized qubits randomly onto one of\nthe four Bell states. In this work we propose a similar scheme, by performing\nthe same Bell-von Neumann measurement over two local qubits, each one initially\nbeing correlated through an X-state with a spatially distant qubit. This\nprocess swaps the X-feature without conditions, whereas the input entanglement\nis partially distributed in the four possible outcome states under certain\nconditions. Specifically, we obtain two threshold values for the input\nentanglement in order for the outcome states to be nonseparable. Besides, we\nfind that there are two possible amounts of outcome entanglement, one is\ngreater and the other less than the input entanglement; the probability of\nobtaining the greatest outcome entanglement is smaller than the probability of\nachieving the least one.
