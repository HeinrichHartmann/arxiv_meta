The main results are the following: (1) If the\nmagnetosphere of the star corotates approximately with the inner disc, then we\nobserve a strong one-armed bending wave (a warp). This warp corotates with the\nstar and has a maximum amplitude between corotation radius and the radius of\nthe vertical resonance. The disc's center of mass can deviate from the\nequatorial plane up to the distance of z_w\\approx 0.1 r. However, the effective\nheight of the warp can be larger, h_w \\approx 0.3 r due to the finite thickness\nof the disc. Stars with a range of misalignment angles excite warps. However,\nthe amplitude of the warps is larger for misalignment angles between 15 and 60\ndegrees. (2) If the magnetosphere rotates slower, than the inner disc, then a\nbending wave is excited at the disc-magnetosphere boundary, but does not form a\nlarge-scale warp. Instead, high-frequency oscillations become strong at the\ninner region of the disc. These are (a) trapped density waves which form inside\nthe radius where the disc angular velocity has a maximum, and (b) inner bending\nwaves which appear in the case of accretion through magnetic Raleigh-Taylor\ninstability. These two types of waves are connected with the inner disc and\ntheir frequencies will vary with accretion rate. Bending oscillations at lower\nfrequencies are also excited including global oscillations of the disc. In\ncases where the simulation region is small, slowly-precessing warp forms.\nSimulations are applicable to young stars, cataclysmic variables, and accreting\nmillisecond pulsars.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 25 figures"]}]

The Lorenz gauge solution is found via\ngauge transformation from a corresponding one in Regge-Wheeler gauge. Like the\nRegge-Wheeler gauge solution itself, the gauge generator is computed in the\nfrequency domain and transferred to the time domain. The wave equation for the\ngauge generator has a source with a compact, moving delta-function term and a\ndiscontinuous non-compact term. The former term allows the method of extended\nhomogeneous solutions to be applied (which circumvents the Gibbs phenomenon).\nThe latter has required the development of new means to use frequency domain\nmethods and yet be able to transfer to the time domain while avoiding Gibbs\nproblems. Two new methods are developed to achieve this: a partial annihilator\nmethod and a method of extended particular solutions. We detail these methods\nand show their application in calculating the odd-parity gauge generator and\nLorenz gauge metric perturbations.

Model parameters of the material were\nchosen to fit a typical polar organic photoconductor polycarbonate doped with\n30% of aromatic hydrazone, whose transport properties are well documented in\nliterature. Simulated carrier mobility demonstrates a usual Poole-Frenkel field\ndependence and its slope is very close to the experimental value without using\nany adjustable parameter. At room temperature transients are universal with\nrespect to the electric field and transport layer thickness. At the same time,\ncarrier mobility does not depend on the layer thickness and transients develop\na well-defined plateau where the current does not depend on time, thus\ndemonstrating a non-dispersive transport regime. Tails of the transients decay\nas power law with the exponent close to -2. This particular feature indicates\nthat transients are close to the boundary between dispersive and non-dispersive\ntransport regimes. Shapes of the simulated transients are in very good\nagreement with the experimental ones. In summary, we provide a first\nverification of a self-consistency of the dipolar glass transport model, where\nmajor transport parameters, extracted from the experimental transport data, are\nthen used in the transport simulation, and the resulting mobility field\ndependence and transients are in very good agreement with the initial\nexperimental data.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Allowing for melting/freezing at one or both of the boundaries of the\nsolid layer is likely to affect the pattern of convection in the layer. We\nstudy here the onset of thermal convection in a viscous spherical shell with\ndynamically induced melting/freezing at either or both of its boundaries. It is\nshown that the behavior of each interface depends on the value of a dimensional\nnumber P, which is the ratio of a melting/freezing timescale over a viscous\nrelaxation timescale. A small value of P corresponds to permeable boundary\nconditions, while a large value of P corresponds to impermeable boundary\nconditions. The linear stability analysis predicts a significant effect of\nsemi-permeable boundaries when the number P characterizing either of the\nboundary is small enough: allowing for melting/freezing at either of the\nboundary results in the emergence of larger scale convective modes. The effect\nis particularly drastic when the outer boundary is permeable, since the degree\n1 mode remains the most unstable even in the case of thin spherical shells. In\nthe case of a spherical shell with permeable inner and outer boundaries, the\nmost unstable mode consists in a global translation of the solid shell, with no\ndeformation. In the limit of a full sphere with permeable outer boundary, this\ncorresponds to the \"convective translation\" mode recently proposed for Earth's\ninner core. As an example of possible application, we discuss the case of\nthermal convection in Enceladus' ice shell assuming the presence of a global\nsubsurface ocean, and found that melting/freezing could have an important\neffect on the pattern of convection in the ice shell.\n"]}]

In addition, the unidirectional\nlaminates may not be available for testing. In such cases, full-field\ndisplacement measurements offer the potential of identifying several material\nproperties simultaneously. For that, it is desirable to create complex\ndisplacement fields that are strongly influenced by all the elastic constants.\nIn this work, we explore the potential of using a laminated plate with an\nopen-hole under traction loading to achieve that and identify all four ply\nelastic constants (E 1, E 2, 12, G 12) at once. However, the accuracy of the\nidentified properties may not be as good as properties measured from individual\ntests due to the complexity of the experiment, the relative insensitivity of\nthe measured quantities to some of the properties and the various possible\nsources of uncertainty. It is thus important to quantify the uncertainty (or\nconfidence) with which these properties are identified. Here, Bayesian\nidentification is used for this purpose, because it can readily model all the\nuncertainties in the analysis and measurements, and because it provides the\nfull coupled probability distribution of the identified material properties. In\naddition, it offers the potential to combine properties identified based on\nsubstantially different experiments. The full-field measurement is obtained by\nmoir\\'e interferometry. For computational efficiency the Bayesian approach was\napplied to a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the displacement fields.\nThe analysis showed that the four orthotropic elastic constants are determined\nwith quite different confidence levels as well as with significant correlation.\nComparison with manufacturing specifications showed substantial difference in\none constant, and this conclusion agreed with earlier measurement of that\nconstant by a traditional four-point bending test. It is possible that the POD\napproach did not take full advantage of the copious data provided by the full\nfield measurements, and for that reason that data is provided for others to use\n(as on line material attached to the article).\n"]}]

The basic version of MABA, namely SABA, combines a\nself-avoiding label propagation technique with a simulated annealing strategy\nfor ant diffusion in networks. Once the communities are found by SABA, this\nmethod can be reapplied to a higher level network where each obtained community\nis regarded as a new vertex. The aforementioned process is repeated\niteratively, and this corresponds to MABA. Thanks to the intrinsic multi-level\nnature of our algorithm, it possesses the potential ability to unfold\nmulti-scale hierarchical structures. Furthermore, MABA has the ability that\nmitigates the resolution limit of modularity. The proposed MABA has been\nevaluated on both computer-generated benchmarks and widely used real-world\nnetworks, and has been compared with a set of competitive algorithms.\nExperimental results demonstrate that MABA is both effective and efficient (in\nnear linear time with respect to the size of network) for discovering\ncommunities.\n","Comment: 18 pages,7 figures, 4 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:0803.0476, arXiv:cond-mat/0309508 by other authors"]}]
