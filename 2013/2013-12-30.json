The logic combines the simplicity of multi-agent modal\nlogic with some powers of monadic second-order quantification. We present a\nsound and complete axiomatization of multi-agent refinement modal logic. We\nalso present an extension of the logic to the modal mu-calculus, and an\naxiomatization for the single-agent version of this logic. Examples and\napplications are also discussed: to software verification and design (the set\nof agents can also be seen as a set of actions), and to dynamic epistemic\nlogic. We further give detailed results on the complexity of satisfiability,\nand on succinctness.\n"]}]

Binding specificity has a strong impact on the evolution of\ngene expression, because it determines how easily regulatory interactions are\ngained and lost. Nevertheless, we have a relatively poor understanding of what\nevolutionary forces determine the specificity of binding sites. Here we address\nthis question by studying regulatory modules composed of multiple binding\nsites. Using a population-genetic model, we show that more complex regulatory\nmodules, composed of a greater number of binding sites, must employ binding\nsites that are individually less specific, compared to less complex regulatory\nmodules. This effect is extremely general, and it hold regardless of the\nregulatory logic of a module. We attribute this phenomenon to the inability of\nstabilising selection to maintain highly specific sites in large regulatory\nmodules. Our analysis helps to explain broad empirical trends in the yeast\nregulatory network: those genes with a greater number of transcriptional\nregulators feature by less specific binding sites, and there is less variance\nin their specificity, compared to genes with fewer regulators. Likewise, our\nresults also help to explain the well-known trend towards lower specificity in\nthe transcription factor binding sites of higher eukaryotes, which perform\ncomplex regulatory tasks, compared to prokaryotes.\n"]}]

Codes with symmetry, especially\ncyclic codes, play an essential role in both theory and practical applications\nof classical error-correcting codes. Here we examine symmetry properties for\ncodeword stabilized (CWS) quantum codes, which is the most general framework\nfor constructing quantum error-correcting codes known to date. A CWS code Q can\nbe represented by a self-dual additive code S and a classical code C, i.,e.,\nQ=(S,C), however this representation is in general not unique. We show that for\nany CWS code Q with certain permutation symmetry, one can always find a\nself-dual additive code S with the same permutation symmetry as Q such that\nQ=(S,C). As many good CWS codes have been found by starting from a chosen S,\nthis ensures that when trying to find CWS codes with certain permutation\nsymmetry, the choice of S with the same symmetry will suffice. A key step for\nthis result is a new canonical representation for CWS codes, which is given in\nterms of a unique decomposition as union stabilizer codes. For CWS codes, so\nfar mainly the standard form (G,C) has been considered, where G is a graph\nstate. We analyze the symmetry of the corresponding graph of G, which in\ngeneral cannot possess the same permutation symmetry as Q. We show that it is\nindeed the case for the toric code on a square lattice with translational\nsymmetry, even if its encoding graph can be chosen to be translational\ninvariant.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 1 figure.

The avalanches,\npotentially harmful for superconductor-based devices, can be suppressed by an\nadjacent normal metal layer, even when the two layers are not in thermal\ncontact. The suppression of the avalanches in this case is due to so-called\nmagnetic braking, caused by eddy currents generated in the metal layer by\npropagating magnetic flux. We develop a theory of magnetic braking by analyzing\ncoupled electrodynamics and heat flow in a superconductor-normal metal bilayer.\nThe equations are solved by linearization and by numerical simulation of the\navalanche dynamics. We find that in an uncoated superconductor, even a uniform\nthermomagnetic instability can develop into a dendritic flux avalanche. The\nmechanism is that a small non-uniformity caused by the electromagnetic\nnon-locality induces a flux-flow hot spot at a random position. The hot spot\nquickly develops into a finger, which at high speeds penetrates into the\nsuperconductor, forming a branching structure. Magnetic braking slows the\navalanches, and if the normal metal conductivity is sufficiently high, it can\nsuppress the formation of the dendritic structure. During avalanches, the\nbraking by the normal metal layer prevents the temperature from exceeding the\ntransition temperature of the superconductor. Analytical criteria for the\ninstability threshold are developed using the linear stability analysis. The\ncriteria are found to match quantitatively the instability onsets obtained in\nsimulation.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures"]}]

An early formulation of the genome assembly problem showed that\ngenome reconstruction is NP-hard when framed as finding the shortest sequence\nthat contains all observed reads. Although this original formulation is very\nsimplistic and does not allow for mate-pair information, subsequent\nformulations have also proven to be NP-hard, and/or may not be guaranteed to\nreturn a correct assembly.\n  In this paper, we provide an alternate perspective on the genome assembly\nproblem by showing genome assembly is easy when provided with sufficient\nmate-pair information. Moreover, we quantify the number of mate-pair libraries\nnecessary and sufficient for accurate genome assembly, in terms of the length\nof the longest repetitive region within a genome. In our analysis, we consider\nan idealized sequencing model where each mate-pair library generates pairs of\nerror free reads with a fixed and known insert size at each position in the\ngenome.\n  Even in this idealized model, we show that accurate genome reconstruction\ncannot be guaranteed in the worst case unless at least roughly R/2L mate-pair\nlibraries are produced, where R is the length of the longest repetitive region\nin the genome and L is the length of each read. On the other hand, if (R/L)+1\nmate-pair libraries are provided, then a simple algorithm can be used to find a\ncorrect genome assembly easily in polynomial time. Although (R/L)+1 mate-pair\nlibraries can be too much to produce in practice, the previous bounds only hold\nin the worst case.

The paper culminates in the theory of co-relative\nhistories and kinematic schemes, combining the causal metric hypothesis, the\nhistories approach to quantum theory, and Grothendieck's relative viewpoint.\nThis leads to the derivation of causal Schr\\\"odinger-type equations as\ndynamical laws for discrete quantum spacetime.\n","Comment: 151 pages, 34 figures; topical outline reformatted to improve\n  internal hyperlinks; footnotes added in section 6; theorem 5.1.6 removed due\n  to error; theorems 5.1.2 and 5.1.4 extended; two figures added to section\n  5.1, missing fourth-generation set added to figure 6.4.1"]}]

The ability to fabricate\nmetamaterials has sparked an interest in determining possible applications. We\ninvestigate using a metamaterial for boundary engineering in waveguides.\n  A metamaterial-clad cylindrical waveguide is used to provide confinement for\nan optical signal, thereby increasing the local electromagnetic energy density.\nWe show that metamaterial-clad waveguides have unique optical properties,\nincluding new modes, which we call hybrid modes. These modes have properties of\nboth ordinary guided modes and surface plasmon-polariton modes.\n  We show that for certain metamaterial parameters, the surface\nplasmon-polariton modes of a metamaterial-clad waveguide have less propagation\nloss than those of a metal-clad guide with the same permittivity. This low-loss\nmode is exploited for all-optical control of weak fields. Embedding three-level\n{\\Lambda} atoms in the dielectric core of a metamaterial-clad waveguide allows\nthe use of electromagnetically induced transparency to control an optical\nsignal.

OFDM\nsignaling can obviate the need for tight time synchronization among multiple\nsimultaneous transmissions in the uplink of PNC systems. However, OFDM PNC\nsystems are susceptible to phase drifts caused by residual carrier frequency\noffsets (CFOs). In the traditional OFDM system in which a receiver receives\nfrom only one transmitter, pilot tones are employed to aid phase tracking. In\nOFDM PNC systems, multiple transmitters transmit to a receiver, and these pilot\ntones must be shared among the multiple transmitters. This reduces the number\nof pilots that can be used by each transmitting node. Phase tracking in OFDM\nPNC is more challenging as a result. To overcome the degradation due to the\nreduced number of per-node pilots, this work supplements the pilots with the\nchannel information contained in the data. In particular, we propose to solve\nthe problems of phase tracking and channel decoding jointly.

How to provide valuable recommendations to viewers is an\nimportant task for both video websites and related third parties, such as\nsearch engines. Previous work conducted numerous analysis on the view counts of\nvideos, which measure a video's value in terms of popularity. However, the\nlong-lasting value of an online video, namely longevity, is hidden behind the\nhistory that a video accumulates its \"popularity\" through time. Generally\nspeaking, a longevous video tends to constantly draw society's attention.

Evaluating a video's\nlongevity can not only improve a video recommender system, but also help us to\ndiscover videos having greater advertising value, as well as adjust a video\nwebsite's strategy of storing videos to shorten its responding time. In order\nto accurately quantify longevity, we introduce the concept of latent social\nimpulses and how to use them measure a video's longevity. In order to derive\nlatent social impulses, we view the video website as a digital signal filter\nand formulate the task as a convex minimization problem. The proposed longevity\ncomputation is based on the derived social impulses. Unfortunately, the\nrequired information to derive social impulses are not always public, which\nmakes a third party unable to directly evaluate every video's longevity. To\nsolve this problem, we formulate a semi-supervised learning task by using part\nof videos having known longevity scores to predict the unknown longevity\nscores.

Graphs are used to represent data in many application areas,\nand they are subjected to various computational algorithms in order to acquire\nthe desired information. These graph algorithms tend to have common\ncharacteristics, such as duplicate detection to guarantee their termination,\nindependent of their application domain. Over the past few years, it has been\nshown that the scalability of such algorithms can be dramatically improved by\nusing, e.g., external memory, by exploiting parallel architectures, such as\nclusters, multi-core CPUs, and graphics processing units, and by using\nheuristics to guide the search. Novel techniques to further scale graph search\nalgorithms, and new applications of graph search are within the scope of this\nworkshop.\n  Another topic of interest of the event is more related to the structural\nproperties of graphs: which kind of graph characteristics are relevant for a\nparticular application area, and how can these be measured? Finally, any novel\nway of using graphs for a particular application area is on topic.\n  The goal of this event is to gather scientists from different communities,\nsuch as model checking, artificial intelligence planning, game playing, and\nalgorithm engineering, who do research on graph search algorithms, such that\nawareness of each others' work is increased.\n"]}]

It is observed that this strategy may cause significant performance\ndegradation in the presence of a dense deployment of RUs with a well connected\nbackhaul network. To obviate this problem, a scheme is proposed in which each\nRU decompresses the received bit streams and performs linear in-network\nprocessing of the decompressed signals.

Recognizing the significant demands of the optimal solution of the\nDPR scheme in terms of channel state information (CSI) at the RUs,\ndecentralized optimization algorithms are proposed under the assumption of\nlimited CSI at the RUs.
