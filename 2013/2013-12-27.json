One crucial problem in big data\nanalytics is the selection of representative instances from large and\nmassively-distributed data, which is formally known as the Column Subset\nSelection (CSS) problem. The solution to this problem enables data analysts to\nunderstand the insights of the data and explore its hidden structure. The\nselected instances can also be used for data preprocessing tasks such as\nlearning a low-dimensional embedding of the data points or computing a low-rank\napproximation of the corresponding matrix. This paper presents a fast and\naccurate greedy algorithm for large-scale column subset selection. The\nalgorithm minimizes an objective function which measures the reconstruction\nerror of the data matrix based on the subset of selected columns. The paper\nfirst presents a centralized greedy algorithm for column subset selection which\ndepends on a novel recursive formula for calculating the reconstruction error\nof the data matrix. The paper then presents a MapReduce algorithm which selects\na few representative columns from a matrix whose columns are massively\ndistributed across several commodity machines. The algorithm first learns a\nconcise representation of all columns using random projection, and it then\nsolves a generalized column subset selection problem at each machine in which a\nsubset of columns are selected from the sub-matrix on that machine such that\nthe reconstruction error of the concise representation is minimized. The paper\ndemonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm through\nan empirical evaluation on benchmark data sets.\n","Comment: Under consideration for publication in Knowledge and Information\n  Systems"]}]
