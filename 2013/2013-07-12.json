In this paper, we study the trapping problem in a family of\nproposed directed fractals with a deep trap at a central node. The directed\nfractals are a generalization of previous undirected fractals by introducing\nthe directed edge weights dominated by a parameter.

The uncertainty in the degree to which radiation-driven winds of hot\nstars might be affected by small inhomogeneities in the density leads to a\ncorresponding uncertainty in the determination of the atmospheric mass loss\nrates from the strength of optical recombination lines. Furthermore, the\noptical recombination lines also react sensitively to even small changes in the\ndensity structure resulting from the (often assumed instead of computed)\nvelocity law of the outflow. This raises the question of how reliable the\nparameter determinations from such lines are.\n  Results. The discrepancy between the optical and the UV analyses is confirmed\nto be the result of a missing consistency between stellar and wind parameters\nin the optical analysis. The influence of the density (velocity field) is of\nthe same order as that of moderate clumping factors. Moderate clumping factors\nleave the UV spectra mostly unaffected, indicating that the influence on the\nionization balance, and thus on the radiative acceleration, is small. Instead\nof the erratic behavior of the clumping factors claimed from the optical\nanalyses, our analysis based on the velocity field computed from radiative\ndriving yields similar clumping factors for all CSPNs. The shock temperatures\nand the ratios of X-ray to bolometric luminosity required to reproduce the\nhighly ionized Ovi line agree with those known from massive O stars, again\nconfirming the similarity of O-type CSPN and massive O star atmospheres.\n  Conclusions. The similarity of the winds of O-type CSPNs and those of massive\nO stars justifies using the same methods based on the dynamics of\nradiation-driven winds in their analysis, thus supporting the earlier result\nthat several of the CSPNs in the sample have near-Chandrasekhar-limit masses\nand may thus be possible single-star progenitors of type Ia supernovae.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 18 figures.

Low power design reduces\ncooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems.\nMoreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power\ndissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since\ndynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd,\nlowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold\nvoltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance.

The geometry of MD-Lasso is key to its consistency and robustness.\nThe estimator is governed by a scaling parameter that caps the influence of\noutliers: the loss per observation is locally convex and close to quadratic for\nsmall squared residuals, and flattens for squared residuals larger than the\nscaling parameter. As the parameter approaches infinity, the estimator becomes\nequivalent to least-squares Lasso.
