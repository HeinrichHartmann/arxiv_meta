In 3-dimensional space, this leads to a variation in\nPlanck constant \\hbar and speed of light c. They vary as \\hbar ~ a^(1/2) and c\n~ a^(-1/2), a is the local scale. A direct consequence is that the expanding\nuniverse progressively alters the values of c which in turn affects the\nevolution of the universe itself. Friedmann eqns violate scale invariance and\nneglect to account for the scale dependency of c. We build a cosmological model\nwhich is fully consistent with scale invariance and respects Lorentz\ninvariance. This model leads to a universe different from the ones depicted in\nFriedmann model. We apply our model to resolve a series of observational and\ntheoretical difficulties in modern cosmology: \"runaway density parameter\"\nproblem, budgetary shortfall, horizon problem, eg. Our model does not resort to\ninflation hypothesis. We derive a modification to the Hubble law and Hubble\nconstant, and a new brightness-redshift relationship for Type Ia supernovae:\n(a) Hubble constant has been inadvertently overestimated by a factor of 9/5; so\nhas the critical density by (9/5)^2; (b) Our new photometric distance-redshift\nrelationship d_L=2c/(3H0)*(1+z)^(5/6)\\ln(1+z) with one parameter H0=37 fits to\nthe high-$z$ objects as equally well as the traditional relationship does with\nthree parameters H0=70.5, OmegaM=0.27, OmegaL=0.73.

Our stacked images reach $5\\sigma$ $AB$ depths\nin an aperture of $2\\arcsec$ diameter of $\\sim 25$ in $Y$ and $\\sim 24$ in\n$JHK_{\\rm s}$ bands and all have sub-arcsecond seeing. To this $5\\sigma$ limit,\nour $K_{\\rm s}$ catalogue contains 216,268 sources. We carry out a series of\nquality assessment tests on our images and catalogues, comparing our stacks\nwith existing catalogues. The $1\\sigma$ astrometric RMS in both directions for\nstars selected with $17.0<K_{\\rm s}\\rm {(AB)} <19.5$ is $\\sim 0.08\\arcsec$ in\ncomparison to the publicly-available COSMOS ACS catalogues. Our images are\nresampled to the same pixel scale and tangent point as the publicly available\nCOSMOS data and so may be easily used to generate multi-colour catalogues using\nthis data. All images and catalogues presented in this paper are publicly\navailable through ESO's \"phase 3\" archiving and distribution system and from\nthe UltraVISTA web site.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 15 figures, updated to match published version.

Using generalized Taylor dispersion theory, we develop a\npopulation-level swimming-advection-diffusion model for suspensions of\nmicro-organisms in a vertical pipe flow. In particular, a combination of\ngravitational and viscous torques acting on individual cells can affect their\nswimming behaviour, which is termed gyrotaxis. This typically leads to local\ncell drift and diffusion in a suspension of cells. In a flow in a pipe, small\namounts of radial drift across streamlines can have a major impact on the\neffective axial drift and diffusion of the cells. We present a Galerkin method\nto calculate the local mean swimming velocity and diffusion tensor based on\nlocal shear for arbitrary flow rates. This method is validated with asymptotic\nresults obtained in the limits of weak and strong shear. We solve the resultant\nswimming-advection-diffusion equation using numerical methods for the case of\nimposed Poiseuille flow and investigate how the flow modifies the dispersion of\nactive swimmers from that of passive scalars. We establish that generalized\nTaylor dispersion theory predicts an enhancement of gyrotactic focussing in\npipe flow with increasing shear strength, in contrast to earlier models. We\nalso show that biased swimming cells may behave very differently to passive\ntracers, drifting axially at up to twice the rate and diffusing much less.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Far from the Galactic plane (|b| > 30 degrees), the observed\ngamma-ray emission is nearly invariant with latitude, and is consistent with\narising from inverse Compton scattering of the interstellar radiation field by\ncosmic-ray electrons with an approximately power-law spectrum. The same\nelectrons in the presence of microgauss-scale magnetic fields can also generate\nthe the observed microwave \"haze\". At lower latitudes (b < 20 degrees), in\ncontrast, the spectrum of the emission correlated with the Bubbles possesses a\npronounced spectral feature peaking at 1-4 GeV (in E^2 dN/dE) which cannot be\ngenerated by any realistic spectrum of electrons. Instead, we conclude that a\nsecond (non-inverse-Compton) emission mechanism must be responsible for the\nbulk of the low-energy, low-latitude emission. This second component is\nspectrally similar to the excess GeV emission previously reported from the\nGalactic Center (GC), and also appears spatially consistent with a luminosity\nper volume falling approximately as r^-2.4, where r is the distance from the\nGC. We argue that the spectral feature visible in the low-latitude Bubbles is\nthe extended counterpart of the GC excess, now detected out to at least 2-3 kpc\nfrom the GC. The spectrum and angular distribution of the signal is consistent\nwith that predicted from ~10 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to leptons,\nor from ~50 GeV dark matter particles annihilating to quarks, following a\ndistribution similar to the canonical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile. We\nalso consider millisecond pulsars as a possible astrophysical explanation for\nthe signal, as observed millisecond pulsars possess a spectral cutoff at\napproximately the required energy.

Every\nconsumer gets to test every product in a complete-block design; however, many\nclasses of products do not lend themselves to such approaches because only a\nfew samples can be evaluated before `fatigue' sets in. We consider an analysis\nof incomplete balanced-incomplete-block data on 12 different types of white\nbread. A latent Gaussian mixture model is used for this analysis, with a\npartial expectation-maximization (PEM) algorithm developed for parameter\nestimation. This PEM algorithm circumvents the need for a traditional E-step,\nby performing a partial E-step that reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the conditional distribution of the missing data and the distribution\nof the missing data given the observed data. The results of the white bread\nanalysis are discussed and some mathematical details are given in an appendix.\n"]}]

The model describes a crystal surface\nby assigning a non-negative integer height $\\eta_x$ to each site $x$ in the box\nand 0 heights to its boundary. The probability of a surface configuration\n$\\eta$ is proportional to $\\exp(-\\beta \\mathcal{H}(\\eta))$, where $\\beta$ is\nthe inverse-temperature and $\\mathcal{H}(\\eta)$ sums the absolute values of\nheight differences between neighboring sites.\n  We give a full description of the shape of the SOS surface for low enough\ntemperatures. First we show that with high probability the height of almost all\nsites is concentrated on two levels, $H(L)=\\lfloor (1/4\\beta)\\log L\\rfloor$ and\n$H(L)-1$. Moreover, for most values of $L$ the height is concentrated on the\nsingle value $H(L)$. Next, we study the ensemble of level lines corresponding\nto the heights $(H(L),H(L)-1,...)$. We prove that w.h.p. there is a unique\nmacroscopic level line for each height. Furthermore, when taking a diverging\nsequence of system sizes $L_k$, the rescaled macroscopic level line at height\n$H(L_k)-n$ has a limiting shape if the fractional parts of $(1/4\\beta)\\log L_k$\nconverge to a noncritical value. The scaling limit is an explicit convex subset\nof the unit square $Q$ and its boundary has a flat component on the boundary of\n$Q$. Finally, the highest macroscopic level line has $L_k^{1/3+o(1)}$\nfluctuations along the flat part of the boundary of its limiting shape.\n","Comment: 54 pages, 8 figures"]}]

In this paper, we propose and analyze the\nframework of ensemble sparse models, and demonstrate their utility in image\nrestoration and unsupervised clustering. The proposed ensemble model\napproximates the data as a linear combination of approximations from multiple\n\\textit{weak} sparse models. Theoretical analysis of the ensemble model reveals\nthat even in the worst-case, the ensemble can perform better than any of its\nconstituent individual models. The dictionaries corresponding to the individual\nsparse models are obtained using either random example selection or boosted\napproaches. Boosted approaches learn one dictionary per round such that the\ndictionary learned in a particular round is optimized for the training examples\nhaving high reconstruction error in the previous round. Results with compressed\nrecovery show that the ensemble representations lead to a better performance\ncompared to using a single dictionary obtained with the conventional\nalternating minimization approach. The proposed ensemble models are also used\nfor single image superresolution, and we show that they perform comparably to\nthe recent approaches.
