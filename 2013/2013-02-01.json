As there may be many answers to this\nquestion, we isolate a necessary condition, the SPASs property, that should be\nsatisfied by any reasonable notion of SPASs. This requires that if two theories\nconform to a common notion of SPASs, with one a subtheory of the other, and are\nisomorphic in some particular spacetime, then they should be isomorphic in all\nglobally hyperbolic spacetimes (of given dimension). The SPASs property is\nformulated in a functorial setting broad enough to describe general physical\ntheories describing processes in spacetime, subject to very minimal\nassumptions. By explicit constructions, the full class of locally covariant\ntheories is shown not to satisfy the SPASs property, establishing that there is\nno notion of SPASs encompassing all such theories. It is also shown that all\nlocally covariant theories obeying the time-slice property possess two local\nsubstructures, one kinematical (obtained directly from the functorial\nstructure) and the other dynamical (obtained from a natural form of dynamics,\ntermed relative Cauchy evolution). The covariance properties of relative Cauchy\nevolution and the kinematic and dynamical substructures are analyzed in detail.\nCalling local covariant theories dynamically local if their kinematical and\ndynamical local substructures coincide, it is shown that the class of\ndynamically local theories fulfills the SPASs property.

Recently, a two-dimensional model\n(triangular lattice) where doubly and triply visited sites are given different\nweights was shown to display a rich phase diagram with first and second order\ncollapse separated by a multi-critical point. A kinetic growth process of\ntrails (KGT) was conjectured to map precisely to this multi-critical point.

Unfortunately, the state spaces of complex processes are very\nlarge, making an explicit representation of a belief state intractable. Even in\ndynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), where the process itself can be represented\ncompactly, the representation of the belief state is intractable.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a quality of monitoring (QoM) metric defined by the expected number\nof active users monitored, and investigate the problem of maximizing QoM by\njudiciously assigning sniffers to channels based on the knowledge of user\nactivities in a multi-channel wireless network. Two types of capture models are\nconsidered. The user-centric model assumes frame-level capturing capability of\nsniffers such that the activities of different users can be distinguished while\nthe sniffer-centric model only utilizes the binary channel information (active\nor not) at a sniffer. For the user-centric model, we show that the implied\noptimization problem is NP-hard, but a constant approximation ratio can be\nattained via polynomial complexity algorithms. For the sniffer-centric model,\nwe devise stochastic inference schemes to transform the problem into the\nuser-centric domain, where we are able to apply our polynomial approximation\nalgorithms.

Like Lloyd we use the Pool Adjacent Violator\nAlgorithm (PAVA) to construct the estimate of the convex curve. We present a\ndirect proof that this estimate is a convex hull of the empirical ROC curve.\nThe estimate is simple to construct by hand, and follows the suggestions by\nPesce, et~al.~(2010).\n  We examine the properties of this constrained nonparametric maximum\nlikelihood estimator (NPMLE) under a large number of experimental conditions.\nIn particular we examine the behavior of the area under the curve which is\noften used as summary metric of diagnostic performance. This constrained ROC\nestimator gives an area under the curve (AUC) estimate that is biased high with\nrespect to the usual empirical AUC estimate, but may be less biased with\nrespect to the underlying continuous true AUC value. The constrained ROC\nestimator has lower variance than the usual empirical one.
