In this paper, the NVU algorithm\nfor atomic systems is extended to be able to simulate geodesic motion of\nmolecules at constant potential energy. We derive an algorithm for simulating\nrigid bonds and test this algorithm on three different systems: an asymmetric\ndumbbell model, Lewis-Wahnstrom OTP, and rigid SPC/E water.

The rigid-bond NVU algorithm conserves potential energy, bond\nlengths, and step length for indefinitely long runs. The quantities probed in\nsimulations give results identical to those of Nose-Hoover NVT dynamics.

Due to the relations between\nthe adiabatic sound speed and equations of state (EoS)\n$c^2_{s,ad}(a)=w(a)-d\\ln(1+w(a))/3 d\\ln a$, the equation of state can be\ndetermined up to an integration constant in principle when an adiabatic sound\nspeed is given.

Here, a viscosity stratification induced hydrodynamic\ninstability leads to a gentle micro-mixing which results in larger liposome\nsize than when the streams are mixed turbulently. The results are in sharp\ncontrast to a purely diffusive mixing in macroscopic laminar flow that was\nbelieved to occur under these conditions. Further precise quantification of the\nmixing characteristics should provide the insights to develop a general theory\nfor size selection for the class of ethanol injection methods. This will also\nlay grounds for obtaining empirical evidence that will enable better control of\nliposome sizes and for designing drug encapsulation and delivery devices.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 14 Figures"]}]

Each agent wishes to be matched to an agent in the\nother set and has a strict preference over these potential matches. A matching\nis stable if there are no blocking pairs, i.e., no pair of agents that prefer\neach other to their assigned matches. Such a situation is undesirable as it\ncould lead to a deviation in which the blocking pair form a private arrangement\noutside the matching. This however assumes that the blocking pair have social\nties or communication channels to facilitate the deviation. Relaxing the\nstability definition to take account of the potential lack of social ties\nbetween agents can yield larger stable matchings.\n  In this paper, we define the Hospitals/Residents problem under Social\nStability (HRSS) which takes into account social ties between agents by\nintroducing a social network graph to the HR problem. Edges in the social\nnetwork graph correspond to resident-hospital pairs in the HR instance that\nknow one another. Pairs that do not have corresponding edges in the social\nnetwork graph can belong to a matching M but they can never block M. Relative\nto a relaxed stability definition for HRSS, called social stability, we show\nthat socially stable matchings can have different sizes and the problem of\nfinding a maximum socially stable matching is NP-hard, though approximable\nwithin 3/2.

We find that the appropriate notion of model is a special kind of\npromonoidal category. Since the theory of promonoidal categories has not been\ndeveloped very thoroughly, at least in the published literature, we need to\ndevelop it here. The most natural way to do this - and the simplest, once the\n(substantial) groundwork has been laid - is to consider promonoidal categories\nas an instance of the general theory of pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory.\nAccordingly, we describe and explain the notions of monoidal bicategory and\npseudomonoid therein.\n  The higher-dimensional nature of monoidal bicategories presents serious\nnotational difficulties, since to use the natural analogue of the commutative\ndiagrams used in ordinary category theory would require the use of\nthree-dimensional diagrams. We therefore introduce a novel technical device,\nwhich we dub the calculus of components, that simplifies the business of\nreasoning about a certain class of algebraic structure internal to a monoidal\nbicategory. When viewed through this simplifying lens, the theory of\npseudomonoids turns out to be essentially formally identical to the ordinary\ntheory of monoidal categories. We indicate how the calculus of components may\nbe extended to cover structures that make use of the braiding in a braided\nmonoidal bicategory, and use this to study braided pseudomonoids.\n  A higher-dimensional analogue of Cayley's theorem is proved, and used to\ndeduce a novel characterisation of the unit of a promonoidal category. This,\nand the other preceding work, is then used to give two characterisations of the\ncategories that model the unitless fragment of intuitionistic multiplicative\nlinear logic.

The latter's approach to the\nthree-body-problem has often been celebrated as a starting point of chaos\ntheory in relation to the investigation of dynamical systems. Yet, the novelty\nof Poincar\\'e's strategy can also be analyzed as having been cast out some\nspecific algebraic practices for manipulating systems of linear equations. As\nthe structure of a cast-iron building may be less noticeable than its creative\nfa\\c{c}ade, the algebraic cast of Poincar\\'e's strategy was broken out of the\nmold in generating the new methods of celestial mechanics. But as the various\ncomponents that are mixed in some casting process can still be detected in the\nresulting alloy, this algebraic cast points to some collective dimensions of\nthe M\\'ethodes nouvelles. It thus allow to analyze Poincar\\'e's individual\ncreativity in regard with the collective dimensions of some algebraic cultures.\nAt a global scale, Poincar\\'e's strategy is a testimony of the pervading\ninfluence of what used to play the role of a shared algebraic culture in the\n19th century, i.e., much before the development of linear algebra as a specific\ndiscipline. This shared culture was usually identified by references to the\n''equation to the secular inequalities in planetary theory.'' This form of\nidentification highlights the long shadow of the great treatises of mechanics\npublished at the end of the 18th century. At a more local scale, Poincar\\'e's\napproach can be analyzed in regard with the specific evolution that Hermite's\nalgebraic theory of forms impulsed to the culture of the secular equation.\nMoreover, this papers shows that some specific aspects of Poincar\\'e's own\ncreativity result from a process of acculturation of the latter to Jordan's\npractices of reductions of linear substitutions within the local algebraic\nculture anchored in Hermite's legacy .\n"]}]

To solve this problem, Description-centric algorithms such as\nSuffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm have been introduced and used\nsuccessfully and extensively with different adapted versions for English,\nEuropean, and Chinese Languages. However, till the day of writing this paper,\nin our knowledge, STC algorithm has been never applied for Arabic Web Snippets\nSearch Results Clustering.In this paper, we propose first, to study how STC can\nbe applied for Arabic Language? We then illustrate by example that is\nimpossible to apply STC after Arabic Snippets pre-processing (stem or root\nextraction) because the Merging process yields many redundant clusters.\nSecondly, to overcome this problem, we propose to integrate STC in a new scheme\ntaking into a count the Arabic language properties in order to get the web more\nand more adapted to Arabic users. The proposed approach automatically clusters\nthe web search results into high quality, and high significant clusters labels.\nThe obtained clusters not only are coherent, but also can convey the contents\nto the users concisely and accurately. Therefore the Arabic users can decide at\na glance whether the contents of a cluster are of interest.....\n"]}]

The detector is\ncoupled to a massless scalar test field. Due to the Unruh effect, this detector\nbecomes excited even in Minkowski vacuum with a probability proportional to a\nthermal Bose-Einstein distribution at temperature T=a/2pi in the detector's\nenergy gap. This excitation is usually said to happen upon detection of a\nRindler quantum, which is defined by having positive frequency with respect to\nthe detector's proper time instead of inertial time. Using Unruh's fully\nrelativistic detector model, we show that the process involved is in fact\nspontaneous excitation of the detector due to the interaction with the\naccelerating background field E=ma. We explicitly solve the Klein-Gordon\nequation in the presence of a constant background field E and use this result\nto calculate the transition probability for the detector to become excited on\nMinkowski vacuum. This transition probability agrees with the Unruh effect, but\nis obtained without reverting to the concept of Rindler quantization.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures"]}]
