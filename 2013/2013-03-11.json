The distribution of M2+\nand Sb5+ among the two octahedral sites have 3% of disorder for M2+ = Ni2+,\nwhereas for M2+ = Mn2+ and Co2+ less disorder is found. The three samples have\nan antiferromagnetic transition, due to the antiferromagnetic coupling between\nM2+ through super-superexchange paths M2+ - O2- - Sb5+ - O2- - M2+. Transition\ntemperatures are low: 8, 10 and 17 K for Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ respectively, as\na consequence of the relatively long distances between the magnetic ions M2+.\nBesides, for LaPbMnSbO6 a small transition at 45 K was found, with\nferrimagnetic characteristics, possibly as a consequence of a small disorder\nbetween Mn2+ and Sb5+. This disorder would give additional and shorter\ninteraction paths: superexchange Mn2+ - O2- - Mn2+.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures included.

Transfer learning tries to find a common learning machine or a\ncommon feature subspace that is shared by both the source corpus and the target\ncorpus. The denoising deep neural network is used as the learning machine.\nThree transfer techniques, which aim to learn common feature representations,\nare used for analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe transfer learning schemes on the mismatch problem.\n","Comment: This paper has been submitted to the conference \"INTERSPEECH2013\" in\n  March 4, 2013 for review"]}]

Application to the IRAS/PSCz Catalogue"],"description":["  Rhombic cell analysis as outlined in the first paper of the present series is\napplied to samples of varying depths and liming luminosities of the IRAS/PSCz\nCatalogue. Numerical indices are introduced to summarize essential information.\nBecause of the discrete nature of the anlaysis and of the space distribution of\ngalaxies, the indices for a given sample must be regarded as each having an\nirreducible scatter. Despite the scatter, the mean indices show remarkable\nvariations across the samples. The underlying factor for the variations is\nshown to be the limiting luminosity rather than the sampling depth. As samples\nof more and more luminous galaxies are considered over a range of some 2\nmagnitudes (a factor of some 50 in space density), the morpholgy of the filled\nand empty regions the galaxies define degrades steadily towards insignificance,\nand the degrading is faster for the filled than the empty region.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]
