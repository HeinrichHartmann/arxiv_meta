Namely, it is shown that Black-Scholes equation is\ninvariant under Schr\\\"odinger group. In order to do this, the one dimensional\nfree non-relativistic particle and its symmetries are revisited. To get the\nBlack-Scholes equation symmetries, the particle mass is identified as the\ninverse of square of the volatility. Furthermore, using financial variables, a\nSchr\\\"odinger algebra representation is constructed.\n","Comment: 10 page, non figures"]}]
