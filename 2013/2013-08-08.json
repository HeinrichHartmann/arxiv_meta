The relational\nquadrilateral is more useful in these respects than previously investigated\nsimpler RPM's as it possesses linear constraints, nontrivial subsystems and its\nconfiguration space is a nontrivial complex-projective space. In this paper, I\ninvestigate the submanifold of collinear configurations, the submanifolds with\na single-particle collision, the square configurations and regions of the\nconfiguration space for which such as approximate collinearity, approximate\nsquareness and approximate triangularity hold. I consider both mirror image\nidentified and unidentified shapes, as well as both distinguishable and\nindistinguishable particle labels. I find the following CP^2 coordinate systems\nto be useful to these ends. 1) Kuiper's coordinates, which, for\nquadrilateralland, are magnitudes of the Jacobi vectors and anisoscelesnesses\nof the triangles formed between them. 2) Gibbons-Pope type coordinates, which,\nfor quadrilateralland, are the sum and difference of relative angles between\nsubsystems, the ratio of size of 2 subsystems and the proportion of universe\nmodel occupied by the subsystems.\n","Comment: Seminar II on relational quadrilaterals (2-d 4-body problem as a\n  whole-universe model free from absolute structures).

Thus, constraining the near-core conditions in\nthis class of stars can place tighter constraints on the size, mass and\nchemical composition of supernova remnants. Asteroseismology of these massive\nstars is one possible approach into such investigations. Recently, Moravveji et\nal. (2012, hereafter Paper I) extracted 19 significant frequencies from a\n6-year radial velocity monitoring or Rigel (\\beta Ori, B8 Ia). The periods they\ndetermined broadly range from 1.22 to 74.74 days. Based on our differentially\nrotating stellar structure and evolution model, Rigel, at it's current\nevolutionary state, is undergoing core He burning and shell H burning. Linear\nfully non-adiabatic non-radial stability analyses result in the excitation of a\ndense spectrum of non-radial gravity-dominated mixed modes. The fundamental\nradial mode (\\ell=0) and its overtones are all stable. When the hydrogen\nburning shell is located even partially in the radiative zone, a favorable\ncondition for destabilization of g-modes through the so-called\n\\epsilon-mechanism becomes viable. Only those g-modes that have high relative\namplitudes in the hydrogen burning (radiative) zone can survive the strong\nradiative damping. From the entire observed range of variability periods of\nRigel (found in Paper I), and based on our model, only those modes with periods\nranging between 21 to 127 days can be theoretically explained by the\n\\epsilon-mechanism. The origin of the short-period variations (found in Paper\nI) still remain unexplained. Because Rigel is similar to other massive BA\nsupergiants, we believe that the \\epsilon-mechanism may be able to explain the\nlong-period variations in \\alpha Cygni class of pulsating stars.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Predictions of 146Sm and 144Sm\nproduction in the gamma-process in massive stars are at odds with these\nconstraints and this is partly due to deficiences in the prediction of the\nreaction rates involved. The production ratio depends almost exclusively on the\n(gamma,n)/(gamma,alpha) branching at 148Gd. A measurement of\n144Sm(alpha,gamma)148Gd at low energy had discovered considerable discrepancies\nbetween cross section predictions and the data. Although this reaction cross\nsection mainly depends on the optical alpha+nucleus potential, no global\noptical potential has yet been found which can consistently describe the\nresults of this and similar alpha-induced reactions at the low energies\nencountered in astrophysical environments. The untypically large deviation in\n144Sm(alpha,gamma) and the unusual energy dependence can be explained, however,\nby low-energy Coulomb excitation which is competing with compound nucleus\nformation at very low energies. Considering this additional reaction channel,\nthe cross sections can be described with the usual optical potential\nvariations, compatible with findings for (n,alpha) reactions in this mass\nrange. Low-energy (alpha,gamma) and (alpha,n) data on other nuclei can also be\nconsistently explained in this way. Since Coulomb excitation does not affect\nalpha-emission, the 148Gd(gamma,alpha) rate is much higher than previously\nassumed.

Across all model\norganisms the causal mutations have been discovered for only a handful of gene\nexpression adaptations, and even for these, mechanistic details (e.g. the\ntrans-regulatory factors involved) have not been determined. We previously\nreported a polygenic gene expression adaptation involving down-regulation of\nthe ergosterol biosynthesis pathway in the budding yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae.

This down-regulation increases resistance to a widely used\nantifungal drug targeting ergosterol, similar to mutations disrupting this\npathway in clinical yeast isolates. The identification of the causal genetic\nvariant revealed that the selection likely occurred after the deletion was\nalready present at high frequency in the population, rather than when it was a\nnew mutation.

The purpose is to generate arbitrary\nquantum gates corresponding to Xg. This is achieved by the tracking of\nT-periodic reference trajectories that pass by Xg using the framework of\nCoron's Return Method. The T-periodic reference trajectories are generated by\napplying open-loop controls that are a sum of a finite number M of odd\nT-periodic function whose amplitudes are parameterized by a vector. The main\nresult establishes that, for M big enough, X(jT) exponentially converges\ntowards Xg for almost all fixed amplitude vectors, with explicit and completely\nconstructive control laws. This paper also establishes a stochastic version of\nthis deterministic control law. The key idea is to randomly choose a different\namplitude vector at each sampling time jT, and keeping it fixed until the next\nsampling time (j+1)T. It is also shown that X(jT) exponentially converges\ntowards Xg almost surely.

All samples, which\nwere prepared by arc melting, exhibit $L2_1$ long range order over the complete\nrange of Fe concentration. Structural and magnetic properties of\nCo$_2$Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si Heusler alloys were investigated by means of X-ray\ndiffraction, high and low temperature magnetometry, M{\\\"o\\ss}bauer\nspectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The electronic structure\nwas explored by means of high energy photo emission spectroscopy at about 8 keV\nphoton energy. This ensures true bulk sensitivity of the measurements. The\nmagnetization of the Fe doped Heusler alloys is in agreement with the values of\nthe magnetic moments expected for a Slater-Pauling like behavior of\nhalf-metallic ferromagnets. The experimental findings are discussed on the hand\nof self-consistent calculations of the electronic and magnetic structure. To\nachieve good agreement with experiment, the calculations indicate that on-site\nelectron-electron correlation must be taken into account, even at low Fe\nconcentration. The present investigation focuses on searching for the\nquaternary compound where the half-metallic behavior is stable against outside\ninfluences. Overall, the results suggest that the best candidate may be found\nat an iron concentration of about 50%.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 9 figures Phys. Rev. B accepted"]}]

First the notion of a deformation of a noncommutative ringed\nspace over a commutative locally ringed space is introduced within a language\ncoming from Algebraic Geometry and Complex Analysis. Then we define what a\nDirac quantization of a commutative ringed space with a Poisson structure, the\nspace of classical observables, is. Afterwards the normal order quantization of\nthe Poisson space of classical polynomial observables on a cotangent bundle is\nconstructed. By using a complete symbol calculus on manifolds we succeed in\nextending the normal order quantization of polynomial observables to a\nquantization of a Poisson space of symbols on a cotangent bundle. Furthermore\nwe consider functorial properties of these quantizations. Altogether it is\nshown that a deformation theoretical approach to quantization is possible not\nonly in a formal sense but also such that the deformation parameter $\\hbar$ can\nattain any real value.\n","Comment: postscript-file, 70 pages, also available at\n  ftp://ftp.math.tu-berlin.de/pub/Preprints/sfb288/abstract186.html"]}]
