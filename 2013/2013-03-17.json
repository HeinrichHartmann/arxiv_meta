With the rise in development in\ncomputer and internet technology, multimedia data has become the most\nconvenient method for military training. An innovative encryption algorithm for\nvideos compressed using H.264 was proposed to safely exchange highly\nconfidential videos. To maintain a balance between security and computational\ntime, the proposed algorithm shuffles the video frames along with the audio,\nand then AES is used to selectively encrypt the sensitive video codewords.\nUsing this approach unauthorized viewing of the video file can be prevented and\nhence this algorithm provides a high level of security. A comparative study of\nthe proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms has been put forward in\nthis paper to prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n","Comment: Published with International Journal of Computer Applications (IJCA)\n  5 pages 4 images. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1104.0800 by\n  other authors without attribution"]}]
