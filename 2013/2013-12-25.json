The idea of extending quantum\nfield theories to manifolds of lower dimension was first proposed by Dan Freed\nin the nineties. In the case of conformal field theory (CFT), we are talking of\nan extension of the Atiyah-Segal axioms, where one replaces the bordism\ncategory of Riemann surfaces by a suitable bordism bicategory, whose ob jects\nare points, whose morphisms are 1-manifolds, and whose 2-morphisms are pieces\nof Riemann surface. There is a beautiful classification of full (rational) CFTs\ndue to Fuchs, Runkel and Schweigert, which roughly says the following. Fix a\nchiral algebra A (= vertex algebra). Then the set of full cfts whose left and\nright chiral algebras agree with A is classified by Frobenius algebras internal\nto Rep(A). A famous example to which one can successfully apply this is the\ncase where the chiral algebra A is affine su(2) at level k, for some k in N. In\nthat case, the Frobenius algebras in Rep (A) are classified by A_n, D_n, E_6,\nE_7, E_8, and so are the corresponding CFTs. Recently, Kapustin and Saulina\ngave a conceptual interpretation of the FRS classification in terms of\n3-dimensional Chern-Simons theory with defects. Those defects are also given by\nFrobenius algebra ob ject in Rep(A). Inspired by the proposal of Kapustin and\nSaulina, we will (partially) construct the three-tier CFT associated to a\nFrobenius algebra object.\n","Comment: lecture notes, many pictures (published version - minor modifications\n  from v1)"]}]

Using this approach one can solve\nproblems in which the domain under analysis can be selectively discretized\nspatially and temporally, hence allowing the user to obtain a desired level of\naccuracy in critical regions while improving computational efficiency globally.\nThe mathematical background for this approach is largely based upon the\nfundamental principles of domain decomposition methods (DDM) and Lagrange\nmultipliers, used to obtain coupled equations of motion for distinct regions of\na continuous domain. These methods when combined together systematically yield\nconstraint forces that not only ensure conservation of energy but also enforce\ncontinuity of velocities across sub-domain interfaces.

This paper describes the energy calibration of jets\nperformed with photon+jet, Z+jet and dijet{} events, with jet transverse\nmomentum pT > 6 GeV and pseudorapidity range |eta| < 3.6. The corrections are\nmeasured separately for data and simulation, achieving a precision of 1.4%-1.8%\nfor jets in the central part of the calorimeter and up to 3.5% for the jets\nwith pseudorapidity |eta| = 3.0. Specific corrections are extracted to enhance\nthe description of jet energy in simulation and in particular of the effects\ndue to the flavor of the parton originating the jet, correcting biases up to\n3%-4% in jets with low pT originating from gluons and up to 6%-8% in jets from\nb quarks.\n","Comment: 44 pages, 42 figures.
