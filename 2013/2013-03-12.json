Higher homotopies\nwere isolated within algebraic topology at least as far back as the 1940's.\nPrompted by the failure of the Alexander-Whitney multiplication of cocycles to\nbe commutative, Steenrod developed certain operations which measure this\nfailure in a coherent manner. Dold and Lashof extended Milnor's classifying\nspace construction to associative H-spaces, and a careful examination of this\nextension led Stasheff to the discovery of An-spaces and Ainfty-spaces as\nnotions which control the failure of associativity in a coherent way so that\nthe classifying space construction can still be pushed through. Algebraic\nversions of higher homotopies have, as we all know, led Kontsevich eventually\nto the proof of the formality conjecture. Homological perturbation theory\n(HPT), in a simple form first isolated by Eilenberg and Mac Lane in the early\n1950's, has nowadays become a standard tool to handle algebraic incarnations of\nhigher homotopies. A basic observation is that higher homotopy structures\nbehave much better relative to homotopy than strict structures, and HPT enables\none to exploit this observation in various concrete situations which, in\nparticular, leads to the effective calculation of various invariants which are\notherwise intractable. Higher homotopies abound but they are rarely recognized\nexplicitly and their significance is hardly understood; at times, their\nappearance might at first glance even come as a surprise, for example in the\nKodaira-Spencer approach to deformations of complex manifolds or in the theory\nof foliations.\n","Comment: 14 pages, expanded version of a talk delivered at the meeting \"Higher\n  structures in Geometry and Physics\", IHP, Paris, January 15-19, 2007, in\n  honor of Murray Gerstenhaber's 80th and Jim Stasheff's 70th birthday"]}]

Combining density functional theory (DFT)\nsimulations with the experimental characterization of thin films, we show that\niron is in the Fe3+ oxidation state and accordingly that the films are rich in\noxygen vacancies (VO). VO favor the formation of the tetragonal phase in doped\nzirconia (ZrO2:Fe) and affect the density of state at the Fermi level as well\nas the local magnetization of Fe atoms. We also show that the Fe(2p) and Fe(3p)\nenergy levels can be used as a marker for the presence of vacancies in the\ndoped system. In particular the computed position of the Fe(3p) peak is\nstrongly sensitive to the VO to Fe atoms ratio. A comparison of the theoretical\nand experimental Fe(3p) peak position suggests that in our films this ratio is\nclose to 0.5. Besides the interest in the material by itself, ZrO2:Fe\nconstitutes a test case for the application of DFT on transition metals\nembedded in oxides. In ZrO2:Fe the inclusion of the Hubbard U correction\nsignificantly changes the electronic properties of the system.

The reactions are treated as\nbirth-death processes and the first stage of the derivation is at the single\nparticle level, taking into account the death process, whilst the second stage\nconsiders an ensemble of these particles including the birth process. Using\nthis model we have investigated different types of pattern formation across the\nvertices on a range of networks. Importantly, the CTRW defines the Laplacian\noperator on the network in a non \\emph{ad-hoc} manner and the pattern formation\ndepends on the structure of this Laplacian. Here we focus attention on CTRWs\nwith exponential waiting times for two cases; one in which the rate parameter\nis constant for all vertices and the other where the rate parameter is\nproportional to the vertex degree. This results in nonsymmetric and symmetric\nCTRW Laplacians respectively. In the case of symmetric Laplacians, pattern\nformation follows from the Turing instability. However in nonsymmetric\nLaplacians, pattern formation may be possible with or without a Turing\ninstability.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 10 figures"]}]

In this non-relativistic\nlimit, baryons are composed of N_c quarks that interact, at leading order in\nN_c, through a color Coulomb potential. Using variational techniques, very\naccurate calculations of single baryon masses and interaction energies of\nlow-density baryon crystal are performed. These results are used to cross-check\na general numerical approach applicable for arbitrary quark masses and baryon\ndensities recently proposed by Bringoltz, which is based on a lattice in a\nfinite box with periodic boundary conditions. The Bringoltz method differs from\na previous approach of Salcedo, et al. in its treatment of a finite box effect\n- namely gauge configurations that wind around the box. One might expect these\neffects to be small for large enough boxes, in which the baryon density\napproaches zero to high accuracy at the edges. However, the effects of these\nwindings appear to be quite large even in such boxes. The large mass infinite\nvolume calculations performed here are consistent with the results of numerical\ncalculations using the Bringoltz method. The calculation of the baryon crystal\ninteraction energy requires the assumption that at low-densities the ground\nstate is composed of individual baryons, each in a color-singlet state and\northogonal to each other. This assumption is plausible but ad hoc in that one\ncan construct configurations in which the entire state is color-singlet but\ncannot be broken into individual color-singlet baryons. The interaction energy\nof low-density baryon crystals calculated with the assumption is consistent\nwith numerical results based on Bringoltz's approach suggesting that the\nassumption is justified. This further supports a similar assumption that was\nmade in 3+1 dimensions, where no alternative means of calculation exist.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures"]}]

In the former, the walking\nrule exclusively depends on the topology of the network and is responsible for\nthe exploratory behavior of the particles. In the latter, the walking rule\ndepends both on the topology and the domination levels that the particles\nimpose on the neighboring nodes. This type of behavior compels the particles to\nperform a defensive strategy, because it will force them to revisit nodes that\nare already dominated by them, rather than exploring rival territories.\nComputer simulations conducted on the networks extracted from the arXiv\nrepository of preprint papers and also from other databases reveal the\neffectiveness of the model, which turned out to be more accurate than\ntraditional clustering methods.\n"]}]

On the other side, the crossover field $H^{*}$, associated with\nthe energy scale $T^{*}(H)$ where a reconstruction of the Fermi surface has\nbeen observed, is not much influenced by the chemical substitution.}{Following\nthe analysis proposed in\nRefs.\\,\\cite{Paschen2004,Gegenwart2007,Friedemann2009,Tokiwa2009a} we have\nfitted the quantity $\\tilde{M}(H)=M+(dM/dH)H$ with a crossover function to\nindentify $H^{*}$. The $T^{*}(H)$ line follows an almost linear $H$-dependence\nat sufficiently high fields outside the AFM phase, but it deviates from\nlinearity at $T \\le T_{\\mathrm{N}}(0)$ and in\nYb(Rh$_{0.93}$Co$_{0.07}$)$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ it changes slope clearly inside the\nAFM phase. Moreover, the FWHM of the fit function depends linearly on\ntemperature outside the phase, but remains constant inside, suggesting either\nthat such an analysis is valid only for $T \\ge T_{\\mathrm{N}}(0)$ or that the\nFermi surface changes continuously at $T = 0$ inside the AFM phase.}}\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

These networks are required of evaluation\nmechanisms and distributed control and configurations, so each peer will be\nable to communicate with other peers. Resilience to faults, failures and\nattacks, are the main requirements of most communication systems and networks\ntoday. Thus, since P2P networks can be individually used as an infrastructure\nand an alternative for many other communication networks, they have to be more\nreliable, and resilient to the faults, failures and attacks compared to the\nclient and server approach. In this work, we present a detailed study on the\nbehavior of various P2P networks toward faults and failures, and focus on\nfault-tolerance subject. We consider two different static failure scenarios:\na)a random strategy in which nodes or edges of the network will be removed with\nan equal probability and without any knowledge of the networks infrastructure,\nb)a targeted strategy that uses some information about the nodes, and in which\nthe nodes with the highest degree have the most priority to be attacked. By\nstatic faults, we mean a situation where the nodes or components encounter some\nfaults before the network starts to work or through its operation, and will\nremain faulty to the end of the work session. Our goal is to introduce various\nmeasures to analyzing P2P networks evaluating their vulnerability rate. The\npresented criteria can be used for evaluating the reliability and vulnerability\nof P2P networks toward both random and targeted failures. There is no limit to\nthe number and types of failures, the presented measures are able to be used\nfor different types of failures and even a wide range of networks.\n"]}]

Instead\nof extending the canonical Solid-Face-Edge-Vertex schema by, say, \"hypersolids\"\nthese classes are generalised to a common type SpatialEntity, and the\nindividual BoundedBy relations between two consecutive classes are generalised\nto one BoundedBy relation on SpatialEntity instances. Then the pair\n(SpatialEntity, BoundedBy) is a so-called incidence graph.\n  The novelty about this approach uses the observation that an incidence graph\nrepresents a topological space of SpatialEntity instances because the\nBoundedBy-relation defines a so-called Alexandrov topology for them turning\nthem into a topological space. So spatial data becomes part of mathematical\ntopology and topology can be immediately applied to spatial data. For example,\ncontinuous functions between two instances of spatial data allow the consistent\nmodelling of generalisation. Further, it is also possible to establish a formal\ntopological definition of spatial data dimension, and every topological data\nmodel of arbitrary dimension gets a simple uniform data model. This model\ncovers space-time, and the version history of a spatial model can be\nrepresented by an Alexandrov topology, too. By integrating space, time,\nversion, and scale into one single schema, topological queries across those\naspects are enabled through topological constructions. In fact, the topological\nconstructions cover a relationally complete query language for spaces and can\nbe redefined to operate accordingly on their graph representations.\n  With these observations a relational database schema for a spatial data model\nof dimension 6 and more is developed. The schema seamlessly integrates 4D\nspace-time, levels of detail and version history, and it can be easily expanded\nto also contain non-spatial information or be linked to other data sources.\n","Comment: International Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Databases SSTD 2013"]}]

The replicator dynamic has been successfully used to extract dense\nclusters of graphs; however, it is often sensitive to the degree distribution\nof a graph, and usually biased by vertices with large degrees, thus may fail to\ndetect the densest cluster. To overcome this problem, we introduce a dynamic\nparameter, called path parameter, into the evolution process.
