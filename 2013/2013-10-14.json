In addition to\nthese two main goals, SPIRou will be able to tackle many key programs, from\nweather patterns on brown dwarf to solar-system planet atmospheres, to dynamo\nprocesses in fully-convective bodies and planet habitability. The science\nprograms that SPIRou proposes to tackle are forefront (identified as first\npriorities by most research agencies worldwide), ambitious (competitive and\ncomplementary with science programs carried out on much larger facilities, such\nas ALMA and JWST) and timely (ideally phased with complementary space missions\nlike TESS and CHEOPS).\n  SPIRou is designed to carry out its science mission with maximum efficiency\nand optimum precision. More specifically, SPIRou will be able to cover a very\nwide single-shot nIR spectral domain (0.98-2.35 \\mu m) at a resolving power of\n73.5K, providing unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a\n~15% average throughput and a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m/s.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, conference proceedings of the French Society of\n  Astronomy and Astrophysics meeting 2013"]}]

This model\nincorporates a shape prior of the white matter anatomy and the likelihood of\nindividual observed HARDI datasets. We first assume that the atlas is generated\nfrom a known hyperatlas through a flow of diffeomorphisms and its shape prior\ncan be constructed based on the framework of large deformation diffeomorphic\nmetric mapping (LDDMM). LDDMM characterizes a nonlinear diffeomorphic shape\nspace in a linear space of initial momentum uniquely determining diffeomorphic\ngeodesic flows from the hyperatlas. Therefore, the shape prior of the HARDI\natlas can be modeled using a centered Gaussian random field (GRF) model of the\ninitial momentum. In order to construct the likelihood of observed HARDI\ndatasets, it is necessary to study the diffeomorphic transformation of\nindividual observations relative to the atlas and the probabilistic\ndistribution of orientation distribution functions (ODFs). To this end, we\nconstruct the likelihood related to the transformation using the same\nconstruction as discussed for the shape prior of the atlas. The probabilistic\ndistribution of ODFs is then constructed based on the ODF Riemannian manifold.\nWe assume that the observed ODFs are generated by an exponential map of random\ntangent vectors at the deformed atlas ODF. Hence, the likelihood of the ODFs\ncan be modeled using a GRF of their tangent vectors in the ODF Riemannian\nmanifold. We solve for the maximum a posteriori using the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm and derive the corresponding update\nequations. Finally, we illustrate the HARDI atlas constructed based on a\nChinese aging cohort of 94 adults and compare it with that generated by\naveraging the coefficients of spherical harmonics of the ODF across subjects.\n"]}]
