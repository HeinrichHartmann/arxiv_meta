It is\napplicable to any logical system for which the consistency of a finite set of\npropositions can be established. The probabilistic inference scheme reduces to\nthe ordinary logical inference when the probabilities of all propositions are\neither 0 or 1. This logic has the same limitations of other probabilistic\nreasoning systems of the Bayesian approach. For common sense reasoning,\nconsistency is not a very natural assumption. We have some well known examples:\n{Dick is a Quaker, Quakers are pacifists, Republicans are not pacifists, Dick\nis a Republican}and {Tweety is a bird, birds can fly, Tweety is a penguin}. In\nthis paper, we shall propose some extensions of the probabilistic logic. In the\nsecond section, we shall consider the space of all interpretations, consistent\nor not. In terms of frames of discernment, the basic probability assignment\n(bpa) and belief function can be defined. Dempster's combination rule is\napplicable. This extension of probabilistic logic is called the evidential\nlogic in [ 1]. For each proposition s, its belief function is represented by an\ninterval [Spt(s), Pls(s)]. When all such intervals collapse to single points,\nthe evidential logic reduces to probabilistic logic (in the generalized version\nof not necessarily consistent interpretations). Certainly, we get Nilsson's\nprobabilistic logic by further restricting to consistent interpretations. In\nthe third section, we shall give a probabilistic interpretation of\nprobabilistic logic in terms of multi-dimensional random variables. This\ninterpretation brings the probabilistic logic into the framework of probability\ntheory. Let us consider a finite set S = {sl, s2, ..., Sn) of logical\npropositions. Each proposition may have true or false values; and may be\nconsidered as a random variable. We have a probability distribution for each\nproposition. The e-dimensional random variable (sl,..., Sn) may take values in\nthe space of all interpretations of 2n binary vectors. We may compute absolute\n(marginal), conditional and joint probability distributions. It turns out that\nthe permissible probabilistic interpretation vector of Nilsson [12] consists of\nthe joint probabilities of S. Inconsistent interpretations will not appear, by\nsetting their joint probabilities to be zeros. By summing appropriate joint\nprobabilities, we get probabilities of individual propositions or subsets of\npropositions. Since the Bayes formula and other techniques are valid for\ne-dimensional random variables, the probabilistic logic is actually very close\nto the Bayesian inference schemes. In the last section, we shall consider a\nrelaxation scheme for probabilistic logic. In this system, not only new\nevidences will update the belief measures of a collection of propositions, but\nalso constraint satisfaction among these propositions in the relational network\nwill revise these measures. This mechanism is similar to human reasoning which\nis an evaluative process converging to the most satisfactory result. The main\nidea arises from the consistent labeling problem in computer vision. This\nmethod is originally applied to scene analysis of line drawings. Later, it is\napplied to matching, constraint satisfaction and multi sensor fusion by several\nauthors [8], [16] (and see references cited there). Recently, this method is\nused in knowledge aggregation by Landy and Hummel [9].\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Second Conference on Uncertainty in\n  Artificial Intelligence (UAI1986)"]}]

These\ntheories primarily address the needs of expert systems, using knowledge\nstructures which must be pre-compiled and remain static in structure during\nruntime. Many Al systems require the ability to dynamically add and remove\nparts of the current knowledge structure (e.g., in order to examine what the\nworld would be like for different causal theories). This requires more\nflexibility than existing uncertainty systems display. In addition, many Al\nresearchers are only interested in using \"probabilities\" as a means of\nobtaining an ordering, rather than attempting to derive an accurate\nprobabilistic account of a situation. This indicates the need for systems which\nstress ease of use and don't require extensive probability information when one\ncannot (or doesn't wish to) provide such information. This paper attempts to\nhelp reconcile the gap between approaches to uncertainty and the needs of many\nAI systems by examining the control issues which arise, independent of a\nparticular uncertainty calculus. when one tries to satisfy these needs. Truth\nMaintenance Systems have been used extensively in problem solving tasks to help\norganize a set of facts and detect inconsistencies in the believed state of the\nworld.

It describes a belief Maintenance\nSystem that manages a current set of beliefs in much the same way that a TMS\nmanages a set of true/false propositions. If the system knows that belief in\nfact is dependent in some way upon belief in fact2, then it automatically\nmodifies its belief in facts when new information causes a change in belief of\nfact2. It models the behavior of a TMS, replacing its 3-valued logic (true,\nfalse, unknown) with an infinite valued logic, in such a way as to reduce to a\nstandard TMS if all statements are given in absolute true/false terms. Belief\nMaintenance Systems can, therefore, be thought of as a generalization of Truth\nMaintenance Systems, whose possible reasoning tasks are a superset of those for\na TMS.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Second Conference on Uncertainty in\n  Artificial Intelligence (UAI1986)"]}]

This scheme generalizes\nthe computational scheme proposed by Shafer and Logan1 for diagnostic trees of\nthe type studied by Gordon and Shortliffe, and the slightly more general scheme\ngiven by Shafer for hierarchical evidence. It also generalizes the scheme\nproposed by Pearl for Bayesian causal trees (see Shenoy and Shafer). Pearl's\ncausal trees and Gordon and Shortliffe's diagnostic trees are both ways of\nbreaking the evidence that bears on a large problem down into smaller items of\nevidence that bear on smaller parts of the problem so that these smaller\nproblems can be dealt with one at a time. This localization of effort is often\nessential in order to make the process of probability judgment feasible, both\nfor the person who is making probability judgments and for the machine that is\ncombining them. The basic structure for our scheme is a type of tree that\ngeneralizes both Pearl's and Gordon and Shortliffe's trees. Trees of this\ngeneral type permit localized computation in Pearl's sense. They are based on\nqualitative judgments of conditional independence. We believe that the scheme\nwe describe here will prove useful in expert systems. It is now clear that the\nsuccessful propagation of probabilities or certainty factors in expert systems\nrequires much more structure than can be provided in a pure production-system\nframework. Bayesian schemes, on the other hand, often make unrealistic demands\nfor structure. The propagation of belief functions in trees and more general\nnetworks stands on a middle ground where some sensible and useful things can be\ndone. We would like to emphasize that the basic idea of local computation for\npropagating probabilities is due to Judea Pearl. It is a very innovative idea;\nwe do not believe that it can be found in the Bayesian literature prior to\nPearl's work. We see our contribution as extending the usefulness of Pearl's\nidea by generalizing it from Bayesian probabilities to belief functions. In the\nnext section, we give a brief introduction to belief functions. The notions of\nqualitative independence for partitions and a qualitative Markov tree are\nintroduced in Section III.

Relative debugging is a collection of\ntechniques by which these differences are analysed. Differences may arise\nbecause of different interpretations of errors in the code, because of bugs in\nthe compilers or because of numerical drift, and all of these were observed in\nthe present study. Numerical drift arises when small and acceptable differences\nin values computed by different systems are integrated, so that the results\ndrift apart. This is well understood and need not degrade the validity of the\nprogram results. Coding errors and compiler bugs may degrade the results and\nshould be removed. This paper describes a technique for the comparison of two\nprogram runs which removes numerical drift and therefore exposes coding and\ncompiler errors. The procedure is highly automated and requires very little\nintervention by the user. The technique is applied to the Weather Research and\nForecasting model, the most widely used weather and climate modelling code.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]
