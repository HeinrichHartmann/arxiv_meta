We show that this\nincludes \"new\" UVQD (widely unfamiliar to modern audiences). We also show that\ntadpole renormalization is an automatic consequence of Ward-Takahashi\nidentities.\n  We prove that all UVQD therefore vanish identically in the Goldstone-mode\nlimit, where pions are Nambu-Goldstone Bosons (NGB), and where Lee and\nSymanzik's Goldstone Symmetry Restoration Condition (a renormalization\nprescription) enforces spontaneous symmetry breaking and the massless-ness of\nNGB. Axial-vector current conservation is restored as is SU(2)(L-R) chiral\nsymmetry: the vanishing of UVQD is therefore achieved in the Goldstone-mode by\nrestoration of an exact symmetry, and therefore (by definition) without\nfine-tuning!\n  A weak-scale Higgs mass is therefore not UVQD fine-tuned in the spontaneously\nbroken GML LSM. That is simply another (albeit unfamiliar) consequence of the\nGoldstone Theorem. Hence Goldstone-mode O(4) LSM symmetries are sufficient to\nensure that the theory does not suffer from the Higgs Fine Tuning Problem. This\nis contrary to the widely accepted belief that UVQD in the Higgs mass lead to\nsuch problems in the O(4) LSM, which are then presumed to be inherited by the\nStandard Model (SM). The key observation is to regard the spontaneously broken\nO(4) LSM as the Goldstone-mode limit of the GML LSM.\n  We prove this first at 1-loop then at all loop orders for the pure scalar GML\nmodel.

The first answer to this question, entirely based\non Physics, was given by Ehrenfest, in 1917, who showed that the stability\nrequirement for $n$-dimensional two-body planetary system very strongly\nconstrains space dimensionality, favoring 3-d. This kind of approach will be\ngenerically called \"stability postulate\" throughout this paper and was shown by\nTangherlini, in 1963, to be still valid in the framework of general relativity\nas well as for quantum mechanical hydrogen atom, giving the same constraint for\nspace-dimensionality. In the present work, before criticizing this methodology,\na brief discussion has been introduced, aimed at stressing and clarifying some\ngeneral physical aspects of the problem of how to determine the number of space\ndimensions. Then, the epistemological consequences of Ehrenfest's methodology\nare critically reviewed. An alternative procedure to get at the proper number\nof dimensions, in which the stability postulate (and the implicit singularities\nin three-dimensional physics) are not an essential part of the argument, is\nproposed. In this way, the main epistemological problems contained in\nEhrenfest's original idea are avoided. The alternative methodology proposed in\nthis paper is realized by obtaining and discussing the $n$-dimensional quantum\ntheory as expressed in Planck's law, de Broglie relation and the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relation. As a consequence, it is possible to propose an\nexperiment, based on thermal neutron diffraction by crystals, to directly\nmeasure space dimensionality.

Besides the\nwell-defined Kondo insulator and normal antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave\n(N-SDW) state, it is found that a nontrivial topological antiferromagnetic SDW\nstate (T-SDW) with a quantized Hall conductance is possible if the\nquasiparticle gap is dominated by the next-nearest-neighbor hopping rather than\nthe antiferromagnetic order. By analyzing the low-energy effective Chern-Simon\naction and the corresponding chiral edge state, the T-SDW could be considered\nas a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with antiferromagnetic long-range order.\nThis state is apparently beyond Landau-Ginzburg paradigm, which can be\nattributed to the interplay of quantum anomalous Hall effect and the subtle\nantiferromagnetic order in the Kondo-lattice-like model. While the transition\nbetween the SDW states and the Kondo insulator is found to be conventional (a\nfirst order transition), the transition between the N- and T-SDWs is, however,\na topological quantum phase transition. Interestingly, such topological quantum\nphase transition can be described by Dirac fermions coupled to a U\n(1)Chern-Simon gauge field, which resembles the critical theory between bosonic\ninteger quantum Hall phases and superfluid phase and also indicates that such a\ntopological quantum phase transition may fall into the 3D-XY universal class.\nIt is expected that the present work may shed light on the interplay between\nconduction electrons and the densely localized spins on the honeycomb lattice.\n","Comment: 11pages,3figures.

A widely used strategy in this context\nis to compare samples from several populations, and to look for genomic regions\nwith outstanding genetic differentiation between these populations. Genetic\ndifferentiation is generally based on allele frequency differences between\npopulations, which are measured by Fst or related statistics. Here we introduce\na new statistic, denoted hapFLK, which focuses instead on the differences of\nhaplotype frequencies between populations. In contrast to most existing\nstatistics, hapFLK accounts for the hierarchical structure of the sampled\npopulations. Using computer simulations, we show that each of these two\nfeatures - the use of haplotype information and of the hierarchical structure\nof populations - significantly improves the detection power of selected loci,\nand that combining them in the hapFLK statistic provides even greater power. We\nalso show that hapFLK is robust with respect to bottlenecks and migration and\nimproves over existing approaches in many situations. Finally, we apply hapFLK\nto a set of six sheep breeds from Northern Europe, and identify seven regions\nunder selection, which include already reported regions but also several new\nones. We propose a method to help identifying the population(s) under selection\nin a detected region, which reveals that in many of these regions selection\nmost likely occurred in more than one population.

The\nresult generalizes Conn's theorem from fixed points to arbitrary symplectic\nleaves.

Theorem 4 has a surprising application to the study\nof smooth deformation of Poisson structures: in Theorem 5 we compute the\nPoisson-moduli space around the Lie-Poisson sphere (i.e. the invariant unit\nsphere inside the linear Poisson manifold corresponding to a compact semisimple\nLie algebra). This is the first such computation of a Poisson moduli space in\ndimension greater or equal to 3 around a degenerate (i.e. non-symplectic)\nPoisson structure.

In addition of this,\nthere are also some theories of modification of gravity, by changing the law of\ngravity, it could be possible that the dark matter observations are explained.\nUntil the dark matter particle is detected, there is some room for uncertainty.\nSo we should consider every part of the problem and solve it. Dark matter\nproblem is covering a large area so every possibility is important. So f(R)\ngravity is also reviewed in this thesis and some theories are considered as a\npossible solution of dark matter problem. Finally we highlight that, even in\nthe case of WIMPs or another particles solution, f(R) gravity is also can be\nused for this problem.

This leads to\nthe notion of smoothly local properties.\n  In realising the definition of a local property at a particular point it may\nbe that there are choices that need to be made. To say that the local property\nis smoothly local is to say that those choices can be made smoothly dependent\non the point. In particular, that a manifold has charts is a local property. A\nlocal addition is the structure needed to say that there is a way to choose a\nchart about each point so that it varies smoothly with that point.\n  To be able to extend these ideas beyond that of the local additivity of\nmanifolds we work in a category of generalised smooth spaces. We are thus are\nable to consider more general mapping spaces than just those arising from the\nmaps from one smooth manifold to another and thus able to generalise the\nstandard result on when this space of maps is again a smooth manifold.\n  As applications of this generalisation we show that the mapping spaces\ninvolving the various figure 8s from String Topology are manifolds, and that\nthey embed as submanifolds with tubular neighbourhoods in the corresponding\nloop spaces.

The participation of the weak\ninteraction in the dynamics implies the resonances are not parity eigenstates\nand so should have pseudoscalar and scalar electroweak couplings. Also, a\ntree-unitarity condition could hold - in part because of the closeness of the\nelectroweak physical amplitudes to perturbation theory, and - in part because\nof the intimate relation with regge behavior. This would imply that the\ncombined physical couplings of the two resonances are comparable to those of\nthe Standard Model Higgs boson.
