Here, we demonstrate that such an ordered state can also\nbe obtained in an optically excited semiconductor quantum well in a high\nmagnetic field. When we create a dense electron-hole plasma with an intense\nlaser pulse, after a certain delay, an ultrashort burst of coherent radiation\nemerges. We interpret this striking phenomenon as a manifestation of\nsuperfluorescence (SF), in which a macroscopic polarization spontaneously\nbuilds up from an initially incoherent ensemble of excited quantum oscillators\nand then decays abruptly producing giant pulses of coherent radiation. SF has\nbeen observed in atomic gases, but the present work represents the first\nobservation of SF in a solid-state setting. While there is an analogy between\nthe recombination of electron-hole pairs and radiative transitions in atoms,\nthere is no a priori reason for SF in semiconductors to be similar to atomic\nSF. This is a complex many-body system with a variety of ultrafast\ninteractions, where the decoherence rates are at least 1,000 times faster than\nthe radiative decay rate, an unusual situation totally unexplored in previous\natomic SF studies. We show, nonetheless, that collective many-body coupling via\na common radiation field does develop under certain conditions and leads to SF\nbursts. The solid-state realization of SF resulted in an unprecedented degree\nof controllability in the generation of SF, opening up opportunities for both\nfundamental many-body studies and device applications. We demonstrate that the\nintensity and delay time of SF bursts are fully tunable through an external\nmagnetic field, temperature, and pump laser power.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Due to the heterogeneous nature of the area it is frequently\ndifficult to verify the scope of each result. In this paper we take closer look\nat recent developments, and provide additional results. Our analysis allows us\ncreate a taxonomy of the chase variations and the properties they satisfy.\n  Two of the most central problems regarding the chase is termination, and\ndiscovery of restricted classes of sets of dependencies that guarantee\ntermination of the chase. The search for the restricted classes has been\nmotivated by a fairly recent result that shows that it is undecidable to\ndetermine whether the chase with a given dependency set will terminate on a\ngiven instance. There is a small dissonance here, since the quest has been for\nclasses of sets of dependencies guaranteeing termination of the chase on all\ninstances, even though the latter problem was not known to be undecidable. We\nresolve the dissonance in this paper by showing that determining whether the\nchase with a given set of dependencies terminates on all instances is\ncoRE-complete. Our reduction also gives us the aforementioned\ninstance-dependent RE-completeness result as a byproduct.

On the other hand, in the ultrasoft energy region (p g^2T), the\nHTL approximation is inapplicable due to infrared singularity, so the question\nwhether there are any excitation modes in that energy region has not been\nstudied well. In this thesis, we analyze the quark spectrum whose energy is\nultrasoft in QGP, using the resummed perturbation theory which enables us to\nsuccessfully regularize the infrared singularity.

As a result, we establish the existence of a novel fermionic mode in\nthe ultrasoft energy region, and obtain the expressions of the pole position\nand the strength of that mode.

Is the Higgs Boson a\n  Twin ?"],"description":["  The extension of the standard model to $SU(3)_L\\times SU(3)_R \\times SU(3)_C$\nis considered. Spontaneous symmetry breaking requires two $(3^*, 3, 1)$ Higgs\nfield multiplets with a strong hierarchical structure of their vacuum\nexpectation values. An invariant potential is constructed to provide for these\nvacuum expectation values. This potential gives masses to all scalar fields\napart from the 15 Goldstone bosons. In case there exists a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the vacuum expectation values of the two field\nmultiplets, the scalar boson spectrum contains degenerate eigenstates. The\nlowest eigenstate has a mass near 123 GeV close to the Higgs-like particle\ndiscovered at the LHC. In one class of solutions this lowest state is a nearly\ndegenerate twin state. Each member is a superposition of fields from both\nmultiplets with about equal strength. The twins are non identical twins, namely\ndifferent combinations of a conventional Higgs and a Higgs field which is not\ncoupled to fermions, only to gauge bosons. A second class of solutions leads\nagain to degenerate states but in this case the state near 123 GeV remains a\nsingle state even for identical low scale vacuum expectation values in both\nmultiplets.\n","Comment: 6 pages"]}]
