An ongoing problem in cosmology concerns the fate of this\nenergy. In one interpretation it is irretrievably lost, i.e., energy is not\nconserved on the cosmic scale. Here we consider a different possibility which\nretains universal energy conservation. If gravitational energy is redshifted in\nthe same manner as photons, then it can be shown that the cosmic redshift\nremoves gravitational energy from space at about the same rate as photon\nenergy. Treating gravitational potential energy conventionally as negative\nenergy, it is proposed that the Hubble shift 'flips' positive energy (photons)\nto negative energy (gravitons) and vice versa. The lost photon energy would\nthus be directed towards gravitation, making gravitational energy wells more\nnegative. Conversely, within astrophysical bodies of sufficient size, the\nflipping of gravitons to photons would give rise to a 'Hubble luminosity' of\nmagnitude -UH, where U is the internal gravitational potential energy of the\nobject and H the Hubble constant. Evidence of such an energy release is\npresented in bodies ranging from planets, white dwarfs and neutron stars to\nsupermassive black holes and the visible universe.\n","Comment: 18 pages, including 2 tables, one figure"]}]
