SparseAssembler1 can\nsave as much as 90% memory consumption in comparison with the state-of-art\nassemblers, but it requires rounds of denoising to accurately assemble genomes.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new general model for genome assembly that uses\nonly sparse k-mers. The new model replaces the idea of the de Bruijn graph from\nthe beginning, and achieves similar memory efficiency and much better\nrobustness compared with our previous SparseAssembler1. Results: We demonstrate\nthat the decomposition of reads of all overlapping k-mers, which is used in\nexisting de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, is overly cautious. We introduce a\nsparse k-mer graph structure for saving sparse k-mers, which greatly reduces\nmemory space requirements necessary for de novo genome assembly. In contrast\nwith the de Bruijn graph approach, we devise a simple but powerful strategy,\ni.e., finding links between the k-mers in the genome and traversing following\nthe links, which can be done by saving only a few k-mers. To implement the\nstrategy, we need to only select some k-mers that may not even be overlapping\nones, and build the links between these k-mers indicated by the reads. We can\ntraverse through this sparse k-mer graph to build the contigs, and ultimately\ncomplete the genome assembly. Since the new sparse k-mers graph shares almost\nall advantages of de Bruijn graph, we are able to adapt a Dijkstra-like\nbreadth-first search algorithm to circumvent sequencing errors and resolve\npolymorphisms.\n","Comment: Corresponding authors: Zhanshan (Sam) Ma, ma@vandals.uidaho.edu;\n  Mihai Pop, mpop@umiacs.umd.edu || Availability: Programs in both Windows and\n  Linux are available at: https://sites.google.com/site/sparseassembler/"]}]

In this respect, many works have\nconcentrated on the disambiguation of the cosmological signals from the\ndominant reionization foregrounds. However, even after perfect foregrounds\nremoval, our ignorance on the background reionization history can significantly\naffect the cosmological parameter estimation. In particular, the\ninterdependence between the hydrogen ionized fraction, the baryon density and\nthe optical depth to the redshift of observation induce nontrivial degeneracies\nbetween the cosmological parameters that have not been considered so far. Using\na simple, but consistent reionization model, we revisit their expected\nconstraints for a futuristic giant 21-cm omniscope by using for the first time\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on multiredshift full sky simulated\ndata. Our results agree well with the usual Fisher matrix analysis on the\nthree-dimensional flat sky power spectrum but only when the above-mentioned\ndegeneracies are kept under control. In the opposite situation, Fisher results\ncan be inaccurate. We show that these conditions can be fulfilled by combining\ncosmic microwave background measurements with multiple observation redshifts\nprobing the beginning of EoR. This allows a precise reconstruction of the total\noptical depth, reionization duration and maximal spin temperature. Finally, we\ndiscuss the robustness of these results in presence of unresolved ionizing\nsources. Although most of the standard cosmological parameters remain weakly\naffected, we find a significant degradation of the background reionization\nparameter estimation in presence of nuisance ionizing sources.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 18 figures, uses RevTex.

LTL is not expressive\nenough to formalize the correctness of reactive systems with respect to some\nquantitative aspects. This paper extends the qualitative LTL synthesis setting\nto a quantitative setting. The alphabet of actions is extended with a weight\nfunction ranging over the rational numbers. The value of an infinite word is\nthe mean-payoff of the weights of its letters. The synthesis problem then\namounts to automatically construct (if possible) a reactive system whose\nexecutions all satisfy a given LTL formula and have mean-payoff values greater\nthan or equal to some given threshold. The latter problem is called LTLMP\nsynthesis and the LTLMP realizability problem asks to check whether such a\nsystem exists. We first show that LTLMP realizability is not more difficult\nthan LTL realizability: it is 2ExpTime-Complete. This is done by reduction to\ntwo-player mean-payoff parity games. While infinite memory strategies are\nrequired to realize LTLMP specifications in general, we show that\nepsilon-optimality can be obtained with finite memory strategies, for any\nepsilon > 0. To obtain an efficient algorithm in practice, we define a\nSafraless procedure to decide whether there exists a finite-memory strategy\nthat realizes a given specification for some given threshold. This procedure is\nbased on a reduction to two-player energy safety games which are in turn\nreduced to safety games. Finally, we show that those safety games can be solved\nefficiently by exploiting the structure of their state spaces and by using\nantichains as a symbolic data-structure. All our results extend to\nmulti-dimensional weights. We have implemented an antichain-based procedure and\nwe report on some promising experimental results.\n"]}]

The remanence\nratio MR/MS for these samples increase to 0.49 and 0.51, respectively.

It is a double counterpart of\nthe notion of a regular nilpotent element. A pair (e_1,e_2) of commuting\nnilpotent elements is called a pn-pair, if the dimension of their simultaneous\ncentralizer is equal to the rank of {\\frak g} and some bi-homogeneity condition\nis satisfied. Ginzburg proved that many familiar results of the `ordinary'\ntheory have analogues for pn-pairs. The aim of this article is to develop the\ntheory of nilpotent pairs a bit further and to present some applications of it\nto dual pairs and sheets. It is shown that a large portion of Ginzburg's theory\ncan be extended to the pairs whose simultaneous centraliser is of dimension\nrk{\\frak g}+1. Such pairs are called almost pn-pairs. It is worth noting that\nthe very existence of almost pn-pairs is a purely \"double\" phenomenon, because\nthe dimension of \"ordinary\" orbits is always even. We prove that to any\nprincipal or almost nilpotent pair one naturally associates a dual pair.\nMoreover, this dual pair is reductive if and only if e_1 and e_2 can be\nincluded in commuting sl_2-triples. We also study sheets containing members of\npn-pairs. Some cases are described, where these sheets are smooth and admit a\nsection.\n","Comment: 27 pages, LaTeX 2.09"]}]
