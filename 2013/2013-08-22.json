We prove a package of facts that provide a possible\nanswer. Let us call a system typical, if the homeomorphic type of its set of\nsolutions does not change as we perturb its (non-zero) coefficients. The set of\nall atypical systems turns out to be a hypersurface in the space of all systems\nof k equations in n variables, whose monomials are contained in k given finite\nsets. This hypersurface B contains all systems that have a singular solution,\nthis stratum is conventionally called the discriminant, and the codimension of\nits components has not been fully understood yet (e.g. dual defect toric\nvarieties are not classified), so the purity of dimension of B looks somewhat\nsurprising. We deduce it from a similar tropical purity fact.\n  A generic system of equations in a component B_i of the hypersurface B\ndiffers from a typical system by the Euler characteristic of its set of\nsolutions. Regarding the difference of these Euler characteristics as the\nmultiplicity of B_i, we turn B into an effective divisor, whose equation we\ncall the Euler discriminant by the following reasons. Firstly, it vanishes\nexactly at those systems that have a singular solution (possibly at infinity).\nSecondly, despite its topological definition, there is a simple\nlinear-algebraic formula for it, and a positive formula for its Newton\npolytope. Thirdly, it interpolates many classical objects (sparse resultant,\nA-determinant, discriminant of deformation) and inherits many of their nice\nproperties. This allows to specialize our results to generic polynomial maps:\nthe bifurcation set of a dominant polynomial map, whose components are generic\nlinear combinations of finitely many monomials, is always a hypersurface, and a\ngeneric atypical fiber of such a map differs from a typical one by its Euler\ncharacteristic.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 3 figures, references added, introduction extended, proofs\n  simplified in Section 2"]}]

The simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/cooling\nof primordial gas and the conversion of the gas into metal-free stars. To\nquantify the radiative feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emit\nboth molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation\nwith a simulation in which stars emit only dissociating radiation, and with a\nsimulation in which stars remain dark. Photodissociation and -ionization exert\na strong negative feedback on the assembly of the simulated galaxy. Gas\ncondensation is strongly impeded, and star formation is strongly suppressed in\ncomparison with the simulation in which stars remain dark. The feedback on the\ngas implies a suppression of the central dark matter densities in the minihalo\nprogenitor by factors of up to a few, which is a significant deviation from the\nsingular isothermal density profile characterizing the dark matter distribution\nin the absence of radiative feedback. The evolution of gas densities, star\nformation rates, and the distribution of dark matter becomes insensitive to the\ninclusion of dissociating radiation in the late stages of the minihalo\nassembly, and it becomes insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiation\nonce the minihalo turns into an atomically cooling galaxy. The formation of an\nextended disk inside the dwarf galaxy is a robust outcome not affected by the\ninclusion of radiation.

Detailed analysis reveals that nontrivial topological\nproperties can arise utilizing not only spin but also orbital degrees of\nfreedom in the strong SOC limit, when the bands acquire non-zero Chern numbers\nupon undergoing the so-called orbital purification. As a prototype of a buckled\nhoneycomb lattice with strong SOC we choose the Bi(111) bilayer, analyzing its\ntopological properties in detail.

We assessed\nthe effects of the passivating thiol-radical ligands on the optimized\nstructure, the energy gap, and on the absorption spectrum. The simplest thiol,\nmethanethiol, and four other thiol type ligands, namely - cysteine (Cys),\nmercaptopropionic acid (MPA), and their reduced-chain analogues, were\ninvestigated. We have come to the following conclusions. (a) Thiol-radical\nligands possessed greater effects on the structure and electronic properties of\nthe CdSe QDs than thiol ligands alone. (b) The sulfur 3p orbitals were\nlocalized as the midgap states for the thiol-radical-ligated complex, which\naltered the absorption spectrum of bare Cd6Se6 by inducing a new lower energy\nabsorption peak at 2.37 eV. (c) The thiol-radical-ligated complex was also\nfound to be sensitive to the position and number of ligands. (d) Both the amine\ngroup on Cys and the carboxyl group on Cys and MPA showed a strong tendency to\nbond with the neighboring Cd atom, especially when the length of the ligand was\nreduced. This formation of Cd-N and Cd-O bonds resulted in smaller HOMO-LUMO\ngaps and a stronger binding between the ligands and the surface atoms of CdSe\nnanoclusters.\n"]}]
