Astrometric parameters are commonly derived by fitting them as\nparameters of a timing model to a series of pulse times of arrival (TOAs). TOAs\nmeasured to microsecond precision over several-year spans can yield position\nmeasurements with sub-milliarcsecond precision. However, timing-based\nastrometry can become biased if a pulsar displays any red spin noise, which can\nbe compared to the red noise signal produced by the stochastic gravitational\nwave background. We investigate how noise of different spectral types is\nabsorbed by timing models, leading to significant estimation errors in the\nastrometric parameters. We find that commonly used techniques for fitting\ntiming models in the presence of red noise (Cholesky whitening) prevent the\nabsorption of noise into the timing model remarkably well if the time baseline\nof observations exceeds several years, but are inadequate for dealing with\nshorter pulsar data sets. Independent of timing, pulsar-optimized very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI) is capable of providing position estimates\nprecise to the sub-milliarcsecond levels needed for high-precision timing. We\ncompute a necessary transformation between the International Celestial\nReference Frame and pulsar timing frames and quantitatively discuss how the\ntransformation will improve in coming years. We find that incorporating VLBI\nastrometry into the timing models of pulsars for which only a couple of years\nof timing data exist will lead to more realistic assessments of red spin noise\nand could enhance the amplitude of gravitational wave signatures in post-fit\ntiming residuals by factors of 20 or more.\n","Comment: Published in Astrophysical Journal 777:104, 2013 November 10"]}]

High-contrast direct imaging of circumstellar disks is\nlimited by quasi-static speckle noise and ADI is commonly used to suppress\nthose speckles. However, the application of ADI can result in self-subtraction\nof the disk signal due to the disk's finite spatial extent. This signal\nattenuation varies with radial separation and biases measurements of the disk's\nsurface brightness, thereby compromising inferences regarding the physical\nprocesses responsible for the dust distribution. To compensate for this\nattenuation, we forward-model the disk structure and compute the form of the\nself-subtraction function at each separation. As a proof of concept, we apply\nour method to 1.6 and 2.2 micron Keck AO NIRC2 scattered-light observations of\nthe HD 32297 debris disk reduced using a variant of the \"locally optimized\ncombination of images\" (LOCI) algorithm. We are able to recover disk surface\nbrightness that was otherwise lost to self-subtraction and produce simplified\nmodels of the brightness distribution as it appears with and without\nself-subtraction. From the latter models, we extract radial profiles for the\ndisk's brightness, width, midplane position, and color that are unbiased by\nself-subtraction. Our analysis of these measurements indicates a break in the\nbrightness profile power law at r~110 AU and a disk width that increases with\nseparation from the star. We also verify disk curvature that displaces the\nmidplane by up to 30 AU towards the northwest relative to a straight fiducial\nmidplane.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 20 pages, 10 figures, 1 table"]}]

While the ultrafine grained structure of less\npure Ni remained stable during diffusion annealing, recrystallization and\nsubsequent grain growth occurred in high purity Ni at the same annealing\nconditions. Nevertheless, qualitatively similar ultrafast diffusion rates were\nmeasured in the samples of both purity levels. In high purity Ni, the kinetics\nof recrystallization was found to deviate strongly from the predictions of the\nJohnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov theory. Moreover, the ultrafast diffusion paths\nwithstood the recrystallization process. A model which accounts for solute\nredistribution in front of the moving boundary is suggested. Retaining of\ndeformation-induced ultrafast diffusion paths in recrystallized Ni is explained\nby a specific mechanism of enhanced stability of the residual ultrafine grained\nfraction against recrystallization.\n"]}]

Motivated by two important\nissues for the inference of this model, namely, the quantile inference for\n$H_0: \\beta=1$, and the goodness-of-fit for the unit root model, the notion of\nthe marked empirical process\n$\\alpha_n(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ng(X_i/a_n)I(\\varepsilon_i\\leq\nx),x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is investigated in this paper. Herein, $g(\\cdot)$ is a\ncontinuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\{a_n\\}$ is a sequence of\nself-normalizing constants. As the innovation $\\{\\varepsilon_i\\}$ is usually\nnot observable, the residual marked empirical process $\\hat\n{\\alpha}_n(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^ng(X_i/a_n)I(\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i\\l eq\nx),x\\in\\mathbb{R},$ is considered instead, where\n$\\hat{\\varepsilon}_i=X_i-\\hat{\\beta}X_{i-1}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ is a consistent\nestimate of $\\beta.$ In particular, via the martingale decomposition of\nstationary process and the stochastic integral result of Jakubowski (Ann.\nProbab. 24 (1996) 2141-2153), the limit distributions of $\\alpha_n(x)$ and\n$\\hat{\\alpha}_n(x)$ are established when $\\{\\varepsilon_i\\}$ is a short-memory\nprocess. Furthermore, by virtue of the results of Wu (Bernoulli 95 (2003)\n809-831) and Ho and Hsing (Ann. Statist. 24 (1996) 992-1024) of empirical\nprocess and the integral result of Mikosch and Norvai\\v{s}a (Bernoulli 6 (2000)\n401-434) and Young (Acta Math. 67 (1936) 251-282), the limit distributions of\n$\\alpha_n(x)$ and $\\hat{\\alpha}_n(x)$ are also derived when $\\{\\varepsilon_i\\}$\nis a long-memory process.\n","Comment: Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.3150/12-BEJ444 the Bernoulli\n  (http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/) by the International Statistical\n  Institute/Bernoulli Society (http://isi.cbs.nl/BS/bshome.htm)"]}]

Both approaches use the grouping\nefficacy measure as the objective function. Up to the authors' knowledge, these\nare the first exact methods that employ such a measure to optimally solve\ninstances of the MCFP. The first approach consists of iteratively running\nseveral calls to a parameterized version of the BGEP, and the second is a\nlinearization of a new fractional-linear model for the MCFP. Computational\nexperiments performed on instances of the MCFP found in the literature show\nthat our exact methods for the MCFP are able to prove several previously\nunknown optima.\n","Comment: 19 pages"]}]

Beyond its wide\napplicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the\ndifficulty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In\nthis work, we develop from first principles the generalized likelihood ratio\ntest for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the\nvertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally\ninfeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lovasz extended scan statistic\n(LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the intractable generalized\nlikelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum\na-posteriori inference in Markov random fields, which provides us with a\npoly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to\ncontrol type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk\nconsistent. Finally, we consider specific graph models, the torus, k-nearest\nneighbor graphs, and epsilon-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our\nresults provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower\nbounds.\n"]}]
