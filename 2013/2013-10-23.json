It follows from an all-order conjecture for the\nanomalous-dimension matrix of n-jet operators in soft-collinear effective\ntheory. We show that the form of this anomalous dimension is severely\nconstrained by soft-collinear factorization, non-abelian exponentiation, and\nthe behavior of amplitudes in collinear limits. Using a diagrammatic analysis,\nwe demonstrate that these constraints imply that to three-loop order the\nanomalous dimension involves only two-parton correlations, with the possible\nexception of a single color structure multiplying a function of conformal cross\nratios depending on the momenta of four external partons, which would have to\nvanish in all two-particle collinear limits. We argue that such a function does\nnot appear at three-loop order, and that the same is true in higher orders. Our\nformula predicts Casimir scaling of the cusp anomalous dimension to all orders\nin perturbation theory, and we explicitly check that the constraints exclude\nthe appearance of higher Casimir invariants at four loops. Using known results\nfor the quark and gluon form factors, we derive the three-loop coefficients of\nthe 1/epsilon^n pole terms (with n=1,...,6) for an arbitrary n-parton\nscattering amplitude in massless QCD.

This second-generation formalism\nincorporates \"recursive nonlinearities\": the process by which\nalready-established metric perturbations will then act to slow down all future\nflows of inhomogeneity information. Here, the long-range effects of causal\nbackreaction are now damped, weakening its impact for models that were\npreviously best-fit cosmologies. Nevertheless, we find that causal backreaction\ncan be recovered as a replacement for Dark Energy via the adoption of larger\nvalues for the dimensionless `strength' of the clustering evolution functions\nbeing modeled -- a change justified by the hierarchical nature of clustering\nand virialization in the universe, occurring on multiple cosmic length scales\nsimultaneously. With this, and with one new model parameter representing the\nslowdown of clustering due to astrophysical feedback processes, an alternative\ncosmic concordance can once again be achieved for a matter-only universe in\nwhich the apparent acceleration is generated entirely by causal backreaction\neffects. One drawback is a new degeneracy which broadens our predicted range\nfor the observed jerk parameter $j_{0}^{\\mathrm{Obs}}$, thus removing what had\nappeared to be a clear signature for distinguishing causal backreaction from\nCosmological Constant $\\Lambda$CDM. As for the long-term fate of the universe,\nincorporating recursive nonlinearities appears to make the possibility of an\n`eternal' acceleration due to causal backreaction far less likely; though this\ndoes not take into account gravitational nonlinearities or the large-scale\nbreakdown of cosmological isotropy, effects not easily modeled within this\nformalism.\n","Comment: 53 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables.

We show\nthat such systems have a long pre-contact phase, which lasts for 8-9 Gyrs,\nwhile the contact phase takes only about 0.8 Gyr, which is rather a short\nfraction of the total life. With low mass transfer rate during contact,\nmoderate mass ratios prevail in LMCBs since they do not have enough time to\nreach extreme mass ratios often observed in higher mass binaries. During the\nwhole evolution both components of LMCBs remain within the MS band.\n  The evolution of cool contact binaries towards merging is controlled by the\ninterplay between the evolutionary expansion of the less massive component\nresulting in the mass transfer to the more massive component and the angular\nmomentum loss from the system by the magnetized wind. In LMCB the angular\nmomentum loss prevails. As a result, the orbital period systematically\ndecreases until the binary overflows the outer critical Roche surface and the\ncomponents merge into a single fast rotating star of a solar type surrounded by\na remnant disk carrying excess angular momentum. The disk can be a place of\nplanet formation with the age substantially lower than the age of a host star.\nThe calculated theoretical tracks show good agreement with the physical\nproperties of LMCB from the available observations.
