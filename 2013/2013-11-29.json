However, the analysis of\nlarge networks is not trivial. In order to simplify the analysis of such\nnetworks, several model reduction algorithms have been proposed; however, it is\nnot clear if such algorithms scale well with respect to the number of nodes.\nThe goal of this paper is to propose and implement an algorithm for the\nreduction of AND-NOT network models for the purpose of steady state\ncomputation. Our method of network reduction is the use of \"steady state\napproximations\" that do not change the number of steady states. Our algorithm\nis designed to work at the wiring diagram level without the need to evaluate or\nsimplify Boolean functions. Also, our implementation of the algorithm takes\nadvantage of the sparsity typical of discrete models of biological systems. The\nmain features of our algorithm are that it works at the wiring diagram level,\nit runs in polynomial time, and it preserves the number of steady states. We\nused our results to study AND-NOT network models of gene networks and showed\nthat our algorithm greatly simplifies steady state analysis. Furthermore, our\nalgorithm can handle sparse AND-NOT networks with up to 1000000 nodes.\n"]}]
