This means that the expectation value of the scale factor $<a>(t)$\nnever vanishes and, as $t\\to\\infty$, we recover the classical expression for\nthe scale factor. In this paper, we show that such universes can be reproduced\nby classical cosmology given that the universe is filled with an exotic matter.\nIn the case of a perfect fluid, we find an implicit equation of state (EoS). We\nthen show that this single fluid with an implict EoS is equivalent to two\nnon-interacting fluids, one of them representing stiff matter with negative\nenergy density. In the case of two non-interacting scalar fields, one of them\nof the phantom type, we find their potential energy. In both cases we find that\nquantum mechanics changes completely the configuration of matter for small\nvalues of time, by adding a fluid or a scalar field with negative energy\ndensity. As time passes, the density of negative energy decreases and we\nrecover the ordinary content of the classical universe. The more the initial\nwave function of the universe is concentrated around the classical big bang\nsingularity, the more it is necessary to add negative energy, since this type\nof energy will be responsible for the removal of the classical singularity.\n","Comment: updated version as accepted by Gen.

The focused beam from the\ninterferometer probes the cantilever at different positions and the spatial\nshapes of the modes are determined up to the fifth resonance, without external\nexcitation. The results clearly demonstrate that the first eigenmode almost\ndoesn't change by mass loading. However the oscillation behavior of higher\nresonances present a marked difference: with a particle glued at its extremity,\nthe nodes of the mode are displaced towards the free end of the cantilever.\nThese results are compared to an analytical model taking into account the mass\nand the inertial moment of the load in an Euler-Bernoulli framework, where the\nnormalization of the eigenmodes is explicitly worked out in order to allow a\nquantitative prediction of the thermal noise amplitude of each mode. A good\nagreement between the experimental results and the analytical model is\ndemonstrated, allowing a clean calibration of the probe stiffness.\n"]}]

In chapter 1 we introduce the gauge/gravity conjecture focusing\non the aspects that will be relevant in the rest of the work, in chapter 2 we\nextend the Gubser-Klebanov-Polyakov-Witten (GKPW) prescription generalizing it\nto gravity backgrounds with two boundaries. In chapter 3 we discuss the\nMaldacena-Rey prescription to compute the quark-antiquark (and\nmonopole-antimonopole) potential in some gravity backgrounds duals to conformal\nand non-conformal field theories. In particular, we analyze the stability of\nthe classical solutions under small fluctuations. In chapter 4 we study the\nthermodynamic properties and the entanglement entropy of the 2+1 dimensional\n$p$ and $p+ip$ superconductors through their dual gravity backgrounds. We\nanalyze the limit where the number of charged degrees of freedom is comparable\nwith the total number of degrees of freedom, which means that the backreaction\non the geometry due to the non-Abelian gauge field is relevant.\n","Comment: Ph.D. Thesis, In Spanish"]}]

In particular, we show how to generalize and\nefficiently implement a method proposed by Nesterov, giving faster asymptotic\nrunning times for various algorithms that use standard coordinate descent as a\nblack box. In addition to providing a proof of convergence for this new general\nmethod, we show that it is numerically stable, efficiently implementable, and\nin certain regimes, asymptotically optimal.\n  To highlight the computational power of this algorithm, we show how it can\nused to create faster linear system solvers in several regimes:\n  - We show how this method achieves a faster asymptotic runtime than conjugate\ngradient for solving a broad class of symmetric positive definite systems of\nequations.\n  - We improve the best known asymptotic convergence guarantees for Kaczmarz\nmethods, a popular technique for image reconstruction and solving\noverdetermined systems of equations, by accelerating a randomized algorithm of\nStrohmer and Vershynin.\n  - We achieve the best known running time for solving Symmetric Diagonally\nDominant (SDD) system of equations in the unit-cost RAM model, obtaining an O(m\nlog^{3/2} n (log log n)^{1/2} log (log n / eps)) asymptotic running time by\naccelerating a recent solver by Kelner et al.\n  Beyond the independent interest of these solvers, we believe they highlight\nthe versatility of the approach of this paper and we hope that they will open\nthe door for further algorithmic improvements in the future.\n"]}]
