Instead, Von Neumann's hypothesis for the entropy [2] is most\nwidely used. However this gives zero for systems with a known wave function,\nthat is a pure state. This is because it measures the lack of information about\nthe system rather than the flow of heat as obtained from thermodynamic\nexperiments.

We argue that\nit is impossible to construct a lattice action that implements both the O(3)\nsymmetry as well as at least one supersymmetry exactly at finite lattice\nspacing. It is shown by explicit calculations that previously proposed\ndiscretizations fail to reproduce the exact symmetries of the target manifold\nin the continuum limit. We provide an alternative lattice action with exact\nO(3) symmetry and compare two approaches based on different derivative\noperators. Using the nonlocal SLAC derivative for the quenched model on\nmoderately sized lattices we extract the value {\\sigma}(2, u_0) = 1.2604(13)\nfor the step scaling function at u_0 = 1.0595, to be compared with the exact\nvalue 1.261210. For the supersymmetric model with SLAC derivative the discrete\nchiral symmetry is maintained but we encounter strong sign fluctuations,\nrendering large lattice simulations ineffective. By applying the Wilson\nprescription, supersymmetry and chiral symmetry are broken explicitly at finite\nlattice spacing, though there is clear evidence that both are restored in the\ncontinuum limit by fine tuning of a single mass parameter.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 36 figures, 2 tables; updated version as accepted by JHEP"]}]

One such qubit, the\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin in diamond, can be initialized and read out\nthrough its special spin selective intersystem crossing, while microwave\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) techniques provide unitary spin rotations.\nInstead, we demonstrate an alternative, fully optical approach to these control\nprotocols in an NV center that does not rely on its intersystem crossing.

Individual hyperfine lines can be\nstrongly boosted or suppressed.

During the 2011-12 academic year, we implemented a \"Physics\nof the life sciences\" curriculum centered on a draft textbook that takes a\nnovel approach to teaching physics to life science majors. In addition,\nsubstantial revisions were made to the homework and hands-on components of the\ncourse to emphasize the relationship between physics and the life sciences and\nto help the students to learn to apply physical intuition to life\nscience-oriented problems. Student learning and attitudinal outcomes were\nassessed both quantitatively, using standard physics education research\ninstruments, and qualitatively, using student surveys and a series of\npost-semester interviews. Students experienced high conceptual learning gains,\ncomparable to other active learning-based physics courses. Qualitatively, a\nsubstantial fraction of interviewed students reported an increased interest in\nphysics relative to the beginning of the semester. Furthermore, more than half\nof students self-reported that they could now relate physics topics to their\nmajors and future careers, with interviewed subjects demonstrating a high level\nof ability to come up with examples of how physics affects living organisms and\nhow it helped them to better understand content presented in courses in their\nmajor.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

Our method\nprovides security for the transmission sessions against computational\nbrute-force attacks and also weakly security in information theoretic sense. As\nthe broadcast channel is assumed to be erroneous, the missing coded packets\nshould be recovered in some way. We consider two different scenarios. In the\nfirst scenario the missing packets are retransmitted by the base station\n(centralized). In the second scenario the clients cooperate with each other by\nexchanging packets (decentralized). In both scenarios, network coding\ntechniques are exploited to increase the total throughput. For the case of\ncentralized retransmissions we provide an analytical approximation for the\nthroughput performance of instantly decodable network coded (IDNC)\nretransmissions as well as numerical experiments.
