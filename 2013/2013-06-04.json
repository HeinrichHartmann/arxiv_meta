The linear theory of a\nnoninteracting Fermi gas is reviewed and several consistency constraints are\nverified. The challenge to formulate linear response theories of BCS\nsuperfluids consistent with density and spin conservation laws comes from the\npresence of a broken U(1)$_{\\textrm{EM}}$ symmetry associated with\nelectromagnetism (EM) and we discuss two routes for circumventing this. The\nfirst route follows Nambu's integral-equation approach for the EM vertex\nfunction, but this method is not specific for BCS superfluids. We focus on the\nsecond route based on a consistent-fluctuation-of-the order-parameter (CFOP)\napproach where the gauge transformation and the fluctuations of the order\nparameter are treated on equal footing. The CFOP approach allows one to\nexplicitly verify several important constraints: The EM vertex satisfies not\nonly a Ward identity which guarantees charge conservation but also a $Q$-limit\nWard identity associated with the compressibility sum rule. In contrast, the\nspin degrees of freedom associated with another U(1)$_z$ symmetry are not\naffected by the Cooper-pair condensation that breaks only the\nU(1)$_{\\textrm{EM}}$ symmetry. As a consequence the collective modes from the\nfluctuations of the order parameter only couple to the density response\nfunction but decouple from the spin response function, which reflects the\ndifferent fates of the two U(1) symmetries in the superfluid phase. Our\nformulation lays the ground work for application to more general theories of\nBCS-Bose Einstein Condensation crossover both above and below $T_c$.\n","Comment: Review on gauge invariance and charge-spin difference of BCS theory.\n  27 pages, 1 figure.

When the electron and nuclear\nreservoirs are also assumed to be in strong thermal contact and the microwave\nirradiation saturates the target electron transition, the enhancement of the\nnuclear polarization is expected to be considerably high even if the\nirradiation frequency is set far away from the centre of the ESR line (as\nalready observed by Borghini) and the typical polarization time is reduced on\nmoving towards the boundaries of said line. More reasonable behaviours are\nobtained by reducing the level of microwave saturation or the contact between\nelectrons and nuclei in presence of nuclear leakage. In both cases the function\ndescribing the dependency of the steady state nuclear polarization on the\nfrequency of irradiation becomes sharper at the edges and the build up rate\ndecreases on moving off-resonance. If qualitatively similar in terms of the\neffects produced on nuclear polarization, the degree of microwave saturation\nand of electron-nucleus contact has a totally different impact on electron\npolarization, which is of course strongly correlated to the effectiveness of\nsaturation and almost insensitive, at the steady state, to the magnitude of the\ninteractions between the two spin reservoirs.

Because of the high risks it\nis important that government leaders manage the attendant risks. We analysed a\nsample of 1,355 public sector IT projects. The sample included large-scale\nprojects, on average the actual expenditure was $130 million and the average\nduration was 35 months. Our findings showed that the typical project had no\ncost overruns and took on average 24% longer than initially expected. However,\ncomparing the risk distribution with the normative model of a thin-tailed\ndistribution, projects' actual costs should fall within -30% and +25% of the\nbudget in nearly 99 out of 100 projects. The data showed, however, that a\nstaggering 18% of all projects are outliers with cost overruns >25%. Tests\nshowed that the risk of outliers is even higher for standard software (24%) as\nwell as in certain project types, e.g., data management (41%), office\nmanagement (23%), eGovernment (21%) and management information systems (20%).\nAnalysis showed also that projects duration adds risk: every additional year of\nproject duration increases the average cost risk by 4.2 percentage points.\nLastly, we suggest four solutions that public sector organization can take: (1)\nbenchmark your organization to know where you are, (2) de-bias your IT project\ndecision-making, (3) reduce the complexities of your IT projects, and (4)\ndevelop Masterbuilders to learn from the best in the field.\n","Comment: Published in Commonwealth Secretariat (Eds.): Commonwealth Governance\n  Handbook 2012/13: Democracy, development and public administration, London:\n  Commonwealth Secretariat, December 2012.

Yet to punish is costly, and the\ncosts often do not offset the gains that are due to elevated levels of\ncooperation. However, the effectiveness of punishment depends not only on how\ncostly it is, but also on the circumstances defining the social dilemma. Using\nthe snowdrift game as the basis, we have conducted a series of economic\nexperiments to determine whether severe punishment is more effective than mild\npunishment. We have observed that severe punishment is not necessarily more\neffective, even if the cost of punishment is identical in both cases. The\nbenefits of severe punishment become evident only under extremely adverse\nconditions, when to cooperate is highly improbable in the absence of sanctions.\nIf cooperation is likely, mild punishment is not less effective and leads to\nhigher average payoffs, and is thus the much preferred alternative. Presented\nresults suggest that the positive effects of punishment stem not only from\nimposed fines, but may also have a psychological background. Small fines can do\nwonders in motivating us to chose cooperation over defection, but without the\nparalyzing effect that may be brought about by large fines.

This vibration of this rather complex\nstructure is described here with models which need only a small number of\nparameters. Predictions of the models are compared with results of experiments\nthat have been presented in Ege et al. [Vibroacoustics of the piano soundboard:\n(Non)linearity and modal properties in the low- and mid- frequency ranges,\nJournal of Sound and Vibration 332 (5) (2013) 1288-1305]. The apparent modal\ndensity of the soundboard of an upright piano in playing condition, as seen\nfrom various points of the structure, exhibits two well-separated regimes,\nbelow and above a frequency flim that is determined by the wood characteristics\nand by the distance between ribs. Above flim, most modes appear to be\nlocalised, presumably due to the irregularity of the spacing and height of the\nribs. The low-frequency regime is predicted by a model which consists of\ncoupled sub-structures: the two ribbed areas split by the main bridge and, in\nmost cases, one or two so-called cut-off corners. In order to assess the\ndynamical properties of each of the subplates (considered here as homogeneous\nplates), we propose a derivation of the (low-frequency) modal density of an\northotropic homogeneous plate which accounts for the boundary conditions on an\narbitrary geometry. Above flim, the soundboard, as seen from a given excitation\npoint, is modelled as a set of three structural wave-guides, namely the three\ninter-rib spacings surrounding the excitation point. Based on these low- and\nhigh-frequency models, computations of the point-mobility and of the apparent\nmodal densities seen at several excitation points match published measurements.\nThe dispersion curve of the wave-guide model displays an acoustical radiation\nscheme which differs significantly from that of a thin homogeneous plate. It\nappears that piano dimensioning is such that the subsonic regime of acoustical\nradiation extends over a much wider frequency range than it would be for a\nhomogeneous plate with the same low-frequency vibration. One problem in piano\nmanufacturing is examined in relationship with the possible radiation schemes\ninduced by the models.\n","Comment: Research highlights: - Synthetic modelling of a piano soundboard\n  overa broad-frequency-range (several kHz). - Quantitative agreement between\n  predicted and measured apparent local modal density. -Modal density of a\n  plate with non-special orthotropy and arbitrary contour. -Similar\n  characteristic impedance between comparable pianos, over several kHz.\n  -Extension of the subsonic regime of acoustical radiation over a wide\n  frequency range.

Such a cost has a profound influence on\nthe global structure of these networks which usually display a hierarchical\nspatial organization. The link between local constraints and large-scale\nstructure is however not elucidated and we introduce here a generic model for\nthe growth of spatial networks based on the general concept of cost benefit\nanalysis. This model depends essentially on one single scale and produces a\nfamily of networks which range from the star-graph to the minimum spanning tree\nand which are characterised by a continuously varying exponent. We show that\nspatial hierarchy emerges naturally, with structures composed of various hubs\ncontrolling geographically separated service areas, and appears as a\nlarge-scale consequence of local cost-benefit considerations. Our model thus\nprovides the first building blocks for a better understanding of the evolution\nof spatial networks and their properties. We also find that, surprisingly, the\naverage detour is minimal in the intermediate regime, as a result of a large\ndiversity in link lengths.

When optimized, the nanopyramids lead to a\nhigher absorption in the crystalline silicon than the conventional micron-scale\nrandom pyramids in the visible and near the band edge, with a superior\nrobustness to variations of the angle of the incident light.

Further, about 77% of the participants said that they\nwould want to use a system which could provide them access control features, to\nmaintain their privacy while sharing emails. To address the privacy concerns of\nusers who need to share emails, we propose ChaMAILeon, a system which enables\nusers to share their email passwords while maintaining their privacy.\nChaMAILeon allows users to create multiple passwords for their email account.\nEach such password corresponds to a different set of access control rules, and\ngives a different view of the same email account. We conducted a controlled\nexperiment with 30 participants to evaluate the usability of the system. Each\nparticipant was required to perform 5 tasks. Each task corresponded to\ndifferent access control rules, which the participant was required to set, for\na dummy email account. We found that, with a reasonable number of multiple\nattempts, all 30 participants were able to perform all 5 tasks given to them.\nThe system usability score was found out to be 75.42. Moreover, 56.6% of the\nparticipants said that they would like to use ChaMAILeon frequently.\n","Comment: 12 pages without references and appendices"]}]

The matching of drivers and\npassengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies.\nTypically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on\nhis/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for trips\nand contact the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long\ntrips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is\nnot used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering\nthis service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption.\nDynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and\nincreasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling\nimpromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street\nand can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no\ndynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize\nsuch systems failed. This paper reviews the state of the art of dynamic\ncarpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of\ndynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It\nproposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic\ncarpooling systems.\n","Comment: 10 pages, whitepaper, extracted from B.Sc. thesis \"Dycapo: On the\n  creation of an open-source Server and a Protocol for Dynamic Carpooling\"\n  (Daniel Graziotin, 2010)"]}]

Classical solutions proposed to solve this problem are\nmainly adopting locking or blocking techniques. These techniques are not\nsuitable for cloud environments as they produce terrible response times; due to\nthe long latency and faultiness of wide area network connections among cloud\ndatacenters. One way to improve performance is to restrict access of\nusers-bases to specific datacenters and avoid data sharing between datacenters.\nHowever, conflicts might appear when data is replicated between datacenters;\nnevertheless change propagation timeliness is not guaranteed. Such problems\ncreated data uncertainty on cloud environments. Managing data uncertainty is\none of the main obstacles for supporting global distributed transactions on the\nclouds. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes an quota-based approach\nfor managing data uncertainty on the clouds that guarantees global data\ncorrectness without global locking or blocking. To decouple service developers\nfrom the hassles of managing data uncertainty, we propose to use a new platform\nservice (i.e. Data Consistency as a Service (DCaaS)) to encapsulate the\nproposed approach. DCaaS service also ensures SaaS services cloud portability,\nas it works as a cloud adapter between SaaS service instances.
