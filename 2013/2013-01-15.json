There is now good evidence that linked selection plays an\nimportant role in shaping polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of\nthe best investigated models of linked selection is the recurrent full sweep\nmodel, in which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of\nselected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined for rapid\nfixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent selective sweeps in a\ncoalescent framework, one that generalizes the recurrent full sweep model to\nthe case where selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a\nlarge population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects\nthe genealogy at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions\nare unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the\ntheory to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps\non levels of neutral diversity, and find that for a given reduction in\ndiversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at\nneutral sites is determined primarily by the frequencies achieved by the\nselected alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low\nfrequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the\nfrequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent\nmodel under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard\nneutral model.

In the opposite direction,\nwe next introduce a quantum generalization of the polynomial-time hierarchy,\nand define problems which we prove are not only complete for the second level\nof this hierarchy, but are in fact hard to approximate.\n  In the second area, we study variants of the interesting and stubbornly open\nquestion of whether a quantum proof system with multiple unentangled quantum\nprovers is equal in expressive power to a proof system with a single quantum\nprover. Our results concern classes such as BellQMA(poly), and include a novel\nproof of perfect parallel repetition for SepQMA(m) based on cone programming\nduality.\n  In the third area, we study non-classical quantum correlations beyond\nentanglement, often dubbed \"non-classicality\". Among our results are two novel\nschemes for quantifying non-classicality: The first proposes the new paradigm\nof exploiting local unitary operations to study non-classical correlations, and\nthe second introduces a protocol through which non-classical correlations in a\nstarting system can be \"activated\" into distillable entanglement with an\nancilla system.\n  An introduction to all required linear algebra and quantum mechanics is\nincluded.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis, 240 pages"]}]

The\ndependence of the electron energy spectrum and its radial probability density\non nano-system radius are studied. The numeric calculations and analysis of\noscillator strength of intersubband quantum transition from the ground state\ninto two first allowed excited states at the varying radius, for both the\nfinite and infinite confining potential (CP) as well as constant shell\nthickness, are performed. It is shown that, in particular, the binding energy\nand the oscillator strength of the hydrogenic impurity of a MLQAD behave\ndifferently from that of a single-layered quantum antidot (SLQAD).

We show that most\ncommunities in real networks have a small internal dominating set and a small\nexternal dominating set, and that the internal dominating set of a community\nkeeps much of the information of the community. Secondly, based on the notions\nof the internal dominating set and the external dominating set, we define an\ninternal slope (ISlope, for short) and an external slope (ESlope, for short) to\nmeasure the internal heterogeneity and external heterogeneity of a community\nrespectively. We show that the internal slope (ISlope) of a community largely\ndetermines the structure of the community, that most communities in real\nnetworks are heterogeneous, meaning that most of the communities have a\ncore/periphery structure, and that both ISlopes and ESlopes (reflecting the\nstructure of communities) of all the communities of a network approximately\nfollow a normal distribution. Therefore typical values of both ISolpes and\nESoples of all the communities of a given network are in a narrow interval, and\nthere is only a small number of communities having ISlopes or ESlopes out of\nthe range of typical values of the ISlopes and ESlopes of the network. Finally,\nwe show that all the communities of the real networks we studied, have a three\ndegree separation phenomenon, that is, the average distance of communities is\napproximately 3, implying a general property of true communities for many real\nnetworks, and that good community finding algorithms find communities that\namplify clustering coefficients of the networks, for many real networks.\n"]}]

In ITER-type fusion reactors, such\npopulations can be generated by fusion reactions or auxiliary heating. The\nelectron-driven fishbone mode results from the resonant interaction of the\ninternal kink mode with the slow toroidal precessional motion of energetic\nelectrons and is frequently observed in present-day tokamaks with Electron\nCyclotron Resonance Heating or Lower Hybrid Current Drive. In Tore Supra,\nelectron-driven fishbones are observed during LHCD-powered discharges in which\na high-energy tail of the electronic distribution function is created. Although\nthe destabilization of those modes is related to the existence of a fast\nparticle population, the modes are observed at a frequency that is lower than\nexpected. The linear stability analysis of electron-driven fishbone modes is\nthe main focus of this thesis. The fishbone dispersion relation is derived in a\nform that accounts for the contribution of the parallel motion of passing\nparticles to the resonance condition. The MIKE code is developed to compute and\nsolve the dispersion relation of electron-driven fishbones. The code is\nsuccessfully benchmarked against theory using simple analytical distributions.\nUsing the code MIKE with parametric distributions and equilibria, we show that\nboth barely trapped and barely passing electrons resonate with the mode and can\ndrive it unstable. More deeply trapped and passing electrons have a\nnon-resonant effect on the mode that is, respectively, stabilizing and\ndestabilizing.

The aims\nof this paper are, first, to present evidence that favours the classification\nof both sources as SNRs, and, second, to describe basic parameters (integrated\nflux density, spectrum, and polarization) as well as properties (morphology,\nline-of-sight velocity, distance and physical size) to facilitate and motivate\nfuture observations. Spectral and polarization parameters are derived from\nmultiwavelength data from existing radio surveys carried out at wavelengths\nbetween 6 and 92cm. In particular for the source G152.4-2.1 we also use new\nobservations at 11cm done with the Effelsberg 100m telescope. The interstellar\nmedium around the discovered sources is analyzed using 1-arcminute line data\nfrom neutral hydrogen (HI) and 45-arcsecond 12CO(J=1-0). G152.4-2.1 is a barrel\nshaped SNR with two opposed radio-bright polarized flanks on the North and\nSouth. The remnant, which is elongated along the Galactic plane is evolving in\na more-or-less uniform medium. G190.9-2.2 is also a shell-type remnant with\nEast and West halves elongated perpendicular to the plane, and is evolving\nwithin a low-density region bounded by dense neutral hydrogen in the North and\nSouth, and molecular (12CO) clouds in the East and West. The integrated radio\ncontinuum spectral indices are -0.65+/-0.05 and -0.66+/-0.05 for G152.4-2.1 and\nG190.9-2.2 respectively. Both SNRs are approximately 1 kpc distant, with\nG152.4-2.1 being larger (32x30 pc in diameter) than G190.9-2.2 (18x16 pc).\nThese two remnants are the lowest surface brightness SNRs yet catalogued at\n5x10^-23 W m^-2 Hz^-1 sr^-1.\n","Comment: Published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, January 2013 Vol. 549, Article\n  No. A107, 9 pages"]}]
