In this work, the\ncapacity gain achieved through CoMP transmission is studied in various models\nof wireless networks that have practical significance. The capacity gain is\nanalyzed through the degrees of freedom (DoF) criterion. The DoF available for\ncommunication provides an analytically tractable way to characterize the\ncapacity of interference channels. The considered channel model has K\ntransmitter/receiver pairs, and each receiver is interested in one unique\nmessage from a set of K independent messages. Each message can be available at\nmore than one transmitter. The maximum number of transmitters at which each\nmessage can be available, is defined as the cooperation order M. For fully\nconnected interference channels, it is shown that the asymptotic per user DoF,\nas K goes to infinity, remains at 1/2 as M is increased from 1 to 2.\nFurthermore, the same negative result is shown to hold for all M > 1 for any\nmessage assignment that satisfies a local cooperation constraint. On the other\nhand, when the assumption of full connectivity is relaxed to local\nconnectivity, and each transmitter is connected only to its own receiver as\nwell as L neighboring receivers, it is shown that local cooperation is optimal.\nThe asymptotic per user DoF is shown to be at least max {1/2,2M/(2M+L)} for\nlocally connected channels, and is shown to be 2M/(2M+1) for the special case\nof Wyner's asymmetric model where L=1. An interesting feature of the proposed\nachievability scheme is that it relies on simple zero-forcing transmit beams\nand does not require symbol extensions. Also, to achieve the optimal per user\nDoF for Wyner's model, messages are assigned to transmitters in an asymmetric\nfashion unlike traditional assignments where message i has to be available at\ntransmitter i.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

For most\namino acids there are multiple synonymous codons that can encode the amino\nacid. The translation speed can vary from one codon to another, thus there is\nroom for changing the ribosome speed while keeping the amino acid sequence and\nhence the resulting protein. Recently, it has been noticed that the choice of\nthe synonymous codon, via the resulting distribution of slow- and\nfast-translated codons, affects not only on the average speed of one ribosome\ntranslating the messenger RNA (mRNA) but also might have an effect on nearby\nribosomes by affecting the appearance of \"traffic jams\" where multiple\nribosomes collide and form queues. To test this \"context effect\" further, we\nhere investigate the effect of the sequence of synonymous codons on the\nribosome traffic by using a ribosome traffic model with codon-dependent rates,\nestimated from experiments. We compare the ribosome traffic on wild type\nsequences and sequences where the synonymous codons were swapped randomly. By\nsimulating translation of 87 genes, we demonstrate that the wild type\nsequences, especially those with a high bias in codon usage, tend to have the\nability to reduce ribosome collisions, hence optimizing the cellular investment\nin the translation apparatus. The magnitude of such reduction of the\ntranslation time might have a significant impact on the cellular growth rate\nand thereby have importance for the survival of the species.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 Figures.

However, the amount of spectrum that can be used to\nsatisfy these demands remains finite. This leads to a great challenge for\nwireless users to effectively share the spectrum to achieve their QoS\nrequirements. This paper presents a game theoretic model for spectrum sharing,\nwhere users seek to satisfy their QoS demands in a distributed fashion. Our\nspectrum sharing model is quite general, because we allow different wireless\nchannels to provide different QoS, depending upon their channel conditions and\nhow many users are trying to access them. Also, users can be highly\nheterogeneous, with different QoS demands, depending upon their activities,\nhardware capabilities, and technology choices. Under such a general setting, we\nshow that it is NP hard to find a spectrum allocation which satisfies the\nmaximum number of users' QoS requirements in a centralized fashion. We also\nshow that allowing users to self-organize through distributed channel\nselections is a viable alternative to the centralized optimization, because\nbetter response updating is guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibria in\npolynomial time. By bounding the price of anarchy, we demonstrate that the\nworst case pure Nash equilibrium can be close to optimal, when users and\nchannels are not very heterogenous. We also extend our model by considering the\nfrequency spatial reuse, and consider the user interactions as a game upon a\ngraph where players only contend with their neighbors. We prove that better\nresponse updating is still guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibrium in this\nmore general spatial QoS satisfaction game.\n","Comment: The paper has been accepted by IEEE Journal of Selected Areas in\n  Communications (JSAC)"]}]

In a viral marketing campaign, a firm initially\ntargets a small set of pioneers and hopes that they would influence a sizeable\nfraction of the population by diffusion of influence through the network. In\ngeneral, any marketing campaign might fail to go viral in the first try. As\nsuch, it would be useful to have some guide to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe campaign and judge whether it is worthy of further resources, and in case\nthe campaign has potential, how to hit upon a good pioneer who can make the\ncampaign go viral. In this paper, we present a diffusion model developed by\nenriching the generalized random graph (a.k.a. configuration model) to provide\ninsight into these questions. We offer the intuition behind the results on this\nmodel, rigorously proved in Blaszczyszyn & Gaurav(2013), and illustrate them\nhere by taking examples of random networks having prototypical degree\ndistributions - Poisson degree distribution, which is commonly used as a kind\nof benchmark, and Power Law degree distribution, which is normally used to\napproximate the real-world networks. On these networks, the members are assumed\nto have varying attitudes towards propagating the information. We analyze three\ncases, in particular - (1) Bernoulli transmissions, when a member influences\neach of its friend with probability p; (2) Node percolation, when a member\ninfluences all its friends with probability p and none with probability 1-p;\n(3) Coupon-collector transmissions, when a member randomly selects one of his\nfriends K times with replacement. We assume that the configuration model is the\nclosest approximation of a large online social network, when the information\navailable about the network is very limited. The key insight offered by this\nstudy from a firm's perspective is regarding how to evaluate the effectiveness\nof a marketing campaign and do cost-benefit analysis by collecting relevant\nstatistical data from the pioneers it selects. The campaign evaluation\ncriterion is informed by the observation that if the parameters of the\nunderlying network and the campaign effectiveness are such that the campaign\ncan indeed reach a significant fraction of the population, then the set of good\npioneers also forms a significant fraction of the population. Therefore, in\nsuch a case, the firms can even adopt the naive strategy of repeatedly picking\nand targeting some number of pioneers at random from the population. With this\nstrategy, the probability of them picking a good pioneer will increase\ngeometrically fast with the number of tries.\n"]}]

When applied to time series from 39 countries,\nthis method reveals a well-defined power law in the relative per capita GDP\ncontractions that span from 5.53% to 50%, comprising 263 events. However, this\nobservation does not suffice to attribute recessions to some specific\nmechanism, such as self-organized criticality. The paper highlights a set of\npoints requiring more study so as to discriminate among models compatible with\nthe power law, as needed to develop sound tools for the management of\nrecessions.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Compression techniques dedicated to such meshes have emerged, which\nexploit the idea that the connectivity of a dense mesh does not deviate much\nfrom the connectivity that can be constructed automatically from the vertex\npositions (while possibly being guided by additional codes). The edge flip is\none of the tools that can encode the differences between two meshes, and it is\nimportant to control the length of a sequence of flips that transform one\ntriangulation into another. This paper provides a practical solution to this\nproblem. Indeed, the problem of determining a minimal sequence of edge flips\nbetween two triangulations is NP-complete for some types of triangulations\nincluding manifold triangulations of surfaces, so that it is necessary to\ndevelop heuristics. Moreover, it is sometimes difficult to establish a first\nsequence of flips between two meshes, and we advocate a solution based on the\nreduction of an existing sequence. The new approach we propose is founded on\nthe assignment of labels to identify the edges, with a property of label\ntransfer during a flip. This gives a meaning to the tracking of an edge in a\nsequence of flips and offers the exploitation of very simple combinatorial\nproperties. All the operations are performed directly on the sequence of labels\ndenoting the edges to be flipped, almost regardless of the underlying surface,\nsince only local temporary connectivity is involved.\n","Comment: 15 pages, submitted in ESA 2013"]}]
