The underlying Bloch equations describe the state\nevolution of the two-level system and allow characterising both energy and\nphase relaxation processes in a simple yet powerful manner.\n  Here we demonstrate the realisation of a nanomechanical two-level system\nwhich is driven by radio frequency signals. It allows to extend the above Bloch\nsphere formalism to nanoelectromechanical systems. Our realisation is based on\nthe two orthogonal fundamental flexural modes of a high quality factor\nnanostring resonator which are strongly coupled by a dielectric gradient field.\nFull Bloch sphere control is demonstrated via Rabi, Ramsey and Hahn echo\nexperiments. This allows manipulating the classical superposition state of the\ncoupled modes in amplitude and phase and enables deep insight into the\ndecoherence mechanisms of nanomechanical systems. We have determined the energy\nrelaxation time T1 and phase relaxation times T2 and T2*, and find them all to\nbe equal. This not only indicates that energy relaxation is the dominating\nsource of decoherence, but also demonstrates that reversible dephasing\nprocesses are negligible in such collective mechanical modes. We thus conclude\nthat not only T1 but also T2 can be increased by engineering larger mechanical\nquality factors.

In consequence of this,\nmagnetic null points can develop by purely geometrical effects of the strong\ngravitational field and the frame-dragging mechanism.

In order to understand such forces more deeply, we perform 2D\nsoft-sphere molecular dynamics simulation, on similar set up, of an intruder\ndragged through a 50-50 bi-disperse granular packing, with diameters 0.30 and\n0.34 cm. We measure, for both circular and half-circle shapes, the forces\nparallel (drag) and perpendicular (lift) to the drag direction as functions of\nthe drag speed, with V=10.3-309 cm/s, and intruder depths, with D=3.75-37.5 cm.\nThe drag forces on an intruder monotonically increase with V and D, and are\nlarger for the circle. However, the lift force does not depend monotonically on\nV and D, and this relationship is affected by the shape of the intruder. The\nvertical force was negative for the half-circle, but for a small range of V and\nD, we measure positive lift. We find no sign change for the lift on the circle,\nwhich is always positive. The explanation for the nonmonotonic dependence is\nrelated to the decrease in contacts on the intruder as V increases. This is\nqualitatively similar to supersonic flow detachment from an obstacle. The\ndetachment picture is supported by simulation measurements of the velocity\nfield around the intruder and force profiles measured on its surface.\n","Comment: 25 figures, PRE preprint format"]}]

To the best of our knowledge, the\nprevious works only studied the asymptotic outage performance of the parallel\nfading channel which are only valid for a large number of subchannels or high\nSNRs. In this paper, a unified performance metric, which we shall refer to as\nthe outage exponent, will be proposed.

It is shown that the\nproposed outage exponent is not only an accurate estimation of the outage\nprobability for any number of subchannels, any SNR, and any target transmission\nrate, but also provides an easy way to compute the outage capacity, finite-SNR\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff, and SNR gain. The asymptotic performance\nmetrics, such as the delay-limited capacity, ergodic capacity, and\ndiversity-multiplexing tradeoff can be directly obtained by letting the number\nof subchannels or SNR tends to infinity. Similar to Gallager's error exponent,\na reliable function for parallel fading channels, which illustrates a\nfundamental relationship between the transmission reliability and efficiency,\ncan also be defined from the outage exponent.

To investigate the first stages of the process of high-mass\nstar formation, we selected a sample of massive clumps previously observed with\nthe SEST at 1.2 mm and with the ATNF ATCA at 1.3 cm. We want to characterize\nthe physical conditions in such sources, and test whether their properties\ndepend on the evolutionary stage of the clump.\n  Methods. With ATCA we observed the selected sources in the NH3(1,1) and (2,2)\ntransitions and in the 22 GHz H2O maser line. Ammonia lines are a good\ntemperature probe that allow us to accurately determine the mass and the\ncolumn-, volume-, and surface densities of the clumps. We also collected all\ndata available to construct the spectral energy distribution of the individual\nclumps and to determine if star formation is already occurring, through\nobservations of its most common signposts, thus putting constraints on the\nevolutionary stage of the source. We fitted the spectral energy distribution\nbetween 1.2 mm and 70 microns with a modified black body to derive the dust\ntemperature and independently determine the mass.\n  Results. The clumps are cold (T~10-30 K), massive (M~10^2-10^3 Mo), and dense\n(n(H2)>~10^5 cm^-3) and they have high column densities (N(H2)~10^23 cm^-2).\nAll clumps appear to be potentially able to form high-mass stars. The most\nmassive clumps appear to be gravitationally unstable, if the only sources of\nsupport against collapse are turbulence and thermal pressure, which possibly\nindicates that the magnetic field is important in stabilizing them.\n  Conclusions. After investigating how the average properties depend on the\nevolutionary phase of the source, we find that the temperature and central\ndensity progressively increase with time.
