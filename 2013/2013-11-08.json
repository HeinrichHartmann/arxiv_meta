A\nbasic question here is whether the information of the assignment at the root\naffects the distribution of the colourings at the leaves. This is the so-called\nreconstruction/non-reconstruction problem. It is well known that d/ln d is a\nthreshold function for this problem, i.e.\n  * if k \\geq (1+\\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root has a vanishing\neffect on the distribution of the colourings at the leaves, as the height of\nthe tree grows\n  * if $k\\leq (1-\\eps)d/ln d, then the colouring of the root biases the\ndistribution of the colouring of the leaves regardless of the height of the\ntree.\n  There is no apparent combinatorial reason why such a result should be true.\n  When k\\geq (1+\\eps)d/ ln d, the threshold implies the following: We can\ncouple two broadcasting processes that assign the root different colours such\nthat the probability of having disagreement at the leaves reduces with their\ndistance from the root. It is natural to perceive such coupling as a mapping\nfrom the colouring of the first broadcasting process to the colouring of the\nsecond one. Here, we study how can we have such a mapping \"combinatorially\".\nDevising a mapping where the disagreements vanish as we move away from the root\nturns out to be a non-trivial task to accomplish for any k \\leq d.\n  In this work we obtain a coupling which has the aforementioned property for\nany k>3d/ln d, i.e. much smaller than d. Interestingly enough, the decisions\nthat we make in the coupling are local.

How\nthese adaptation currents change the relationship between in-vivo like\nfluctuating synaptic input, spike rate output and the spike train statistics,\nhowever, is not well understood. In this computational study we show that an\nadaptation current which primarily depends on the subthreshold membrane voltage\nchanges the neuronal input-output relationship (I-O curve) subtractively,\nthereby increasing the response threshold. A spike-dependent adaptation current\nalters the I-O curve divisively, thus reducing the response gain. Both types of\nadaptation currents naturally increase the mean inter-spike interval (ISI), but\nthey can affect ISI variability in opposite ways. A subthreshold current always\ncauses an increase of variability while a spike-triggered current decreases\nhigh variability caused by fluctuation-dominated inputs and increases low\nvariability when the average input is large.

Solvers\nrelying on a boundary integral representation typically do not consider\nfeatures like solvent-filled cavities or ion-exclusion (Stern) layers, due to\nthe added difficulty of treating multiple boundary surfaces.

The results suggest that if required accuracy for an\napplication allows errors larger than about 2%, then the simpler,\nsingle-surface model can be used. When calculating binding energies, the need\nfor a multi-surface model is problem-dependent, becoming more critical when\nligand and receptor are of comparable size.

It is proven that\nthe fractional programming problem considered is quasi-concave so that\nDinkelbach's method may be employed for finding the optimal solution at a low\ncomplexity. This method solves the above-mentioned master problem by solving a\nseries of parameterized concave secondary problems. These secondary problems\nare solved using a dual decomposition approach, where each secondary problem is\nfurther decomposed into a number of similar subproblems. The impact of various\nsystem parameters on the attainable EE and SE of the system employing both EE\nmaximization (EEM) and SE maximization (SEM) algorithms is characterized. In\nparticular, it is observed that increasing the number of relays for a range of\ncell sizes, although marginally increases the attainable SE, reduces the EE\nsignificantly. It is noted that the highest SE and EE are achieved, when the\nrelays are placed closer to the BS to take advantage of the resultant\nline-of-sight link. Furthermore, increasing both the number of available\nsubcarriers and the number of active user equipment (UE) increases both the EE\nand the total SE of the system as a benefit of the increased frequency and\nmulti-user diversity, respectively. Finally, it is demonstrated that as\nexpected, increasing the available power tends to improve the SE, when using\nthe SEM algorithm. By contrast, given a sufficiently high available power, the\nEEM algorithm attains the maximum achievable EE and a suboptimal SE.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, published on IEEE Transactions on\n  Communications, vol. 61, no. 7, pp. 2746-2757, Jul. 2013"]}]

Under the presence of external electric fields\na rearrangement of $RA$ emission spectra is possible to associate with\nmanifestations of the Stark effect.

Distributional semantics presupposes that the meanings of words are\na function of their occurrences in textual contexts.

The problem of compositionality for such models concerns\nitself with how to produce representations for larger units of text by\ncomposing the representations of smaller units of text.\n  This thesis focuses on a particular approach to this compositionality\nproblem, namely using the categorical framework developed by Coecke, Sadrzadeh,\nand Clark, which combines syntactic analysis formalisms with distributional\nsemantic representations of meaning to produce syntactically motivated\ncomposition operations. This thesis shows how this approach can be\ntheoretically extended and practically implemented to produce concrete\ncompositional distributional models of natural language semantics.

The function of\ninternal galeal muscle which exists along proboscis is to adjust the line\ntension. The knee bend shape is due to the local maximal spontaneous curvature\nand is an advantage for nectar-feeding butterfly. When there is no knee bend,\nthe proboscis of fruit-piercing butterfly is easy to achieve the piercing\nmovement which induced by the increase of internal hydraulic pressure.

Exploiting\nthe inhomogeneity of such materials to design next-generation nanodevices\nrequires a band structure probe with nanoscale spatial resolution. To address\nthis demand, we report the first simultaneous observation and quantitative\nreconciliation of two candidate probes - Landau level spectroscopy and\nquasiparticle interference imaging - which we employ here to reconstruct the\nmulti-component surface state band structure of the topological semimetal\nantimony(Sb). We thus establish the technique of band structure tunneling\nmicroscopy (BSTM), whose unique advantages include nanoscale access to\nnon-rigid band structure deformation, empty state dispersion, and magnetic\nfield dependent states. We use BSTM to elucidate the relationship between bulk\nconductivity and surface state robustness in topological materials, and to\nquantify essential metrics for spintronics applications.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Each uses linear space and can be constructed in\nlinear time for polynomially sized alphabets. However, when it comes to\nanswering queries with worst-case deterministic time bounds, the prior does so\nin $O(m\\log|\\Sigma|)$ time, where $m$ is the query size, $|\\Sigma|$ is the\nalphabet size, and the latter does so in $O(m+\\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the\ntext size. If one wants to output all appearances of the query, an additive\ncost of $O(occ)$ time is sufficient, where $occ$ is the size of the output.\n  We propose a novel way of combining the two into, what we call, a {\\em suffix\ntray}. The space and construction time remain linear and the query time\nimproves to $O(m+\\log|\\Sigma|)$ for integer alphabets from a linear range, i.e.\n$\\Sigma \\subset \\{1,\\cdots, cn\\}$, for an arbitrary constant $c$. The\nconstruction and query are deterministic. Here also an additive $O(occ)$ time\nis sufficient if one desires to output all appearances of the query.\n  We also consider the online version of indexing, where the text arrives\nonline, one character at a time, and indexing queries are answered in tandem.\nIn this variant we create a cross between a suffix tree and a suffix list (a\ndynamic variant of suffix array) to be called a {\\em suffix trist}; it supports\nqueries in $O(m+\\log|\\Sigma|)$ time. The suffix trist also uses linear space.\nFurthermore, if there exists an online construction for a linear-space suffix\ntree such that the cost of adding a character is worst-case deterministic\n$f(n,|\\Sigma|)$ ($n$ is the size of the current text), then one can further\nupdate the suffix trist in $O(f(n,|\\Sigma|)+\\log |\\Sigma|)$ time.
