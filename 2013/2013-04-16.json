Usually the origin is\ninferred by running a trajectory model (stochastic or deterministic) in\nreverse.

An iterative refinement process named BAKTRAK is employed\nwhere those trajectories that do not make it to the goal are rejected and new\ntrajectories are spawned from successful trajectories. This allows the model to\nbe run in the forward direction to determine the point of origin of a drifting\nobject.

Null models play an important\nrole both in the optimization of quality functions such as modularity and in\nthe subsequent assessment of the statistical validity of identified community\nstructure. We examine the sensitivity of such methods to model parameters and\nshow how comparisons to null models can help identify system scales. By\nconsidering a large number of optimizations, we quantify the variance of\nnetwork diagnostics over optimizations (`optimization variance') and over\nrandomizations of network structure (`randomization variance'). Because the\nmodularity quality function typically has a large number of nearly-degenerate\nlocal optima for networks constructed using real data, we develop a method to\nconstruct representative partitions that uses a null model to correct for\nstatistical noise in sets of partitions. To illustrate our results, we employ\nensembles of time-dependent networks extracted from both nonlinear oscillators\nand empirical neuroscience data.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 11 figures"]}]

In this context, we present in this paper a more accurate\nsimple process to speed up ML methods. An unsupervised clustering algorithm is\ncombined with Expectation, Maximization (EM) algorithm to develop an efficient\nHidden Markov Model (HMM) training. The idea of the proposed process consists\nof two steps. In the first step, training instances with similar inputs are\nclustered and a weight factor which represents the frequency of these instances\nis assigned to each representative cluster. Dynamic Time Warping technique is\nused as a dissimilarity function to cluster similar examples. In the second\nstep, all formulas in the classical HMM training algorithm (EM) associated with\nthe number of training instances are modified to include the weight factor in\nappropriate terms. This process significantly accelerates HMM training while\nmaintaining the same initial, transition and emission probabilities matrixes as\nthose obtained with the classical HMM training algorithm. Accordingly, the\nclassification accuracy is preserved. Depending on the size of the training\nset, speedups of up to 2200 times is possible when the size is about 100.000\ninstances.

Although the core molecular machinery for actin\nnetwork growth is well preserved in most cases, the geometry of the propelled\nobstacle can vary considerably. In recent years, filament orientation\ndistribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the\nstructure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several\ncontinuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing\nbehind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady\nstate orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete\nfilaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate\nthat for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation\npatterns peaked at either +35/-35 or +70/0/-70 degrees exhibit mutually\nexclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of\nvery large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a\nfunction of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to\nobstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at\na partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good\nagreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same\ntwo fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an\nappropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the\nobstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network\narchitectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective\nof obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data\nhave to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.\n","Comment: revtex, 36 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Normally, the superconducting transition\ntemperature Tc should be strongly suppressed at the S-F interface owing to the\npenetration of Cooper pairs into the ferromagnetic side. Nevertheless,\nconstructive interactions between S and F orders have been suggested to occur\nvia the modification of ferromagnetic order by the superconducting state. This\nmay induce an inhomogeneous magnetic state, often called a cryptoferromagnetic\nstate, and the relevant domain wall effect, which will lead to a local decrease\nof the pair-breaking parameter.

Our objective is to estimate their X-ray peak\nfluxes from EUVI data by finding a relation of the EUVI with GOES X-ray fluxes.\nBecause of the presence of the Fe xxiv line at 192 A, the response of the EUVI\n195 A channel has a secondary broad peak around 15 MK, and its fluxes closely\ntrace X-ray fluxes during the rise phase of flares. If the flare plasma is\nisothermal, the EUVI flux should be directly proportional to the GOES flux. In\nreality, the multithermal nature of the flare and other factors complicate the\nestimation of the X-ray fluxes from EUVI observations. We discuss the uncer-\ntainties, by comparing GOES fluxes with the high cadence EUV data from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). We conclude that the EUVI 195 A data can provide estimates of the X-ray\npeak fluxes of intense flares (e.g., above M4 in the GOES scale) with\nuncertainties of a factor of a few.

The model includes stacking,\nhydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions as fundamental components in\ndescribing the stability of RNA structures. The stacking interactions are\nparametrized using a set of nucleotide-specific parameters, which were\ncalibrated against the thermodynamic measurements for single-base stacks and\nbase-pair stacks. All hydrogen bonds are assumed to have the same strength,\nregardless of their context in the RNA structure. The ionic buffer is modeled\nimplicitly, using the concept of counterion condensation and the Debye-H\\\"uckel\ntheory. The three adjustable parameters in the model were determined by fitting\nthe experimental data for two RNA hairpins and a pseudoknot. A single set of\nparameters provides good agreement with thermodynamic data for the three RNA\nmolecules over a wide range of temperatures and salt concentrations. In the\nprocess of calibrating the model, we establish the extent of counterion\ncondensation onto the single-stranded RNA backbone. The reduced backbone charge\nis independent of the ionic strength and is 60% of the RNA bare charge at 37\ndegrees Celsius. Our model can be used to predict the folding thermodynamics\nfor any RNA molecule in the presence of monovalent ions.\n"]}]
