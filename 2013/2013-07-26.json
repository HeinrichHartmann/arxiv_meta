Recent experiments reveal that the switching\ndynamics of the motor depends on the motor rotation speed, and thus the motor\ntorque, non-monotonically. Here we present a unified mathematical model which\nmodels motor torque generation based on experimental torque-speed curves and\ntorque-dependent switching based on the conformational spread model. The model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed switching rate as a function of the\nrotation speed, and provides a generic physical explanation independent of most\ndetails. A stator affects the switching dynamics through two mechanisms:\naccelerating the conformation flipping rates of individual rotor switching\nunits, which favours slower motor speed and thus increasing torque; and\naffecting more switching units within unit time, which favours faster speed.\nConsequently, the switching rate shows a maximum at intermediate speed. Our\nmodel predicts that a motor switches more often with more stators. The\nload-switching relation may serve as a mechanism for sensing the physical\nenvironment, similar to the chemotaxis system for sensing the chemical\nenvironment. It may also coordinate the switch dynamics of motors within a\ncell.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The\npresent paper analyses such Coxeter groups in the Clifford Geometric Algebra\nframework, which affords a simple way of performing reflections and rotations\nwhilst exposing more clearly the underlying geometry. The Clifford approach\nshows that the quaternionic representations in fact have very simple geometric\ninterpretations. The representations of the groups A_1 x A_1 x A_1, A_3, B_3\nand H_3 of rank 3 in terms of pure quaternions are shown to be simply the Hodge\ndualised root vectors, which determine the reflection planes of the Coxeter\ngroups. Two successive reflections result in a rotation, described by the\ngeometric product of the two reflection vectors, giving a Clifford spinor. The\nspinors for the rank-3 groups A_1 x A_1 x A_1, A_3, B_3 and H_3 yield a new\nsimple construction of binary polyhedral groups. These in turn generate the\ngroups A_1 x A_1 x A_1 x A_1, D_4, F_4 and H_4 of rank 4, and their widely used\nquaternionic representations are shown to be spinors in disguise. Therefore,\nthe Clifford geometric product in fact induces the rank-4 groups from the\nrank-3 groups.

In existing Tiny Two Way Buffer System, both generators\nproduce packets in half duplex manner in no time, deterministic time, and non\ndeterministic time. Analysis of the model for above time options leads the\nmodel in deadlock. The model can be out of the deadlock if timings in the model\nis incorporated in alternative fashion.

Our study thus addresses the question of whether\nor not non-Fermi liquids, like Fermi liquids, are unstable towards the\nformation of superconductivity.The results are (i) the non-Fermi liquid is\nstable against superconductivity below a critical gauge coupling, (ii) above\nthis critical coupling, the ground state is an unconventional superconductor\nwith angular momentum $\\ell \\ge 2$. Our results are obtained from a solution of\nthe Dyson-Nambu equation. Note that in this problem there is a quantum critical\npoint between a non-Fermi liquid state and the superconducting state, as the\ncritical coupling is nonzero. This is in contrast to a weakly coupled metal,\nwhich exhibits superconductivity for infinitesimally weak interaction\nregardless of its sign.\n","Comment: 8 pages and 10 figures"]}]

We also consider the CIV lambda1549 BEL. The lack of a\nstrong correlation between Lyman alpha BEL variability and nearby continuum\nvariability is consistent with the presence of a time lag between the\nvariations, whereas the presence of a stronger correlation between Lyman alpha\nBEL variability and CIV BEL variability suggests that these BEL regions (BELRs)\nare at similar distances from the central ionizing source. Some interesting\nexamples are high-lighted in the analysis, including a case where the flux of\nan Lyman alpha BEL increased by ~26% in 14 days in the quasar rest frame,\nsuggesting that the BELR has the shape of a disc, which is being observed\nface-on.

Our model reflects the main features of popular real-world APIs such\nas SHMEM, ARMCI, GASNet, GPI, and GASPI.\n  A key feature of PGAS is the support for one-sided communication: a node may\ndirectly read and write the memory located at a remote node, without explicit\nsynchronization with the processes running on the remote side.

The requirement is finer than the\nclassical data race freedom and rules out most false error reports.\n  Our main result is an algorithm for checking robustness of PGAS programs.

It is shown that the phenomenon of macroscopic quantization has the\nclear physical origin in that case. It follows from the angular momentum\nconservation combined with momentum quantization for bare particle on the ring\n. The existence an observable which can take only integer values in the zero\ntemperature limit is rigorously proved. With the aid of the mapping between\nparticle on the ring and Ambegaokar-Eckern-Schon model, which can be used to\ndescribe single-electron devices, it is demonstrated that this observable is\nanalogous to the \"effective charge\" introduced by Burmistrov and Pruisken for\nthe single-electron box problem. Different consequences of the revealed physics\nare discussed, as well as a generalization of the obtained results to the case\nof more complicated systems.\n","Comment: 4.5 pages"]}]

A negative example"],"description":["  $l^q$-regularization has been demonstrated to be an attractive technique in\nmachine learning and statistical modeling. It attempts to improve the\ngeneralization (prediction) capability of a machine (model) through\nappropriately shrinking its coefficients. The shape of a $l^q$ estimator\ndiffers in varying choices of the regularization order $q$. In particular,\n$l^1$ leads to the LASSO estimate, while $l^{2}$ corresponds to the smooth\nridge regression. This makes the order $q$ a potential tuning parameter in\napplications. To facilitate the use of $l^{q}$-regularization, we intend to\nseek for a modeling strategy where an elaborative selection on $q$ is\navoidable. In this spirit, we place our investigation within a general\nframework of $l^{q}$-regularized kernel learning under a sample dependent\nhypothesis space (SDHS). For a designated class of kernel functions, we show\nthat all $l^{q}$ estimators for $0< q < \\infty$ attain similar generalization\nerror bounds. These estimated bounds are almost optimal in the sense that up to\na logarithmic factor, the upper and lower bounds are asymptotically identical.\nThis finding tentatively reveals that, in some modeling contexts, the choice of\n$q$ might not have a strong impact in terms of the generalization capability.\nFrom this perspective, $q$ can be arbitrarily specified, or specified merely by\nother no generalization criteria like smoothness, computational complexity,\nsparsity, etc..\n","Comment: 35 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In this paper we shall study a specific instance of Voloshin's\nidea: a non-monochromatic non-rainbow (NMNR) colouring of a hypergraph is a\ncolouring of its vertices such that every edge has at least two vertices\ncoloured with different colours (non-monochromatic) and no edge has all of its\nvertices coloured with distinct colours (non-rainbow). Perhaps the most\nintriguing phenomenon of such colourings is that a hypergraph can have gaps in\nits NMNR chromatic spectrum, that is, for some $k_1 < k_2 < k_3$, the\nhypergraph is NMNR colourable with $k_1$ and with $k_3$ colours but not with\n$k_2$ colours.\n  Several beautiful examples have been constructed of NMNR colourings of\nhypergraphs exhibiting phenomena not seen in classical colourings.
