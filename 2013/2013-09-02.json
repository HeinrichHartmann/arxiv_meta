This may be understood through the sub-unity exponent found in\nthe scaling relation we derive between the BCG mass and cluster mass over the\nhalo mass range 10^13 < M500 < 10^15Msol and the lack of correlation between\nradio luminosity and cluster mass, such that BCG AGN in groups can have\nrelatively more energetic influence on the ICM. The Lx - Tx relation for\nsystems with the most massive BCGs, or those with BCGs co-located with the peak\nof the ICM emission, is steeper than that for those with the least massive and\nmost offset, which instead follows self-similarity. This is evidence that a\ncombination of central gas cooling and powerful, well fuelled AGN causes the\ndeparture of the ICM from pure gravitational heating, with the steepened\nrelation crossing self-similarity at Tx = 2 keV. Importantly, regardless of\ntheir black hole mass, BCGs are more likely to host radio-loud AGN if they are\nin a massive cluster (Tx > 2 keV) and again co-located with an effective fuel\nsupply of dense, cooling gas. This demonstrates that the most massive black\nholes appear to know more about their host cluster than they do about their\nhost galaxy.

Once this trend in sSFR is\nremoved we see no evidence for an increase in the number density of\nstar-forming galaxies or the merger rate with redshift.

Surfaces are specified via a\ncollection of smooth parameterizations given on triangles, a setting which\ngeneralizes the typical one of triangulated surfaces, and the integral\nequations are discretized via a high-order Nystrom method. This allows for\nrapid convergence in cases in which high-order surface information is\navailable. The high-order discretization technique is coupled with a direct\nsolver based on the recursive construction of scattering matrices. The result\nis a solver which often attains $O(N^{1.5})$ complexity in the number of\ndiscretization nodes $N$ and which is resistant to many of the pathologies\nwhich stymie iterative solvers in the numerical simulation of scattering. The\nperformance of the algorithm is illustrated with numerical experiments which\ninvolve the simulation of scattering from a variety of domains, including one\nconsisting of a collection of 1000 ellipsoids with randomly oriented semiaxes\narranged in a grid, and a domain whose boundary has 12 curved edges and 8\ncorner points.\n"]}]

In this paper, we propose an alternating\nminimization algorithm for the continuous version of the total variation image\ndeblurring problem. We establish convergence of the proposed continuous\nalternating minimization algorithm. The continuous setting is very useful to\nhave a unifying representation of the algorithm, independently of the discrete\napproximation of the deconvolution problem, in particular concerning the\nstrategies for dealing with boundary artifacts. Indeed, an accurate restoration\nof blurred and noisy images requires a proper treatment of the boundary. A\ndiscrete version of our continuous alternating minimization algorithm is\nobtained following two different strategies: the imposition of appropriate\nboundary conditions and the enlargement of the domain. The first one is\ncomputationally useful in the case of a symmetric blur, while the second one\ncan be efficiently applied for a nonsymmetric blur. Numerical tests show that\nour algorithm generates higher quality images in comparable running times with\nrespect to the Fast Total Variation deconvolution algorithm.\n"]}]

However, consimilarity\ntransformations imply a physically unrealistic antilinear time-reversal\noperation. This is just one of the approaches found in literature to the\ndescription of transformations where the role of conjugation has been\nmisunderstood. In this paper, the different approaches are examined in\nparticular in respect to the role of conjugation. In order to justify and\ncorrectly derive the congruential rule for polarization basis transformation\nand properly place the role of conjugation, the origin of the problem is traced\nback to the derivation of the antenna hight from the transmitted field. In\nfact, careful consideration of the role played by the Green's dyadic operator\nrelating the antenna height to the transmitted field shows that, under general\nunitary basis transformation, it is not justified to assume a scalar\nrelationship between them. Invariance of the voltage equation shows that\nantenna states and wave states must in fact lie in dual spaces, a distinction\nnot captured in conventional Jones vector formalism. Introducing spinor\nformalism, and with the use of an alternate spin frame for the transmitted\nfield a mathematically consistent implementation of the directional wave\nformalism is obtained. Examples are given comparing the wider generality of the\ncongruential rule in both active and passive transformations with the\nconsimilarity rule.\n"]}]

A bi-Cayley graph $\\bcay(G,S)$\nis called a BCI-graph if for any bi-Cayley graph $\\bcay(G,T),$ $\\bcay(G,S)\n\\cong \\bcay(G,T)$ implies that $T = g S^\\alpha$ for some $g \\in G$ and $\\alpha\n\\in \\aut(G)$. A group $G$ is called an $m$-BCI-group if all bi-Cayley graphs of\n$G$ of valency at most $m$ are BCI-graphs.In this paper we prove that, a finite\nnilpotent group is a 3-BCI-group if and only if it is in the form $U \\times V,$\nwhere $U$ is a homocyclic group of odd order, and $V$ is trivial or one of the\ngroups $\\Z_{2^r},$ $\\Z_2^r$ and $\\Q_8$.\n"]}]
