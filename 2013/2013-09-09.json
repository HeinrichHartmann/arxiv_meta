Yet practical receiver\ndesigns impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical\ncircuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode\nthe carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a\ngeneral receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits\nthe received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and\ninformation decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time\nswitching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS)\nare investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of\nOPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures,\nnamely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The\nintegrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated\nreceiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for\nthe two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E)\nregion. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different\nrate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into\naccount, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers.

In the relativistic heavy ion accelerators, specially\nthe RHIC and LHC colliders, it became possible to study not only fluids made of\nhadronic matter but also fluids of quarks and gluons. Part of the physics\nprogram of these machines is the observation of waves in this strongly\ninteracting medium. From the theoretical point of view, these waves are often\ntreated with li-nearized hydrodynamics. In this text we review the attempts to\ngo beyond linearization. We show how to use the Reductive Perturbation Method\nto expand the equations of (ideal and viscous) relativistic hydrodynamics to\nobtain nonlinear wave equations. These nonlinear wave equations govern the\nevolution of energy density perturbations (in hot quark gluon plasma) or baryon\ndensity perturbations (in cold quark gluon plasma and nuclear matter).\nDifferent nonlinear wave equations, such as the breaking wave, Korteweg-de\nVries and Burgers equations, are obtained from different equations of state\n(EOS). In nuclear matter, the Walecka EOS may lead to a KdV equation. We\nexplore equations of state such as those extracted from the MIT Bag Model and\nfrom QCD in the mean field theory approach. Some of these equations are\nintegrable and have analytical solitonic solutions. We derive these equations\nalso in spherical and cylindrical coordinates. We extend the analysis to two\nand three dimensions to obtain the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, which\nis the generalization of the KdV. The KP is also integrable and presents\nanalytical solitonic solutions.

DSD refers to the intrinsic\nfluctuating, inhomogeneous structure of such nano-scale systems. In contrast to\nbulk materials, nano-scale systems exhibit substantial fluctuations in energy,\ncharge, and other extensive quantities as well as large surface effects. The\nDSD is driven by the stochastic librational motion of the center of mass and\nfluxional bonding at the nanoparticle surface due to thermal coupling with the\nsubstrate. Our approach for calculating DSD is based on a combination of\nstatistical mechanics, transient coupled-oscillator models, and real-time\nDFT/MD simulations. This approach treats thermal and dynamic effects over\nmultiple time-scales, including bond-stretching and -bending vibrations, DSD,\nand transient tethering to the substrate at longer ps time-scales.
