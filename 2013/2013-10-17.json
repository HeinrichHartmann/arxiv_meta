Our multi-wavelength monitoring establishes the\nrise time dt = 9-23 days and shows an NUV-NIR SED with temperature > 17x10^3 K\nand a peak rise magnitude of Mz = -18.9 mag. SN Ibn spectroscopic properties\nare commonly interpreted as the signature of a massive star (17 - 100 M_sun)\nexplosion within a He-enriched circumstellar medium. However, unlike previous\nType Ibn supernovae, PS1-12sk is associated with an elliptical brightest\ncluster galaxy, CGCG 208-042 (z = 0.054) in cluster RXC J0844.9+4258. The\nexpected probability of an event like PS1-12sk in such environments is low\ngiven the measured infrequency of core-collapse SNe in red sequence galaxies\ncompounded by the low volumetric rate of SN Ibn. Furthermore, we find no\nevidence of star formation at the explosion site to sensitive limits (Sigma\nHalpha < 2x10^-3 M_sun/yr/kpc^2). We therefore discuss white dwarf binary\nsystems as a possible progenitor channel for SNe Ibn. We conclude that PS1-12sk\nrepresents either a fortuitous and statistically unlikely discovery, evidence\nfor a top-heavy IMF in galaxy cluster cooling flow filaments, or the first clue\nsuggesting an alternate progenitor channel for Type Ibn SNe.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures, v2 as accepted by ApJ, more information at\n  http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~nsanders/papers/12sk/summary.htm"]}]

Smart phone based urban sensing can be\nleveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to- date\nnoise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and\nperformance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system\ncalled Ear-Phone. Ear-Phone investigates the use of different interpolation and\nregularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the\nnoise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data\ncollection. Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One\nmobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise\npollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones\nas sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary\ndepending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the\nuser is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her palm). To address this\nproblem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to\naccurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery,\nEar-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-phone also\nimplements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be\ncarried out without any technical skills whatsoever required on the user's\npart.

We prove that, when the population has the finite 4-th\nmoment and the dimension $m$ and the sample size $n$ satisfy $\\log\nm=o(n^{1/3})$, B-H method controls the false discovery rate (FDR) at a given\nlevel $\\alpha$ asymptotically with p-values estimated from N(0,1) or $t_{n-1}$\ndistribution. However, a phase transition phenomenon occurs when $\\log m\\geq\nc_{0}n^{1/3}$. In this case, the FDR of B-H method may be larger than $\\alpha$\nor even tends to one. In contrast, the bootstrap calibration is accurate for\n$\\log m=o(n^{1/2})$ as long as the underlying distribution has the sub-Gaussian\ntails. However, such light tailed condition can not be weakened in general. The\nsimulation study shows that for the heavy tailed distributions, the bootstrap\ncalibration is very conservative. In order to solve this problem, a regularized\nbootstrap correction is proposed and is shown to be robust to the tails of the\ndistributions. The simulation study shows that the regularized bootstrap method\nperforms better than the usual bootstrap method.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

Despite there being much\nrecent interest within the machine learning community about copula\nrepresentations, there has been scarce research into the CDN, its amalgamation\nwith copula theory, and no evaluation of its performance. Algorithms for\ninference, sampling, and learning in these models are underdeveloped compared\nthose of other PGMs, hindering widerspread use.\n  One advantage of the CDN is that it allows the factors to be parameterized as\ncopulae, combining the benefits of graphical models with those of copula\ntheory. In brief, the use of a copula parameterization enables greater\nmodelling flexibility by separating representation of the marginals from the\ndependence structure, permitting more efficient and robust learning.
