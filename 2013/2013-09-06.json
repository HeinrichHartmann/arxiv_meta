Determining that subset amounts to solving a number of\nreachability questions on a polynomial-size directed graph (which input gates\nare connected to the output gate?), taken from a very sparse set of graphs.\nHowever, it is not obvious whether or not this (restricted) reachability\nproblem can be solved, by say, uniform AC^0 circuits (constant depth,\npolynomial-size, AND, OR, NOT gates).

For the simple models such as vertically isothermal disks as well as\nadiabatic ones the exact solutions to the steady-state MHD\n(magneto-hydrodynamic) system were found under the assumption that the radial\ncomponents of velocity and magnetic field are negligible. On the basis of the\nexact solution one may conclude that vertically isothermal disks will be\ntotally isothermal. The exact solution for the case of adiabatic disk\ncorroborates the view that thin disk accretion must be highly non-adiabatic. An\nintermediate approach, that is between the above-listed two, for the modeling\nof thin accretion disks is developed. In the case of non-magnetic disk, this\napproach enables to prove, with ease, that all solutions for the mid-plane\ncircular velocity are unstable provided the disk is non-viscous. Hence, this\napproach enables to demonstrate that the pure hydrodynamic turbulence in\naccretion disks is possible. It is interesting that a turbulent magnetic disk\ntends to be Keplerian. This can easily be shown by assuming that the turbulent\ngas tends to flow with minimal losses, i.e. to have the Euler number as small\nas possible.\n","Comment: All found misprints are corrected.

The UV light curves folded on\nthe spin period show a double-humped modulation consistent with two-pole\naccretion. The optical photometry two years after outburst shows a group of\nfrequencies present at shorter periods (250-263 s) than the periods ascribed to\npulsation at quiescence, and these gradually shift toward the quiescent\nfrequencies (300-360 s) as time progresses past outburst. The most surprising\nresult is that the frequencies near this period in the UV data are only\nprominent in the emission lines, not the UV continuum, implying an origin away\nfrom the white dwarf photosphere. Thus, the connection of this group of periods\nwith non-radial pulsations of the white dwarf remains elusive.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 14 figs; accepted for ApJ"]}]

The signal of the positive superhump was only\ntransiently seen during the superoutburst, and it quickly decayed after the\nsuperoutburst. The frequency variation of the negative superhump was similar to\nthe two previously studied dwarf novae in the Kepler field, V1504 Cyg and V344\nLyr.

The\nproblem needs to be approached first with a diagonalized form (the spectral\nrepresentation) to deal with degeneracy. Such a form is useful for this\nparametrization in that the conditions to be a density matrix from a Hermitian\nmatrix are applied only to a diagonal eigenvalue matrix, not a unitary matrix.\nThose conditions can be satisfied by parametrizing eigenvalues with squared\nspherical coordinates in dimension of the matrix. Degeneracy in eigenvalues\nbrings symmetries between a eigenvalue matrix and a unitary matrix, which are\nrealized in a form of a commuting unitary matrix, called a commutant. The\nassociated redundant parameters in a unitary matrix have to be eliminated. It\nis realized in this paper that degrees of degeneracies can be defined as the\ntotal number of possible pairs of the same eigenvalues and one degree of\ndegeneracy corresponds to one phase and one two dimensional rotation in a\nunitary matrix or a commutant. In this way all the degeneracies are identified\nand assigned to one phase-one rotation block. Therefore, a unitary matrix or a\ncommutant is a product of these blocks and a general diagonal phase matrix. In\nphysics a unitary matrix is often parametrized by rotation and phase matrices,\ncalled an angular representation here. There are many possible different phase\nconfigurations. It is often not a trivial matter whether a given parametrized\nunitary matrix is general.

The new method is based on a\ncomparison of the estimated spectral distribution on different segments of the\nobserved time series and consists of three steps: it starts with a consistent\ntest, which allows to prove the existence of structural breaks at a controlled\ntype I error.

Evidence comes\nfrom the accessibility to external methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents of the\npositively charged arginine residues (R) on this segment. These are first\nmutated to cysteines (C), which in turn react with MTS reagents; it is assumed\nthat the C is passively carried in the S4 movement, becoming accessible on one\nside or the other of the membrane. However, the Rs were salt bridged to\nnegatively charged residues on other transmembrane segments, or hydrogen\nbonded, while C reacts as a negative ion. The space available for MTS is fairly\nclose to the difference in volume between the large R residue and much smaller\nC, so the MTS is not severely sterically hindered. A reagent molecule can reach\na C side chain; the C can react if not repelled by a negative charge from the\namino acid to which the R had been salt bridged. Nearby protons may also make\nreaction possible unless the C itself is protonated. Therefore interpretation\nof the C substitution results requires reconsideration. To test the idea we\nhave done quantum calculations on part of a mutated S4 and the nearby section\nof the channel. The mutation is R300C of the 2A79/3Lut structure, a mutation\nthat would be done to test MTS reagent access; there is a large cavity where\nthe R is replaced by C. Two quantum calculations show a substantial difference\nin the structure of this cavity with 2 water molecules compared to 4.

The objective is to\nminimize the total tardiness by determining the allocation and sequence of jobs\non identical parallel machines. In this problem, the processing time of each\njob is a step function dependent upon its starting time. An individual extended\ntime is penalized when the starting time of a job is later than a specific\ndeterioration date. The possibility of deterioration of a job makes the\nparallel machine scheduling problem more challenging than ordinary ones. A\nmixed integer programming model for the optimal solution is derived. Due to its\nNP-hard nature, a hybrid discrete cuckoo search algorithm is proposed to solve\nthis problem. In order to generate a good initial swarm, a modified heuristic\nnamed the MBHG is incorporated into the initialization of population. Several\ndiscrete operators are proposed in the random walk of L\\'{e}vy Flights and the\ncrossover search. Moreover, a local search procedure based on variable\nneighborhood descent is integrated into the algorithm as a hybrid strategy in\norder to improve the quality of elite solutions. Computational experiments are\nexecuted on two sets of randomly generated test instances. The results show\nthat the proposed hybrid algorithm can yield better solutions in comparison\nwith the commercial solver CPLEX with one hour time limit, discrete cuckoo\nsearch algorithm and the existing variable neighborhood search algorithm.\n"]}]

Very high carrier mobility in a\ngraphene-on-boron nitride assembly is now well-established, but it has been\nanticipated that appropriately designed hybrids could perform other tasks as\nwell. A heterostructure of graphene and molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) is\nexpected to be sensitive to photo illumination due to the optical bandgap in\nMoS$_2$. Despite significant advances in device architectures with both\ngraphene and MoS$_2$, binary graphene-MoS$_2$ hybrids have not been realized so\nfar, and the promising opto-electronic properties of such structures remain\nelusive. Here we demonstrate experimentally that graphene-on-MoS$_2$ binary\nheterostructures display an unexpected and remarkable persistent\nphotoconductivity under illumination of white light. The photoconductivity can\nnot only be tuned independently with both light intensity and back gate\nvoltage, but in response to a suitable combination of light and gate voltage\npulses the device functions as a re-writable optoelectronic switch or memory.\nThe persistent, or `ON', state shows virtually no relaxation or decay within\nthe the experimental time scales for low and moderate photoexcitation\nintensity, indicating a near-perfect charge retention. A microscopic model\nassociates the persistence with strong localization of carriers in MoS$_2$.\nThese effects are also observable at room temperature, and with chemical vapour\ndeposited graphene, and hence are naturally scalable for large area\napplications.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Furthermore, we provide an\ninterpretation of the timing variation.
