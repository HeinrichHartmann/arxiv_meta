Simple models of irreversible dynamics on graphs, in which\nnodes activate depending on the state of their neighbors, have been\nsuccessfully applied to describe cascades in a large variety of contexts. Over\nthe last decades, many efforts have been devoted to understand the typical\nbehaviour of the cascades arising from initial conditions extracted at random\nfrom some given ensemble. However, the problem of optimizing the trajectory of\nthe system, i.e. of identifying appropriate initial conditions to maximize (or\nminimize) the final number of active nodes, is still considered to be\npractically intractable, with the only exception of models that satisfy a sort\nof diminishing returns property called submodularity. Submodular models can be\napproximately solved by means of greedy strategies, but by definition they lack\ncooperative characteristics which are fundamental in many real systems. Here we\nintroduce an efficient algorithm based on statistical physics for the\noptimization of trajectories in cascade processes on graphs. We show that for a\nwide class of irreversible dynamics, even in the absence of submodularity, the\nspread optimization problem can be solved efficiently on large networks.\nAnalytic and algorithmic results on random graphs are complemented by the\nsolution of the spread maximization problem on a real-world network (the\nEpinions consumer reviews network).\n","Comment: Replacement for \"The Spread Optimization Problem\""]}]

On average, the escape fraction from a SFMC\nparticle rises from 0.27% at its birth to 2.1% at the end of a particle\nlifetime, 6 Myrs. This is because SFMC particles drift away from the dense gas\nclumps in which they were born, and because the gas around the star-forming\nclumps is dispersed by ionizing radiation and supernova feedback.

We applied the tool of\nthe LF statistics to three GRB classes predicted by the Fireshell model. One of\nthe main differences between the Fireshell and Fireball models is the\nexplanation of the GRB prompt emission, where the first claims that it is\ndivided in two physical processes: 1) transparency of a optically thick\nFreshell producing the P-GRB emission and 2) interaction of a relativistic\nshell (composed by baryons electron-positron-photon) against the CBM\n(circumburst medium), producing the emission so-called extended afterglow peak\n(EAP). However, the Fireball model, the most quoted one, claims that the prompt\nemission is caused by interactions among several relativistic shells (composed\nby electron-positron-photon) with different Lorentz factors, a process called\ninternal shocks. The transparency produces a strong short emission in the\nbeginning, called P-GRB. Thus, to the Fireshell model, the prompt emission is\nP-GRB plus EAP.

Number of possible energetically degenerate ground states strongly\ndepends on the overall length of the chain, or, in other terms, on average\nlength of the link between neighboring particles.

HF and CISD\nground state energy calculations were performed for systems with N and N-1\nelectrons to compute the ionization energies for nuclear charges ranging from\nthe neutral atom region to the anionic instability threshold. As testing\nsystems we choose inert gases (He-like, Ne-like and Ar-like isoelectronic\nsequences) and alkali metals (Li-like, Na-like, K-like sequences). From the\nresults, it is apparent that, for inert gases case, the stability relation with\nN is completely inverted in the singly-charged anion region (Z=N-1) with\nrespect to the neutral atom region (Z=N), i.e. larger systems are more stable\nthan the smaller ones. We devised a semi-analytical model (inspired by the\nzero-range forces theory) which lead us to establish the ionization energy\ndependence on the nuclear charge near the threshold. This dependence is well\nobserved in our numerical computations. Finally, we were able to describe\nqualitatively two universality classes for systems similar to inert gases and\nalkali metals, respectively.\n","Comment: 70 pages, 10 figures, BSc. thesis in Physics (defended on June 15th,\n  2011), written in Spanish"]}]

In its most abstract form, a mixed\nmembership model aims to associate an individual entity with some set of\nattributes based on a collection of observed data. Although much of the\nliterature on mixed membership models considers the setting in which\nexchangeable collections of data are associated with each member of a set of\nentities, it is equally natural to consider problems in which an entire time\nseries is viewed as an entity and the goal is to characterize the time series\nin terms of a set of underlying dynamic attributes or \"dynamic regimes\".\nIndeed, this perspective is already present in the classical hidden Markov\nmodel, where the dynamic regimes are referred to as \"states\", and the\ncollection of states realized in a sample path of the underlying process can be\nviewed as a mixed membership characterization of the observed time series. Our\ngoal here is to review some of the richer modeling possibilities for time\nseries that are provided by recent developments in the mixed membership\nframework.\n"]}]
