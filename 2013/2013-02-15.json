On all networks we find\nthat the out-degree is a good predictor of the lethality of a single node\nknock-out. For knock-outs of node pairs, the fraction of successors shared\nbetween the two knocked-out nodes (out-overlap) is a good predictor of\nsynthetic lethality.

First we study Lieb-Robinson bounds in a quantum\nlattice systems. The time-dependent generator of the dynamics of the system is\nof the Lindblad-Kossakowski type. This generator satisfies some suitable decay\ncondition in space. We show that the dynamics with a such generator on a finite\nsystem is a well-defined quantum dynamics in a sense of a norm-continuous\ncocycle of unit preserving completely positive maps. After proving\nLieb-Robinson bounds for a finite lattice systems we also show the existence of\nthe thermodynamic limit of the dynamics. We show that in a strong limit there\nexits a strongly continuous cocycle of unit preserving completely positive\nmaps. Which means that the dynamics exists in an infinite system, where\nLieb-Robinson bounds also holds.\n  In the second part of the paper we consider a system that consists of a beam\nof two-level atoms that pass one by one through the microwave cavity. The atoms\nare randomly excited and there is exactly one atom present in the cavity at any\ngiven moment. We consider both the ideal and leaky cavity and study the time\nasymptotic behavior of the state of the cavity. We show that the number of\nphotons increases indefinitely in the case of the ideal cavity. In case of\nleaky cavity we prove that the mean photon number in the cavity stabilizes in\ntime. The limiting state of the cavity in this case exists and it is\nindependent of the initial state. We calculate the characteristic functional of\nthis non-quasi-free non-equilibrium state. We also calculate the energy flux in\nboth the ideal and leaky and the entropy production for the ideal cavity.\n","Comment: This is a corrected version of my UC Davis PhD dissertation. 97 pages"]}]

For\nthe realized volatility, we use recently proposed methods which are robust to\nnoise as well as jumps and interestingly we find that it does not affect the\nimplied-realized volatility relation. In addition, we develop a new tool for\nthe estimation of fractional cointegrating relation between implied and\nrealized volatility based on wavelets, a wavelet band least squares (WBLS). The\nmain advantage of WBLS in comparison to other frequency domain methods is that\nit allows us to work conveniently with potentially non-stationary volatility\ndue to the properties of wavelets. We study the dynamics of the relationship in\nthe time-frequency domain with the wavelet coherence confirming that the\ndependence comes solely from the lower frequencies of the spectra. Motivated by\nthis result we estimate the relationship only on this part of the spectra using\nWBLS and compare our results to the fully modified narrow-band least squares\n(FMNBLS) based on the Fourier frequencies.

Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular\napproach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. Standard\ninterior-point SDP solvers typically have a complexity of $O(D^{6.5})$ (with\n$D$ the dimension of input data), and can thus only practically solve problems\nexhibiting less than a few thousand variables. Since the number of variables is\n$D (D+1) / 2 $, this implies a limit upon the size of problem that can\npractically be solved of around a few hundred dimensions. The complexity of the\npopular quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning approach thus limits the size of\nproblem to which metric learning can be applied. Here we propose a\nsignificantly more efficient approach to the metric learning problem based on\nthe Lagrange dual formulation of the problem. The proposed formulation is much\nsimpler to implement, and therefore allows much larger Mahalanobis metric\nlearning problems to be solved. The time complexity of the proposed method is\n$O (D ^ 3) $, which is significantly lower than that of the SDP approach.\nExperiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art, but is applicable to\nsignificantly larger problems. We also show that the proposed method can be\napplied to solve more general Frobenius-norm regularized SDP problems\napproximately.\n"]}]

After a description of the\nproperties and cosmological aims of Planck, we review the results obtained\nduring the first 1.6 full sky surveys relative to compact extragalactic sources\nand their implications. The most recent and efficient methods and filters for\ncompact source detection in the presence of Gaussian noise and CMB anisotropies\nare discussed. The first surveys of Planck have enabled the detection of about\n200 galaxy clusters, by the SZ effect, and from several hundreds to many\nthousands of extragalactic point sources (EPS), presented in the Planck ERCSC.\nWe review the results on the SZ effect in galaxy clusters. We discuss the\npossibilities of future Planck data to study clusters through the SZ effect and\nthe interesting possibilities of combining these data with X ray observations.\nThese EPS can be classified into two main source classes: radio sources, at\nintermediate to high z; far IR sources, typically at very z. Planck number\ncounts of EPS at LFI frequencies are in agreement with WMAP counts. A clear\nsteepening of the mean spectral index of bright radio sources is observed above\n70 GHz, that can be interpreted in terms of a break frequency in their spectra.\nFor nearby dusty galaxies, Planck observations find evidence of colder dust,\nwith T < 20 K, than has previously been found. More recently, the number counts\nof bright local dusty galaxies and of synchrotron sources have been measured by\nPlanck at submm wavelengths.

It is therefore tunable to optimize the\npower while keeping a much larger level spacing for the individual quantum\ndots. Despite the simplicity of the physical model, the optimized rectified\ncurrent and power is larger than any other candidate nano-engine. The ability\nto scale the power by putting many such engines into a two-dimensional layered\nstructure gives a paradigmatic system for harvesting thermal energy at the\nnanoscale.

The condition U=\\infty is implemented within the\nslave-boson formalism considering the slave bosons to be condensed. We consider\nthe $f$-level occupancy ranging from the mixed valence regime to the Kondo\nlimit and study the dependence of the critical temperature on the various model\nparameters for each of three possible Cooper pairing symmetries (extended s,\nd-wave and p-wave pairing) and find interesting crossovers. It is found that\nthe d- and p- wave order parameters have, in general, very similar critical\ntemperatures. The extended s-wave pairing seems to be relatively more stable\nfor electronic densities per channel close to one and for large values of the\nsuperconducting interaction J.\n","Comment: Seven Figures; one appendix.
