Being essentially constant over a few Volts, the\nslope of atomistic force versus bias is the basic quantity which determines\nvariations of the atomic-scale LCPD contrast. Already above A = 0.1 nm, the\nLCPD contrasts in both modes exhibit almost the same spatial dependence as the\nslope. In the AM mode, this contrast is approximately proportional to\n$A^{-1/2}$, but remains much weaker than the contrast in the FM mode, which\ndrops somewhat faster as A is increased. These trends are a consequence of the\nmacroscopic contributions to the KPFM signal, which are stronger in the AM-mode\nand especially important if the sample is an insulator even at sub-nanometer\nseparations where atomic-scale contrast appears.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures"]}]

However, one question remains: Does glycerol modulate water\npermeation? This study answers this fundamental question by determining the\nchemical-potential profile of glycerol along the permeation path through GlpF's\nconducting pore. There is a deep well near the Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs\n(dissociation constant 14 microM) and a barrier near the selectivity filter\n(10.1 kcal/mol above the well bottom). This profile owes its existence to\nGlpF's perfect steric arrangement: The glycerol-protein van der Waals\ninteractions are attractive near the NPA but repulsive elsewhere in the\nconducting pore. In light of the single-file nature of waters and glycerols\nlining up in GlpF's amphipathic pore, it leads to the following conclusion:\nGlycerol modulates water permeation in the microM range. At mM concentrations,\nGlpF is glycerol-saturated and a glycerol dwelling in the well occludes the\nconducting pore. Therefore, water permeation is fully correlated to glycerol\ndissociation that has an Arrhenius activation barrier of 6.5 kcal/mol.\nValidation of this theory is based on the existent in vitro data, some of which\nhave not been given the proper attention they deserved: The Arrhenius\nactivation barriers were found to be 7 kcal/mol for water permeation and 9.6\nkcal/mol for glycerol permeation; The presence of up to 100 mM glycerol did not\naffect the kinetics of water transport with very low permeability, in apparent\ncontradiction with the existent theories that predicted high permeability (0 M\nglycerol).\n"]}]

Particular attention is paid to the separation\nof the momentum distributions into the mean-field and short-range correlations\n(SRC) contributions. It is shown that at high values of the momentum $k$ the\nhigh-momentum components ($k\\gtrsim 1.5-2$ fm$^{-1}$) of all nuclei considered\nare very similar, exhibiting the well-known scaling behavior with the mass\nnumber $A$, independently of the used many-body approach and the details of the\nbare $NN$ interaction. The number of $NN$ pairs in a given ($ST$) state, viz.,\n($ST$)=(10), (00), (01), and (11), and the contribution of these states to the\nnucleon momentum distributions are calculated. It is shown that, apart from the\n(00) state, which has very small effects, all other spin-isospin states\ncontribute to the momentum distribution in a wide range of momenta. It is shown\nthat that for all nuclei considered the momentum distributions in the states\nT=0 and T=1 exhibit at $k\\gtrsim 1.5-2$ fm$^{-1}$ very similar behaviors, which\nrepresents strong evidence of the A-independent character of SRCs. The ratio\n$n_A(k)/n_D(k)$ is analyzed in detail stressing that in the SRC region it\nalways increases with the momentum and the origin of such an increase is\ndiscussed and elucidated. The relationships between the one- and two-body\nmomentum distributions, considered in a previous paper, are discussed and\nclarified, pointing out the relevant role played by the center-of-mass motion\nof a correlated pair in the (10) state.

Both continuous and discontinuous phase\ntransitions as well as tricritical points characterize the complex evolutionary\ndynamics, which is due to multipoint interactions that are introduced by\nconditional punishment.

The\nphylum Nematoda is divided into the Chromadorea (indcludes C. elegans) and the\nEnoplea. Compared to C. elegans, enoplean nematodes have very different\npatterns of cell division and determination. Embryogenesis of the enoplean\nRomanomermis culicivorax has been studied in great detail, but the genetic\ncircuitry underpinning development in this species is unknown. Results We\ncreated a draft genome of R. culicivorax and compared its developmental gene\ncontent with that of two nematodes, C. elegans and Trichinella spiralis\n(another enoplean), and a representative arthropod Tribolium castaneum. This\ngenome evidence shows that R. culicivorax retains components of the conserved\nmetazoan developmental toolkit lost in C. elegans. T. spiralis has\nindependently lost even more of the toolkit than has C. elegans. However, the\nC. elegans toolkit is not simply depauperate, as many genes essential for\nembryogenesis in C. elegans are unique to this lineage, or have only extremely\ndivergent homologues in R. culicivorax and T. spiralis. These data imply\nfundamental differences in the genetic programmes for early cell specification,\ninductive interactions, vulva formation and sex determination. Conclusions Thus\nnematodes, despite their apparent phylum-wide morphological conservatism, have\nevolved major differences in the molecular logic of their development. R.\nculicivorax serves as a tractable, contrasting model to C. elegans for\nunderstanding how divergent genomic and thus regulatory backgrounds can\ngenerate a conserved phenotype.

A value of\nzero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one\nindicates that the documents are practically identical. Traditionally,\nvector-based models have been used for computing the document similarity. The\nvector-based models represent several features present in documents.

The competing ISPs are assumed to have knowledge\non only the statistical distribution of these functions. We derive in this\npaper models for studying the impact that the CP can have on the utilities of\nthe ISPs by favoring one of them by exclusively revealing its private\ninformation. We also consider the case where CP can charge ISPs for providing\nsuch information. We propose two mechanisms based on {\\em weighted proportional\nfairness} for payment between ISPs and CP. Finally, we compare the social\nutility resulting from these mechanisms with the optimal social utility by\nintroducing a performance metric termed as {\\em price of partial bargaining}\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, Accepted at WiOpt 2013"]}]

We model the\npopulation by a measure space where the measure determines the abundance of\nindividual preferences. The preferences of an individual are described by a\nmeasurable choice of a rough path. We focus on the case of weakly interacting\nsystems, where we are able to exhibit the existence and uniqueness of\nconsistent solutions. In general, solutions are continuum of interacting\nthreads analogous to the huge number of individual atomic trajectories that\ntogether make up the motion of a fluid. The evolution of the population need\nnot be governed by any over-arching PDE. Although one can match the standard\nnonlinear parabolic PDEs of McKean-Vlasov type with specific examples of\ncommunities in this case. The bulk behaviour of the evolving population\nprovides a solution to the PDE. An important technical result is continuity of\nthe behaviour of the system with respect to changes in the measure assigning\nweight to individuals. Replacing the deterministic measure with the empirical\ndistribution of an i.i.d. sample from it leads to many standard models, and\napplying the continuity result allows easy proofs for propagation of chaos. The\nrigorous underpinning presented here leads to uncomplicated models which have\nwide applicability in both the physical and social sciences. We make no\npresumption that the macroscopic dynamics are modelled by a PDE. This work\nbuilds on the fine probability literature considering the limit behaviour for\nsystems where a large no of particles are interacting with independent\npreferences; there is also work on continuum models with preferences described\nby a semi-martingale measure.
