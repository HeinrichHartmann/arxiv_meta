Given\nthe utility of these tools, we often forget that their model - for\nmathematical, and not biological reasons - makes assumptions that are violated\nin most real-world populations.

Under the assumption that this limiting system admits a\ncodimension one submanifold of attractive fixed points -- a condition that\nnaturally generalises the weak selection regime of classical population\ndynamics -- it is shown that for an appropriate rescaling of time, the finite\ndimensional distributions of the original process converge to those of a\ndiffusion process on the submanifold.

We found\nthat when considering even two linearly interacting radial modes for the HP\nflow, linear instability is possible only when there exists mentioned above\nconditionally periodic longitudinal along the pipe axis disturbance variability\nwhen Re_th(p) very sensitively depends on the ratio p of two longitudinal\nperiods each of which describes longitudinal variability for its own radial\nmode only.

The main area of the applications is the geometric tomography\nbecause $f_K$ involves the coordinate X-rays' information as second order\npartial derivatives \\cite{NV3}.

The upper\nsemi-continuity establishes an approximating process in the sense that if $f_L$\nis close to $f_K$ then $L$ must be close to an element $K'$ such that\n$f_{K}=f_{K'}$. Therefore $K$ and $K'$ have the same coordinate X-rays almost\neverywhere. Lower semi-continuity is usually related to the existence of\ncontinuous selections.

The topics are\nseparated into two parts. The first part describes the determination of\nconstants needed to interpret the digitized output of our electronics so that\nwe can obtain physical numbers such as photon counts and their arrival times\nfor each photomultiplier tube (PMT). In this context, we developed an in-situ\nprocedure to determine high-voltage settings for PMTs in large detectors like\nSK, as well as a new method for measuring PMT quantum efficiency and gain in\nsuch a detector. The second part describes the modeling of the detector in our\nMonte Carlo simulation, including in particular the optical properties of its\nwater target and their variability over time. Detailed studies on the water\nquality are also presented. As a result of this work, we achieved a precision\nsufficient for physics analysis over a wide energy range (from a few MeV to\nabove a TeV). For example, the charge determination was understood at the 1%\nlevel, and the timing resolution was 2.1 nsec at the one-photoelectron charge\nlevel and 0.5 nsec at the 100-photoelectron charge level.\n","Comment: 75 pages, 35 figures"]}]

The algorithm samples from a stretched\nBoltzmann distribution \\begin{align*}\\pi(w) &= (|w|+1)^{\\alpha} \\beta^{|w|}\n\\cdot Z^{-1} \\end{align*} where $|w|$ is the length of a word $w$, $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ are parameters of the algorithm, and $Z$ is a normalising constant. It\nfollows that words of the same length are sampled with the same probability.\nThe distribution can be expressed in terms of the cogrowth series of the group,\nwhich then allows us to relate statistical properties of words sampled by the\nalgorithm to the cogrowth of the group, and hence its amenability.\n  We have implemented the algorithm and applied it to several group\npresentations including the Baumslag-Solitar groups, some free products studied\nby Kouksov, a finitely presented amenable group that is not subexponentially\namenable (based on the basilica group), and Richard Thompson's group $F$.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 9 figures.

The first part contains the study of\nsome properties of the electromagnetic duality in 4 dimensions. An extended\ndouble potential formalism for linearized gravity is introduced which allows to\nwrite an action manifestly invariant under duality rotations in presence of\nboth electric and magnetic external sources. It is also shown how, in the\nreduced phase-space, all higher spin gauge fields can be written as\nbi-hamiltonian systems. The role of the second hamiltonian is played by the\nelectromagnetic duality generator. The second part is devoted to the study of\nasymptotic symmetries and their applications to holography. After a review of\nsymmetries and classical solutions involved in the AdS3/CFT2 correspondence, we\napply a similar analysis to asymptotically flat spacetimes at null infinity in\n3 and 4 dimensions. In particular, it is argued that the symmetry algebra of\nasymptotically flat spacetimes at null infinity in 4 dimensions should be taken\nas the semi-direct sum of supertranslations with infinitesimal local conformal\ntransformations and not, as usually done, with the Lorentz algebra. The first\napplications are studied: an exact representation by bulk vector fields of the\nasymptotic symmetry algebra through the introduction of a modified Lie bracket,\nthe derivation of how this symmetry algebra is realized on solution space and\nthe construction of the associated centrally extended surface charge algebra.\n","Comment: PhD Thesis"]}]
