We present, in this paper, a genetic algorithm\nfor multi-objective optimization of a dynamic multi pickup and delivery problem\nwith time windows (Dynamic m-PDPTW). We propose a brief literature review of\nthe PDPTW, present our approach based on Pareto dominance method and lower\nbounds, to give a satisfying solution to the Dynamic m-PDPTW minimizing the\ncompromise between total travel cost and total tardiness time. Computational\nresults indicate that the proposed algorithm gives good results with a total\ntardiness equal to zero with a tolerable cost.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1101.3396"]}]
