In the QHE regime,\nat high magnetic field and low temperature ($T<1.3 \\textrm{K}$), the Hall\nresistance is measured by comparison with a GaAs based quantum resistance\nstandard using a cryogenic current comparator. In the low dissipation limit, it\nis found quantized within 5 parts in $10^{7}$ (one standard deviation, $1\n\\sigma$) at the expected rational fractions of the von Klitzing constant,\nrespectively $R_{\\mathrm{K}}/2$ and $R_{\\mathrm{K}}/4$ in the ML and BL\ndevices. These results constitute the most accurate QHE quantization tests to\ndate in monolayer and bilayer exfoliated graphene. It turns out that a main\nlimitation to the quantization accuracy, which is found well above the\n$10^{-9}$ accuracy usually achieved in GaAs, is the low value of the QHE\nbreakdown current being no more than $1 \\mu\\mathrm{A}$. The current dependence\nof the longitudinal conductivity investigated in the BL Hall bar shows that\ndissipation occurs through quasi-elastic inter-Landau level scattering,\nassisted by large local electric fields. We propose that charged impurities are\nresponsible for an enhancement of such inter-Landau level transition rate and\ncause small breakdown currents.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures"]}]

This question was first asked almost 20 years ago by Dyer\nand Frieze [9] where they showed that a natural randomized strategy of picking\nedges uniformly at random doesn't help and has an approximation factor of 1/2 +\no(1). They left it as an open question to devise a better randomized greedy\nalgorithm. In subsequent work, Aronson, Dyer, Frieze, and Suen [2] gave a\ndifferent randomized greedy algorithm and showed that it attains a factor 0.5 +\nepsilon where epsilon is 0.0000025.\n  In this paper we propose and analyze a new randomized greedy algorithm for\nfinding a large matching in a general graph and use it to solve the query\ncommit problem mentioned above. We show that our algorithm attains a factor of\nat least 0.56, a significant improvement over 0.50000025. We also show that no\nrandomized algorithm can have an approximation factor better than 0.7916 for\nthe query commit problem. For another large and interesting class of randomized\nalgorithms that we call vertex-iterative algorithms, we show that no\nvertex-iterative algorithm can have an approximation factor better than 0.75.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors. The result claiming a\n  factor 0.56 algorithm is invalid because of a crucial bug in Claim 2 which\n  was brought to our attention by Matthias Poloczek, Frans Schalekamp, and Anke\n  van Zuylen"]}]

Cognitive users first\ndetermine the activity of the primary users' through channel sensing and then\ninitiate data transmission at a power level that depends on the channel sensing\ndecisions. It is assumed that finite blocklength codes are employed in the data\ntransmission phase. Hence, errors can occur in reception and retransmissions\ncan be required. Primary users' activities are modeled as a two-state Markov\nchain and an eight-state Markov chain is constructed in order to model the\ncognitive radio channel. Channel state information (CSI) is assumed to be\nperfectly known by either the secondary receiver only or both the secondary\ntransmitter and receiver. In the absence of CSI at the transmitter, fixed-rate\ntransmission is performed whereas under perfect CSI knowledge, for a given\ntarget error probability, the transmitter varies the rate according to the\nchannel conditions. Under these assumptions, throughput in the presence of\nbuffer constraints is determined by characterizing the maximum constant arrival\nrates that can be supported by the cognitive radio channel while satisfying\ncertain limits on buffer violation probabilities. Tradeoffs between throughput,\nbuffer constraints, coding blocklength, and sensing duration for both\nfixed-rate and variable-rate transmissions are analyzed numerically.

The theory introduces a valley\ncoupling parameter, $v_v$, which encapsulates the physics of the quantum well\ninterface. The new effective mass parameter is computed by means of a tight\nbinding theory. The resulting formalism provides rather simple analytical\nresults for several geometries of interest, including a finite square well, a\nquantum well in an electric field, and a modulation doped two-dimensional\nelectron gas. Of particular importance is the problem of a quantum well in a\nmagnetic field, grown on a miscut substrate. The latter may pose a numerical\nchallenge for atomistic techniques like tight-binding, because of its\ntwo-dimensional nature. In the effective mass theory, however, the results are\nstraightforward and analytical. We compare our effective mass results with\nthose of the tight binding theory, obtaining excellent agreement.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures. Version submitted to PRB"]}]

Moreover, there is no strict distinction between alive and dead;\none can only infer that a protocell was alive if it replicates. These features\nof early life render natural selection inapplicable to the description of its\nchange-of-state because they defy its underlying assumptions. Moreover, natural\nselection describes only randomly generated novelty; it cannot describe the\nemergence of form at the interface between organism and environment.\nSelf-organization is also inadequate because it is restricted to interactions\namongst parts; it too cannot account for context-driven change. A modified\nversion of selection theory or self-organization would not work because the\ndescription of change-of-state through interaction with an incompletely\nspecified context has a completely different mathematical structure, i.e.\nentails a non-Kolmogorovian probability model. It is proposed that the\nevolution of early life is appropriately described as lineage transformation\nthrough context-driven actualization of potential (CAP), with self-organized\nchange-of-state being a special case of no contextual influence, and\ncompetitive exclusion of less fit individuals through a selection-like process\npossibly (but not necessarily) playing a secondary role.
