Linear Elastic (LE) analysis are performed in Abaqus (v-6.11) order to\nidentify the optimized geometry of DTR dowels that would achieve (1) highest\nload transfer across adjacent slabs through shear action, and (2) lowest\nbearing stresses on the concrete.

The Riks method available in Abaqus/Standard, coupled with the\nConcrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model is used to simulate the degradation of\nconcrete surrounding both DTR the traditional cylindrical dowels. Results\nobtained show that the use of DTR dowels can reduce bearing stresses at the\nface of the joint by as much 2.2 times as compared to traditional cylindrical\ndowels. While adequate load-transfer is a crucial part for the proper\nperformance pavement structures, the load-transfer capacity of DTR dowels was\nmore effective over cylindrical dowels by as far as 116%. In the inelastic\nrange, even after significant concrete degradation and steel yielding, DTR\ndowels maintained a higher load-transfer capacity than traditional cylindrical\ndowels, and also presented lower amounts of differential deflections across\nconcrete floors. Finally, damage in the concrete matrix below the dowel was\nrelatively more confined for the case of DTR dowels, as compared to traditional\ncylindrical dowels.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 8 figures"]}]

We study a general class of\n\"tripartite\" composite fermion wave functions, which reduce to the Read-Rezayi\nground state and quasiholes for appropriate quantum numbers, but also allow a\nconstruction of wave functions for quasiparticles and neutral excitations by\nanalogy to the standard composite fermion theory. We present numerical evidence\nin finite systems that these trial wave functions capture well the low energy\nphysics of a 4-body model interaction. We also compare the tripartite composite\nfermion wave functions with the exact Coulomb eigenstates at\n$2+\\nicefrac{3}{5}$, and find reasonably good agreement. The ground state as\nwell as several excited states of the 4-body interaction are seen to evolve\nadiabatically into the corresponding Coulomb states for N=15 particles. These\nresults support the plausibility of the Read-Rezayi proposal for the\n$2+\\nicefrac{2}{5}$ and $2+\\nicefrac{3}{5}$ fractional quantum Hall effect.\nHowever, certain other proposals also remain viable, and further study of\nexcitations and edge states will be necessary for a decisive establishment of\nthe physical mechanism of these fractional quantum Hall states.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 14 figures"]}]

As an approximation strategy, we\noptimize the solution space over `classical' product states, which in turn\nintroduces a novel autonomous classical optimization problem, PSAT, over a\nspace of continuous degrees of freedom rather than discrete bits. Our central\nresults are: (i) The derivation of a set of bounds and approximations in\nvarious limits of the problem, several of which we believe may be amenable to a\nrigorous treatment. (ii) A demonstration that an approximation based on a\ngreedy algorithm borrowed from the study of frustrated magnetism performs well\nover a wide range in parameter space, and its performance reflects structure of\nthe solution space of random $k$-QSAT. Simulated annealing exhibits\nmetastability in similar `hard' regions of parameter space. (iii) A\ngeneralization of belief propagation algorithms introduced for classical\nproblems to the case of continuous spins. This yields both approximate\nsolutions, as well as insights into the free energy `landscape' of the\napproximation problem, including a so-called dynamical transition near the\nsatisfiability threshold. Taken together, these results allow us to elucidate\nthe phase diagram of random $k$-QSAT in a two-dimensional\nenergy-density--clause-density space.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures"]}]

The resulting nuclear transmutations are particularly strong for the\ncase of magnetite rocks, i.e. loadstones. We argue that the fission of the iron\nnucleus is a consequence of photo-disintegration. The electro-strong coupling\nbetween electromagnetic fields and nuclear giant dipole resonances are central\nfor producing observed nuclear reactions. The large electron energies produced\nduring the fracture of piezomagnetic rocks are closely analogous to the\npreviously discussed case of the fracture of piezoelectric rocks. In both cases\nelectro-weak interactions can produce neutrons and neutrinos from energetic\nprotons and electrons thus inducing nuclear transmutations.
