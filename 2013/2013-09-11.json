Here we\nconsider simple disease spreading processes on empirical time-varying networks\nof contacts between individuals, and compare the effect of several immunization\nstrategies on these processes. An immunization strategy is defined as the\nchoice of a set of nodes (individuals) who cannot catch nor transmit the\ndisease. This choice is performed according to a certain ranking of the nodes\nof the contact network. We consider various ranking strategies, focusing in\nparticular on the role of the training window during which the nodes'\nproperties are measured in the time-varying network: longer training windows\ncorrespond to a larger amount of information collected and could be expected to\nresult in better performances of the immunization strategies. We find instead\nan unexpected saturation in the efficiency of strategies based on nodes'\ncharacteristics when the length of the training window is increased, showing\nthat a limited amount of information on the contact patterns is sufficient to\ndesign efficient immunization strategies. This finding is balanced by the large\nvariations of the contact patterns, which strongly alter the importance of\nnodes from one period to the next and therefore significantly limit the\nefficiency of any strategy based on an importance ranking of nodes.

One\nadvantage is that they bridge two different scales: the microscopic and the\nmacroscopic one. Diffusion is a mathematical idealisation, however: it assumes\nvanishingly small state changes at the microscopic level. In real biological\nsystems this is often not the case. The differential Chapman-Kolmogorov\nequation is more appropriate to model population dynamics that is not well\ndescribed by drift and diffusion alone.\n  Here, the method of characteristics is used to transform deterministic\ndynamics away and find a coordinate frame where this equation reduces to a\nMaster equation. There is no longer a drift term, and solution methods there\nare insensitive to density gradients, making the method suitable for jump\nprocesses with arbitrary jump sizes. Moreover, its solution is universal: it no\nlonger depends explicitly on the deterministic system.\n  We demonstrate the technique on simple models of neuronal populations.\nSurprisingly, it is suitable for fast neural dynamics, even though in the new\ncoordinate frame state space may expand rapidly towards infinity. We\ndemonstrate universality: the method is applicable to any one dimensional\nneural model and show this on populations of leaky- and\nquadratic-integrate-and-fire neurons.

However, the PGAS rich\nmemory model comes at a performance cost which can hinder its potential for\nscalability and performance. To contain this overhead and achieve full\nperformance, compiler optimizations may not be sufficient and manual\noptimizations are typically added. This, however, can severely limit the\nproductivity advantage. Such optimizations are usually targeted at reducing\naddress translation overheads for shared data structures. This paper proposes a\nhardware architectural support for PGAS, which allows the processor to\nefficiently handle shared addresses. This eliminates the need for such\nhand-tuning, while maintaining the performance and productivity of PGAS\nlanguages. We propose to avail this hardware support to compilers by\nintroducing new instructions to efficiently access and traverse the PGAS memory\nspace. A prototype compiler is realized by extending the Berkeley Unified\nParallel C (UPC) compiler.

Two implementations are realized: the first is\nimplemented using the full system simulator Gem5, which allows the evaluation\nof the performance gain. The second is implemented using a softcore processor\nLeon3 on an FPGA to verify the implementability and to parameterize the cost of\nthe new hardware and its instructions. The new instructions show promising\nresults for the NAS Parallel Benchmarks implemented in UPC. A speedup of up to\n5.5x is demonstrated for unmodified and unoptimized codes.

Building upon information\nspectrum concepts, we develop several non-asymptotic inner bounds on channel\ncoding rates over the Gaussian MAC with a given finite blocklength, positive\naverage error probability, and maximal power constraints. Employing Central\nLimit Theorem (CLT) approximations, we also obtain achievable second-order\ncoding rates for the Gaussian MAC based on an explicit expression for its\ndispersion matrix.

In particular, we show that even in the\nvery restricted case in which each bidder has either an additive valuation or a\nunit-demand valuation, there exist instances in which the inefficiency at\nequilibrium grows linearly with the minimum of the number of items and the\nnumber of bidders. Moreover, these inefficient equilibria persist even under\niterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies. Our main result implies\nlinear inefficiency for many natural settings, including auctions with gross\nsubstitute valuations, capacitated valuations, budget-additive valuations, and\nadditive valuations with hard budget constraints on the payments. Another\nimplication is that the inefficiency in sequential auctions is driven by the\nmaximum number of items contained in any player's optimal set, and this is\ntight.

The unique characteristics of LTEs modulation\nand UL resource assignment poses considerable challenges in achieving this goal\nbecause most LTE deployments have 1:1 frequency re-use, and the uplink\ninterference can vary considerably across successive time slots. In this work,\nwe propose LeAP, a measurement data driven machine learning paradigm for power\ncontrol to manage up-link interference in LTE. The data driven approach has the\ninherent advantage that the solution adapts based on network traffic,\npropagation and network topology, that is increasingly heterogeneous with\nmultiple cell-overlays. LeAP system design consists of the following\ncomponents: (i) design of user equipment (UE) measurement statistics that are\nsuccinct, yet expressive enough to capture the network dynamics, and (ii)\ndesign of two learning based algorithms that use the reported measurements to\nset the power control parameters and optimize the network performance. LeAP is\nstandards compliant and can be implemented in centralized SON (self organized\nnetworking) server resource (cloud). We perform extensive evaluations using\nradio network plans from real LTE network operational in a major metro area in\nUnited States.

We divided the time series of the Nikkei 225 index\ninto two periods, an inflationary period and a deflationary period. We have\npreviously [18] found that the distribution of absolute log-returns can be\napproximated by the power-law distribution in the inflationary period, while\nthe distribution of absolute log-returns is well described by the exponential\ndistribution in the deflationary period.\\par To further explore these empirical\nfindings, we have introduced a model of stock markets which was proposed in\n[19,20]. In this model, the stock market is composed of two groups of traders:\n{\\it the fundamentalists}, who believe that the asset price will return to the\nfundamental price, and {\\it the interacting traders}, who can be noise traders.\nWe show through numerical simulation of the model that when the number of\ninteracting traders is greater than the number of fundamentalists, the\npower-law distribution of absolute log-returns is generated by the interacting\ntraders' herd behavior, and, inversely, when the number of fundamentalists is\ngreater than the number of interacting traders, the exponential distribution of\nabsolute log-returns is generated.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures"]}]
