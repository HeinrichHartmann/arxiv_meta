We\ncombine the original HATNet observations and various followup data to jointly\nanalyze the signal content and extract the transit component and use our RV\ndata to aid the global parameter determination. The blend analysis of the\ncombination of multicolor light curves yields the first independent\nconfirmation of the planetary nature of WASP-33b. We clearly identify three\nfrequency components in the 15-21 1/day regime with amplitudes 7-5 mmag. These\nfrequencies correspond to the delta Scuti-type pulsation of the host star. None\nof these pulsation frequencies or their low-order linear combinations are in\nclose resonance with the orbital frequency. We show that these pulsation\ncomponents explain some but not all of the observed transit anomalies. The\ngrand-averaged transit light curve shows that there is a ~1.5 mmag brightening\nshortly after the planet passes the mid-transit phase. Although the duration\nand amplitude of this brightening varies, it is visible even through the direct\ninspections of the individual transit events (some 40-60% of the followup light\ncurves show this phenomenon). We suggest that the most likely explanation of\nthis feature is the presence of a well-populated spot belt which is highly\ninclined to the orbital plane. This geometry is consistent with the inference\nfrom the spectroscopic anomalies. Finally, we constrain the planetary mass to\nM_p=3.27+/-0.73 M_J by using our RV data collected by the TRES spectrograph.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables, submitted to A&A"]}]

When some origins and\ndestinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced,\naccumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem is\naddressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular\ndestinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the\nrebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to \"rebalance the\nrebalancers\" by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with a\ncustomer. Accordingly, in this paper we study how to optimally route the\nrebalancing vehicles and drivers so that stability (in terms of boundedness of\nthe number of waiting customers) is ensured while minimizing the number of\nrebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing\ndrivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can\nfind the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs.\nLeveraging our analysis, we determine the minimum number of drivers and minimum\nnumber of vehicles needed to ensure stability in the system.
