Our results show that\nsolutions of the deterministic equation with randomly selected initial\nconditions display a Gaussian-like density for long time, but the densities are\nsupported on an interval of finite measure.

Several conjectures are formulated for the\nprobabilistic properties of the solution of the differential delay equation.\nNumerical studies suggest that these conjectures could be \"universal\" for\nsimilar types of \"chaotic\" dynamics, but we have been unable to prove this.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures"]}]

A renormalization procedure is needed to make this precise, since $X$\noscillates between $-\\infty$ and $\\infty$ and is not a function in the usual\nsense. This procedure yields the zero measure when $\\gamma=\\sqrt{2d}$.\n  Two methods have been proposed to produce a non-trivial measure when\n$\\gamma=\\sqrt{2d}$. The first involves taking a derivative at\n$\\gamma=\\sqrt{2d}$ (and was studied in an earlier paper by the current\nauthors), while the second involves a modified renormalization scheme. We show\nhere that the two constructions are equivalent and use this fact to deduce\nseveral quantitative properties of the random measure. In particular, we\ncomplete the study of the moments of the derivative multiplicative chaos, which\nallows us to establish the KPZ formula at criticality. The case of\ntwo-dimensional (massless or massive) Gaussian free fields is also covered.\n","Comment: The new version contains the proofs for Free Fields"]}]

In this paper we\nstudy two fundamental questions of detection: first, given a snapshot view of a\n(perhaps vanishingly small) fraction of those infected, under what conditions\nis an epidemic spreading via contact (e.g., Influenza), distinguishable from a\n\"random illness\" operating independently of any contact network (e.g., seasonal\nallergies); second, if we do have an epidemic, under what conditions is it\npossible to determine which network of interactions is the main cause of the\nspread -- the causative network -- without any knowledge of the epidemic, other\nthan the identity of a minuscule subsample of infected nodes?\n  The core, therefore, of this paper, is to obtain an understanding of the\ndiagnostic power of network information. We derive sufficient conditions\nnetworks must satisfy for these problems to be identifiable, and produce\nefficient, highly scalable algorithms that solve these problems. We show that\nthe identifiability condition we give is fairly mild, and in particular, is\nsatisfied by two common graph topologies: the grid, and the Erdos-Renyi graphs.\n"]}]

In this thesis, we use the lifting scheme\nto design wavelets on arbitrary volumes, and in particular on volumes having\nthe structure of the human cortex. These wavelets have an element of randomness\nin their construction, which allows us to repeat the analysis with many\ndifferent realizations of the wavelet bases and averaging the results, a method\nthat improves the power of the analysis. Next, we apply this type of wavelet\ntransforms to the statistical analysis to fMRI data, and we show that it\nenables us to achieve greater spatial localization than other, more standard\ntechniques.\n","Comment: PhD Dissertation, Princeton University, PACM, Adviser: Ingrid\n  Daubechies, September 2012"]}]

On the basis of VLBI experiments\nperformed at 1.6, 5, 8, 15, 22, and 43GHz between 1992-2003 and parallel\nmulti-frequency monitoring of the total flux density, we investigated the\nvariability of total flux density and source structure. Below 8 GHz, the\npoint-like VLBI source is affected by scatter-broadening of the turbulent\ninterstellar medium, which is located along the line of sight and likely\nassociated with the Cygnus region. We present and discuss the measured\nfrequency dependence of the source size, which shows a power-law with slope of\n-1.91+/-0.05. From the measured scattering angle at 1GHz of 77.1+/-4.0mas a\nSM=0.43+/-0.04 m^{-20/3} kpc is derived, consistent with the general properties\nof the ISM in this direction. The decreasing effect of angular broadening\ntowards higher frequencies allows to study the internal structure of the\nsource. Above 8GHz new VLBI observations reveal a one-sided slightly\nsouth-bending core-jet structure, with stationary and apparent superluminally\nmoving jet components. The jet components move on non-ballistic trajectories.\nIn AGN, total flux density variations are often related to the emergence of new\nVLBI components. However, during almost eleven years no new component was\nejected in B2005+403. In the flux density variability a trough is observed at\n5-37 GHz between 1996 and 2001. This can be explained as a blending effect of\njet component fluxes. Dense in time sampled flux density monitoring\nobservations reveal intra-day variability at 1.6GHz impling a second, less\ndense or turbulent scattering screen at few to hundred parsec distance.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables, accepted for publication in Astronomy\n  and Astrophysics"]}]

These are usually\nattributed to the presence of turbulent intervening plasma along the line of\nsight. Here, two of such effects are presented. The line of sight of B 2005+403\npasses through the heavily scattered region of Cygnus, which causes substantial\nangular broadening of the source images obtained at frequencies between 0.6 GHz\nand 8 GHz. At higher frequencies, however the intrinsic source structure shines\nthrough.
