This is inconsistent with one of the primary results of\nclassic dynamical simulations of the widely accepted giant impact model for the\nformation of the Moon, namely that most of the mass of the Moon originates from\nthe impactor, not Earth.\n  Resolution of this discrepancy without changing the main premises of the\ngiant impact model requires total isotopic homogenisation of Earth and impactor\nmaterial after the impact for a wide range of elements including O, Si, K, Ti,\nNd and W. Even if this process could explain the O isotope similarity, it is\nunlikely to work for the much heavier, refractory elements. Given the\nincreasing uncertainty surrounding the giant impact model in light of these\ngeochemical data, alternative hypotheses for lunar formation should be\nexplored. In this paper, we revisit the hypothesis that the Moon was formed\ndirectly from terrestrial mantle material. We show that the dynamics of this\nscenario requires a large amount of energy, almost instantaneously generated\nadditional energy. The only known source for this additional energy is nuclear\nfission. We show that it is feasible to form the Moon through the ejection of\nterrestrial silicate material triggered by a nuclear explosion at Earths\ncore-mantle boundary (CMB), causing a shock wave propagating through the Earth.\nHydrodynamic modelling of this scenario shows that a shock wave created by\nrapidly expanding plasma resulting from the explosion disrupts and expels\noverlying mantle and crust material.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 5 figures, 1 table"]}]

Therefore, the absence of a\nHII region from most type II ccSNe merely reflects the longer lifetime of stars\nwith <12 Msun than giant HII regions. Conversely, the association of a HII\nregion with most type Ib/c ccSNe is due to the shorter lifetime of stars with\n>12 Msun stars than the duty cycle of giant HII regions. Therefore, we conclude\nthat the observed association between certain ccSNe and HII provides only weak\nconstraints upon their progenitor masses.

A central problem is determining the probability that a\nsmall number of mutants overtake a population. Currently, Monte Carlo\nsimulations are used for estimating such fixation probabilities on general\ndirected graphs, since no good analytical methods exist. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel deterministic framework for computing fixation probabilities\nfor strongly connected, directed, weighted evolutionary graphs under neutral\ndrift. We show how this framework can also be used to calculate the expected\nnumber of mutants at a given time step (even if we relax the assumption that\nthe graph is strongly connected), how it can extend to other related models\n(e.g. voter model), how our framework can provide non-trivial bounds for\nfixation probability in the case of an advantageous mutant, and how it can be\nused to find a non-trivial lower bound on the mean time to fixation. We provide\nvarious experimental results determining fixation probabilities and expected\nnumber of mutants on different graphs.
