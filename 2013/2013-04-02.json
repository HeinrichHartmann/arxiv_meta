The simplest circuit of the flux qubit is a superconducting loop\ninterrupted by a Josephson nanoscale tunnel junction. The tunneling amplitude\nbetween two macroscopically different states can be essentially increased, by\nengineering of the qubit circuit, if tunnel junction is replaced by a ScS\ncontact. However, only Josephson tunnel junctions are particularly suitable for\nlarge-scale integration circuits and quantum detectors with preset-day\ntechnology. To overcome this difficulty we consider here the flux qubit with\nhigh-level energy separation between \"ground\" and \"excited\" states, which\nconsists of a superconducting loop with two low-capacitance Josephson tunnel\njunctions in series. We demonstrate that for real parameters of resonant\nsuperposition between the two macroscopic states the tunneling amplitude can\nreach values greater than 1K.

The model we consider is the DQC1 or `power of one qubit'\nmodel. I show that there is minimal bipartite entanglement in a typical\ninstance of the DQC1 circuit and even put an upper bound on the possible amount\nof entanglement. This limited amount of entanglement, however, does not imply\nthat the system is classically simulatable. A matrix product state (MPS)\nalgorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential\nclassical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and\nthe amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I\nsuggest, can be filled by quantum discord. I calculate it in a typical instance\nof the DQC1 circuit and find that the amount of discord is a constant fraction\nof the maximum possible discord for a system of that size. This allows an\ninterpretation of quantum discord as the resource that drives mixed-state\nquantum computation. I also study quantum discord as a quantity of independent\ninterest. Its role in the phenomenon of entanglement distribution is studied\nthrough an easily comprehensible example.\n  This thesis also contains discussions on the relation between the complexity\nclasses P, BQP and DQC1. Additional material is presented on the connections\nbetween the DQC1 model, Jones polynomials and statistical mechanics. The thesis\nconcludes with a discussion of a few open problems related to the DQC1 model,\nthe quantum discord and their scope in quantum information science.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, defended in June 2008. 130 pages, 14 figures. arXiv admin\n  note: text overlap with arXiv:quant-ph/0201143 by other authors"]}]

First we argue in favor of the thesis that all\nmultiverses except Tegmark's <<mathematical multiverse>> are too small to\nexplain the fine tuning, so that they merely shift the problem up one level.\nBut the <<mathematical multiverse>> is surely too large. To prove this\nassessment, we have performed a number of experiments with cellular automata of\ncomplex behavior, which can be considered as universes in the mathematical\nmultiverse. The analogy between what happens in some automata (in particular\nConway's <<Game of Life>>) and the real world is very strong. But if the\nresults of our experiments can be extrapolated to our universe, we should\nexpect to inhabit -- in the context of the multiverse -- a world in which at\nleast some of the laws and constants of nature should show a certain time\ndependence. Actually, the probability of our existence in a world such as ours\nwould be mathematically equal to zero. In consequence, the results presented in\nthis paper can be considered as an inkling that the hypothesis of the\nmultiverse, whatever its type, does not offer an adequate explanation for the\npeculiarities of the physical laws in our world.

Although larval\nechinoderms are bilaterally symmetric, the adult body seems to abandon the\nlarval body plan and to develop independently a new structure with different\nsymmetries. The prevalent pentamer structure, the asymmetry of Loven's rule and\nthe variable location of the periproct and madrepore present enormous\ndifficulties in homologizing structures across the major clades, despite the\nexcellent fossil record. This irregularity in body forms seems to place\nechinoderms outside the other deuterostomes.

This\nhypothesis implies that the adult echinoderm body can be derived directly from\nthe larval bilateral symmetry and thus firmly ranks even the adult echinoderms\namong the bilaterians.

Taking in recent years particles' statistics explicitly into account,\nwithin the MCTDH for fermions (MCTDHF) and for bosons (MCTDHB), has opened up\nfurther opportunities to treat larger systems of interacting identical\nparticles, primarily in laser-atom and cold-atom physics. With the increase of\nexperimental capabilities to simultaneously trap mixtures of two, three, and\npossibly even multiple kinds of interacting composite identical particles\ntogether, we set up the stage in the present work and specify the MCTDH method\nfor such cases. Explicitly, the MCTDH method for systems with three kinds of\nidentical particles interacting via all combinations of two- and three-body\nforces is presented, and the resulting equations-of-motion are briefly\ndiscussed. All four possible mixtures of fermions and bosons are presented in a\nunified manner. Particular attention is paid to represent the coefficients'\npart of the equations-of-motion in a compact recursive form in terms of\none-body density operators only. The recursion utilizes the recently proposed\nCombinadic-based mapping for fermionic and bosonic operators in Fock space\n[Phys. Rev.

The\nphenomenological model used is the Tripartite model that has been successfully\napplied to the average LDOS(E) previously. The resulting energy scale maps show\na structured patchwork disorder of three energy scales, which can be described\nby a single underlying disordered parameter. This spatial disorder structure is\nuniversal for all dopings and energy scales. It is independent of the oxygen\ndopant negative energy resonances and the interface between the different\npatches takes the form of a shortened lifetime pseudogap/superconducting gap\nstate. The relationship between the energy scales and the spatial modulations\nof the dispersive QPI, static q1* modulation and the pseudogap shows that the\nenergy scales signatures in the LDOS(E) are tied to the onset and termination\nof the spatial excitations. The static q1* modulations local energy range is\nmeasured and its signature in the LDOS(E) is the kink, whose number of states\nare modulated with a wave vector of q1*. This analysis of both the LDOS(r,E)\nand the spatial modulations in q-space show a picture of a single underlying\ndisordered parameter that determines both the LDOS(E) structure as well as the\nenergy ranges of the QPI, q1* modulation and the pseudogap states.

Ingoli's emphasis on the\nscientific arguments of Brahe, and his lack of emphasis on theological\narguments, raises the question of whether the condemnation of the Copernican\ntheory was, in contrast to how it is usually viewed, essentially scientific in\nnature, following the ideas of Brahe.\n","Comment: 61 pages (including two appendices), 4 figures.

Because of its\ngenerality and applications, the problem of Boolean Satisfiability (aka SAT) is\noften used as a vehicle for investigating this question. A signal result from\nthese studies is that the hardness of SAT problems exhibits a dramatic\neasy-to-hard phase transition with respect to the problem constrainedness. Past\nstudies have however focused mostly on SAT instances generated using uniform\nrandom distributions, where all constraints are independently generated, and\nthe problem variables are all considered of equal importance. These assumptions\nare unfortunately not satisfied by most real problems. Our project aims for a\ndeeper understanding of hardness of SAT problems that arise in practice. We\nstudy two key questions: (i) How does easy-to-hard transition change with more\nrealistic distributions that capture neighborhood sensitivity and\nrich-get-richer aspects of real problems and (ii) Can these changes be\nexplained in terms of the network properties (such as node centrality and\nsmall-worldness) of the clausal networks of the SAT problems. Our results,\nbased on extensive empirical studies and network analyses, provide important\nstructural and computational insights into realistic SAT problems. Our\nextensive empirical studies show that SAT instances from realistic\ndistributions do exhibit phase transition, but the transition occurs sooner (at\nlower values of constrainedness) than the instances from uniform random\ndistribution.

In particular, I\nargue that the physical explanation for quantum speedup is precisely the fact\nthat the phenomenon of quantum entanglement enables a quantum computer to fully\nexploit the representational capacity of Hilbert space. This is impossible for\nclassical systems, joint states of which must always be representable as\nproduct states.\n  Chapter 2 begins with a discussion of the most popular of the candidate\nphysical explanations for quantum speedup: the many worlds explanation. I argue\nthat unlike the neo-Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics it does not\nhave the conceptual resources required to overcome the `preferred basis\nobjection'. I further argue that the many worlds explanation, at best, can\nserve as a good description of the physical process which takes place in\nso-called network-based computation, but that it is incompatible with other\nmodels of computation such as cluster state quantum computing. I next consider,\nin Chapter 3, a common component of most other candidate explanations of\nquantum speedup: quantum entanglement. I investigate whether entanglement can\nbe said to be a necessary component of any explanation for quantum speedup, and\nI consider two major purported counter-examples to this claim. I argue that\nneither of these, in fact, show that entanglement is unnecessary for speedup,\nand that, on the contrary, we should conclude that it is. In Chapters 4 and 5 I\nthen ask whether entanglement can be said to be sufficient as well. In Chapter\n4 I argue that despite a result that seems to indicate the contrary,\nentanglement, considered as a resource, can be seen as sufficient to enable\nquantum speedup.

Although, basically, the distributed algorithm has been implemented on\ntop of its sequential conterpart, some changes, which improved not only the\nparallel performance but also the quality of solutions, were proposed here.\nWhen compared to other lower bounding methods found in the literature, our\nalgorithm generates the best known lower bounds for 26 out of the 28 tested\ninstances, reaching the optimal solution in 18 of them.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

This is a variational problem involving\nboth the {\\it elastic deformation} of the film and substrate and the {\\it\ngeometry} of the blistered region. It involves three small parameters: the {\\it\nnondimensionalized thickness} of the film, the {\\it compliance ratio} of the\nfilm/substrate pair and the {\\it mismatch strain}.

The PDFs of Orion B (Aquila) show a lognormal distribution\nfor low column densities until Av 3 (6), and a power-law tail for high column\ndensities, consistent with a rho r^-2 profile for the equivalent spherical\ndensity distribution. The PDF of Orion B is broadened by external compression\ndue to the nearby OB stellar aggregates. The PDF of a quiescent subregion of\nthe non-star-forming Polaris cloud is nearly lognormal, indicating that\nsupersonic turbulence governs the density distribution.

Here we review our recent\ntheoretical studies using density functional calculations on two types of\ndefects in carbon nanostructures: Substitutional doping with transition metals,\nand sp$^3$-type defects created by covalent functionalization with organic and\ninorganic molecules. We focus on such defects because they can be used to\ncreate and control magnetism in graphene-based materials.

We identify three different regimes, associated with the occupation of\ndistinct hybridization levels, which determine the magnetic properties obtained\nwith this type of doping; ii) A spin moment of 1.0 $\\mu_B$ is always induced by\nchemical functionalization when a molecule chemisorbs on a graphene layer via a\nsingle C-C (or other weakly polar) covalent bond. The magnetic coupling between\nadsorbates shows a key dependence on the sublattice adsorption site. This\neffect is similar to that of H adsorption, however, with universal character;\niii) The spin moment of substitutional metal impurities can be controlled using\nstrain. In particular, we show that although Ni substitutionals are\nnon-magnetic in flat and unstrained graphene, the magnetism of these defects\ncan be activated by applying either uniaxial strain or curvature to the\ngraphene layer.

We show that the statistics of the fiber's frequency\nresponse are independent of frequency. This simplifies the computation of the\naverage Shannon capacity of the fiber. We also provide an input-output coupling\nstrategy that leads to an increase in the overall capacity. This strategy can\nbe used whenever channel state information (CSI) is available at the\ntransmitter. We show that the capacity of an Nt by Nt MIMO system over a fiber\nwith M>>Nt modes can approach the capacity of an Nt-mode fiber with no\nmode-dependent losses. We finally present a statistical input-output coupling\nmodel in order to quantify the loss in capacity when CSI is not available at\nthe transmitter. It turns out that the loss, relative to Nt-mode fibers, is\nminimal (less than 0.5 dB) for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)\nand a reasonable range of MDLs.\n"]}]

The notions of termination and almost\ntermination are proposed for quantum loops, and the function computed by a\nquantum loop is defined. To show their expressive power, quantum loops are\napplied in describing quantum walks. Necessary and sufficient conditions for\ntermination and almost termination of a general quantum loop on any mixed input\nstate are presented. A quantum loop is said to be (almost) terminating if it\n(almost) terminates on any input state. We show that a quantum loop is almost\nterminating if and only if it is uniformly almost terminating. It is observed\nthat a small disturbance either on the unitary transformation in the loop body\nor on the measurement in the loop guard can make any quantum loop (almost)\nterminating. Moreover, a representation of the function computed by a quantum\nloop is given in terms of finite summations of matrices. To illustrate the\nnotions and results obtained in this paper, two simplest classes of quantum\nloop programs, one qubit quantum loops, and two qubit quantum loops defined by\ncontrolled gates, are carefully examined.\n"]}]
