A representation rho: Gamma \\to\nSO(2,n) is quasi-Fuchsian if it is faithfull, discrete, and preserves an\nacausal subset in the boundary of anti-de Sitter space - a particular case is\nthe case of Fuchsian representations, ie. composition of the inclusions of\nGamma in SO(1,n) and of SO(1,n) in SO(2,n). We prove that if a representation\nis Anosov in the sense of Labourie then it is also quasi-Fuchsian. We also show\nthat Fuchsian representations are Anosov : the fact that all quasi-Fuchsian\nrepresentations are Anosov will be proved in a second part by T. Barbot. The\nstudy involves the geometry of locally anti-de Sitter spaces: quasi-Fuchsian\nrepresentations are holonomy representations of globally hyperbolic spacetimes\ndiffeomorphic to the product R \\times Gamma\\H^n and locally modeled on the\nanti-de Sitter space.\n","Comment: 19 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:math/0701452 by other authors"]}]
