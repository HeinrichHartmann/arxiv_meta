In a barred galaxy, the increase results from a combination of\nthree separate factors (a) orientation and inclination effects; (b) angular\nmomentum transport by the bar that results in an increase in the central mass\ndensity; (c) an increase in the vertical and radial velocity anisotropy of\nstars in the vicinity of the SMBH. In contrast the growth of the SMBH in an\nunbarred galaxy causes the velocity distribution in the inner part of the\nnucleus to become less radially anisotropic. The increase in $\\sigma$ following\nthe growth of the SMBH is insensitive to a variation of a factor of 10 in the\nfinal mass of the SMBH, showing that it is the growth process rather than the\nactual SMBH mass that alters bar evolution in a way that increases $\\sigma$.

We\nhave previously modeled M dwarfs in the context of a criterion due to Gough &\nTayler in which magnetic fields inhibit the onset of convection according to a\nphysics-based prescription. New constraints on the models of M dwarfs are now\nprovided by measurements of lithium abundances. The key aspect of Li in terms\nof setting constraints on magnetic modeling is that Li burning starts at T =\n2.5 MK, and temperatures of just such magnitude are associated with the base of\nthe convection zone: magnetic inhibition of convective onset can shift this\nbase slightly closer to the surface, i.e. to slightly lower temperatures,\nthereby reducing the amount of Li depletion compared to a non-magnetic model.\nIn the present paper, we consider how our magneto-convection models handle the\nnew test of stellar structure provided by Li measurements.

By\nanalysing published data on human follicular growth and granulosa cell\nexpansion during follicular maturation we find that the 4-fold increase of the\nantral follicle diameter is entirely driven by an increase in the follicular\nfluid volume, while the thickness of the surrounding granulosa layer remains\nconstant at about 45+/-10 mkm. Based on the measured kinetic constants, the\nmodel reveals that the observed fall in the gonadotropin concentration from\nperipheral blood circulation to the follicular antrum is a result of\nsequestration in the granulosa. The model further shows that as a result of\nsequestration, an increased granulosa thickness cannot substantially increase\nestradiol production but rather deprives the oocyte from gonadotropins. Larger\nanimals (with a larger blood volume) require more estradiol as produced by the\novaries to downregulate FSH-secretion in the pituitary. Larger follicle\ndiameters result in larger follicle surface areas for constant granulosa layer\nthickness. The reported increase in follicular surface area in larger species\nindeed correlates linearly both with species mass and with the predicted\nincrease in estradiol output.

These estimates are very similar to the ones used by\nGriffiths and Cornalba to define Hermitian metrics of finite order. We then\ngeneralize the Vanishing Theorem of Griffiths and Cornalba to the Finsler\ncontext.
