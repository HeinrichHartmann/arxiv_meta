So far, theoretical explanations for body-size patterns in periodic\npopulation dynamics have received little attention.

Here, oscillations expected from a one-species (delayed\nlogistic) and a two-species (Rosenzweig-MacArthur) model were compared to\ncycles observed in laboratory experiments and field surveys for a wide range of\ninvertebrates and vertebrates. The parameters in the equations were linked to\nbody mass, using a consistent set of allometric relationships that was\ncalibrated on 230 regressions. Oscillation period and amplitude predicted by\nthe models were validated with data taken from literature. Results. The\ncollected data showed that cycle times of herbivores scaled to species body\nmass with a slope up to 1/4 as expected from the models. With exception of\naquatic herbi-detritivores, intercepts were observed at the level calculated by\nthe two-species model. Remarkably, oscillation periods were size-independent\nfor predatory invertebrates, fishes, birds and mammals. Average cycles were of\n4 to 5 years, similar to those predicted by the one-species model with a\nsize-independent delay of 1 year. The consistent difference between herbivores\nand the carnivores could be explained by the models from the small parameter\nspace for consumer-resource cycles in generalist predators. As expected,\namplitudes recorded in the field did not scale to size. Observed oscillation\nperiods were generally within a factor of about 2 from the values expected from\nthe models. This demonstrates that a set of slopes and intercepts for age and\ndensity parameters applicable to a wide range of species allows a reasonable\nestimate of independently measured cycle times.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 50 references"]}]

This is the\nfirst time that the nonlinear matter and velocity fields have been resolved to\nsuch a high level of accuracy over a broad range of scales in this class of\nmodels. We find significant deviations from the clustering signal in standard\ngravity, with an enhanced boost in power on large scales and stronger damping\non small scales in the f(R) models compared to GR at redshifts z<1. We measure\nthe velocity divergence (P_\\theta \\theta) and matter (P_\\delta \\delta) power\nspectra and find a large deviation in the ratios \\sqrt{P_\\theta \\theta/P_\\delta\n\\delta} and P_\\delta \\theta/P_\\delta\\delta, between the f(R) models and GR for\n0.03<k/(h/Mpc)<0.5. In linear theory these ratios equal the growth rate of\nstructure on large scales. Our results show that the simulated ratios agree\nwith the growth rate for each cosmology (which is scale dependent in the case\nof modified gravity) only for extremely large scales, k<0.06h/Mpc at z=0. The\nvelocity power spectrum is substantially different in the f(R) models compared\nto GR, suggesting that this observable is a sensitive probe of modified\ngravity. We demonstrate how to extract the matter and velocity power spectra\nfrom the 2D redshift space power spectrum, P(k,\\mu), and can recover the\nnonlinear matter power spectrum to within a few percent for k<0.1h/Mpc.\nHowever, the model fails to describe the shape of the 2D power spectrum\ndemonstrating that an improved model is necessary in order to reconstruct the\nvelocity power spectrum accurately. The same model can match the monopole\nmoment to within 3% for GR and 10% for the f(R) cosmology at k<0.2 h/Mpc at\nz=1.

Purpose: We\ninvestigate the interpretation of third-minimum configurations in terms of\ndimolecular states. We study the isentropic potential-energy surfaces of\nselected even-even thorium and uranium isotopes at several excitation energies.\nIn order to understand the driving effects behind the presence of third minima,\nwe study the interplay between pairing and shell effects. Methods: We use the\nfinite-temperature superfluid nuclear density functional theory. We consider a\ntraditional functional, SkM*, and a recent functional, UNEDF1, optimized for\nfission studies. Results: We predict very shallow or no third minima in the\npotential-energy surfaces of 232Th and 232U. In Th and U isotopes with N=136\nand 138, the third minima are deeper.
