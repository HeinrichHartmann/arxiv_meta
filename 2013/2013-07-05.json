In this paper the cooling force is calculated\nin a model of binary collisions (BC) between ions and magnetized electrons, in\nwhich the Coulomb interaction is treated up to second-order as a perturbation\nto the helical motion of the electrons. The calculations are done with the help\nof an improved BC theory which is uniformly valid for any strength of the\nmagnetic field and where the second-order two-body forces are treated in the\ninteraction in Fourier space without specifying the interaction potential. The\ncooling force is explicitly calculated for a regularized and screened potential\nwhich is both of finite range and less singular than the Coulomb interaction at\nthe origin.

This minimization problem is combinatorial\nin nature, and so far the best known deterministic algorithm claims the use of\nat most $0.75\\times 2^n$ of the $2^n$ total possible monomials. In this paper,\nthe basic methods of representing a Boolean function by polynomials are\nexamined, and an alternative approach to this problem is proposed. It is shown\nthat it is possible to use at most $0.5\\times 2^n = 2^{n-1}$ monomials based on\nthe $\\{0, 1\\}$ binary inputs by introducing extra variables, and at the same\ntime keeping the degree upper bound at $n$. An algorithm for further reduction\nof the number of terms that used in a polynomial representation is provided.\nExamples show that in certain applications, the improvement achieved by the\nproposed method over the existing methods is significant.\n","Comment: A shorter version of this article appeared in LNCS 6677, 2011"]}]

Method: The over 20 year history of the web makes it possible to make\nshort-term projections on future growth. The longer history of hard disk drives\n(and smart phone memory card) makes it possible to make short-term hardware\nprojections. Analysis: Historical data on Internet uptake and hardware growth\nis extrapolated. Results: It is predicted that within a decade the storage\ncapacity of a single hard drive will exceed the size of the index of the web at\nthat time. Within another decade it will be possible to store the entire\nsearchable text on the same hard drive. Within another decade the entire\nsearchable web (including images) will also fit.

In one model the user's computer is an active part of the\ndistributed search architecture. They search a pre-loaded snapshot (back-file)\nof the web on their local device which frees up the online data centre for\nsearching just the difference between the snapshot and the current time.\nAdvantageously this also makes it possible to search when the user is\ndisconnected from the Internet.

It follows from our main result that such C*-algebras are\nclassifiable by Elliott invariants. Our theorem requires finitely many tracial\nstates that all induce the same state on the K_0-group; in particular we do not\nrequire that projections separate tracial states. We apply our results to\nclassify some examples of C*-algebras constructed by Elliott to exhaust the\ninvariant. We also give an alternate way to classify examples of Lin and Matui\nof C*-algebras of minimal dynamical systems. In this way our result can be\nviewed as a first step towards removing the requirement that projections\nseparate tracial states in the classification theorem for C*-algebras of\nminimal dynamical systems given by Toms and the second named author.\n","Comment: 61 pages"]}]

As a result,\nseveral alterations and fixes have been suggested in the literature to correct\nfor these findings. A contribution of this work is to investigate the effects\nof replacing the classification stage of the DCA (which is known to be flawed)\nwith a traditional machine learning technique. This work goes on to question\nthe merits of those unique properties of the DCA that are yet to be thoroughly\nanalysed. If none of these properties can be found to have a benefit over\ntraditional approaches, then \"fixing\" the DCA is arguably less efficient than\nsimply creating a new algorithm. This work examines the dynamic filtering\nproperty of the DCA and questions the utility of this unique feature for the\nanomaly detection problem. It is found that this feature, while advantageous\nfor noisy, time-ordered classification, is not as useful as a traditional\nstatic filter for processing a synthetic dataset. It is concluded that there\nare still unique features of the DCA left to investigate. Areas that may be of\nbenefit to the Artificial Immune Systems community are suggested.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Artificial Immune\n  Systems (ICARIS 2011), LNCS Volume 6825, Cambridge, UK, pp 173-186, 2011"]}]

If intrinsic, the non-detection of 250\nTeV-1 PeV neutrinos disfavors the single power-law spectrum model for the\nTeV-PeV non-atmospheric neutrinos at a confidence level of ~ 2\\sigma. We then\ninterpret the current neutrino data with a two-component spectrum model. One\nhas a flat spectrum with a cutoff at the energy ~ 250 TeV and the other has a\nsharp peak at ~1 PeV. The former is likely via pp collision while the latter\nmay be generated by the photomeson interaction.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure"]}]
