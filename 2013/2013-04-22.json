Low-ionization lines of O I, N I, Si II, C\nII, and Fe II, are present in the low-state spectra (April 2004) at a velocity\nv_shift=-250 km/s (system A_l), and additional high-ionization lines of C IV\nand N V appear in the high-state spectra (July 2004) at v_shift=-250 km/s\n(system A_h) and at v_shift=-840 km/s (system B). The absence of absorption\nfrom the low metastable levels of Si II implies a density <~10^3 cm^(-3) for\nsystem A_l, indicating a location outside the narrow line region (NLR). System\nA_h is peculiar as only N V absorption is clearly detected. A high N V/C IV\nabsorption ratio is expected for a high metallicity absorber, but this is\nexcluded here as the metallicity of the host galaxy and of the nuclear gas is\nsignificantly subsolar. A simple acceptable model for systems A_h and B is an\nabsorber located between the broad line region (BLR) and the NLR, which absorbs\nonly the continuum and the BLR. At the low-state the strong narrow emission\nlines of C IV and N V dominate the spectrum, making the absorption invisible.\nAt the high-state the absorbed continuum and BLR emission dominate the\nspectrum. Thus, the change in the observed absorption does not reflect a change\nin the absorber, but rather a change in the continuum and BLR emission from\nbehind the absorber, relative to the emission from the NLR in front of the\nabsorber. Studies of the absorption line variability in highly variable objects\ncan thus break the degeneracy in the absorber distance determination inherent\nto single epoch studies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal"]}]

However, this regime\nwas not accessible in traditional Brillouin systems since backscattering\nenforces high acoustical frequencies associated with high mechanical damping.\nRecently, forward Brillouin scattering in microcavities has allowed access to\nlow-frequency acoustical modes where mechanical dissipation is lower than\noptical dissipation, in accordance with the requirements for cooling. Here we\nexperimentally demonstrate cooling via such a forward Brillouin process in a\nmicroresonator. We show two regimes of operation for the Brillouin process:\nacoustical amplification as is traditional, but also for the first time, a\nBrillouin cooling regime. Cooling is mediated by an optical pump, and scattered\nlight, that beat and electrostrictively attenuate the Brownian motion of the\nmechanical mode.\n","Comment: Supplementary material included"]}]

Partial frequency redistribution (PRD) is necessary to interpret the\nlinear polarization observed in strong resonance lines. Usually angle-averaged\nPRD functions are used to analyze linear polarization. However it is\nestablished that angle-dependent PRD functions are often necessary to interpret\npolarization profiles formed in the presence of weak magnetic fields. Our aim\nis to present an efficient decomposition technique, and the numerical method to\nsolve the concerned angle-dependent line transfer problem. Together with the\nstandard Stokes decomposition technique we employ Fourier expansion over the\noutgoing azimuth angle to express in a more convenient form, the\nangle-dependent PRD function for the Hanle effect. It allows the use of\nangle-dependent frequency domains of Bommier to solve the Hanle transfer\nproblem. Such an approach is self-consistent and accurate compared to a recent\napproach where angle-averaged frequency domains were used to solve the same\nproblem. We show that it is necessary to incorporate angle-dependent frequency\ndomains instead of angle-averaged frequency domains to solve the Hanle transfer\nproblem accurately, especially for the Stokes U parameter. The importance of\nusing angle-dependent domains has been highlighted by taking the example of\nHanle effect in the case of line transfer with vertical magnetic fields in a\nslab atmosphere.

To explain this contradiction we propose that superfast charge\ntransitions are possible between base pairs on individual DNA fragments\nresulting in the establishment of a quasi-equilibrium charge distribution\nduring the time less than that of charge solvation. In other words, we\nhypothesize these states irrespective of the nature of a mechanism responsible\nfor their establishment, whether it be a hopping mechanism, or a band\nmechanism, or superexchange, or polaron transport, etc., leaving aside the\ndebates of which one is more advantageous.

In a solution,\nof great importance is the charge solvation which decreases the transfer rate\n$10^7 - 10^8$ times as compared with a dry DNA. We consider the conditions\nunder which the superfast charge transfer in a DNA leading to quasi-equilibrium\ndistributions of polarons in a duplex is possible.
