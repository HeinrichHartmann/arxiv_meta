In this paper, we\npresent a novel grammar representation that allows efficient random access to\nany character or substring without decompressing the string.\n  Let $S$ be a string of length $N$ compressed into a context-free grammar\n$\\mathcal{S}$ of size $n$. We present two representations of $\\mathcal{S}$\nachieving $O(\\log N)$ random access time, and either $O(n\\cdot \\alpha_k(n))$\nconstruction time and space on the pointer machine model, or $O(n)$\nconstruction time and space on the RAM. Here, $\\alpha_k(n)$ is the inverse of\nthe $k^{th}$ row of Ackermann's function. Our representations also efficiently\nsupport decompression of any substring in $S$: we can decompress any substring\nof length $m$ in the same complexity as a single random access query and\nadditional $O(m)$ time. Combining these results with fast algorithms for\nuncompressed approximate string matching leads to several efficient algorithms\nfor approximate string matching on grammar-compressed strings without\ndecompression. For instance, we can find all approximate occurrences of a\npattern $P$ with at most $k$ errors in time $O(n(\\min\\{|P|k, k^4 + |P|\\} + \\log\nN) + occ)$, where $occ$ is the number of occurrences of $P$ in $S$.

Fatigue describes the crack formation\nin the material under cyclic loading. Activation and deactivation operations of\ntechnical units are important examples in engineering where fatigue and\nespecially low-cycle fatigue (LCF) play an essential role. A significant\nscatter in fatigue life for many materials results in the necessity of advanced\nprobabilistic models for fatigue. Moreover, optimization of reliability is of\nvital interest in engineering, where with respect to fatigue the cost\nfunctionals are motivated by the predicted probability for the integrity of the\ncomponent after a certain number of load cycles.

This\ntranslates the problem of optimal reliability in the framework of shape\noptimization. The cost functionals derived in this way for realistic optimal\nreliability problems are too singular to be $H^1$-lower semi-continuous as many\ndamage mechanisms, like LCF, lead to crack initiation as a function of the\nstress at the component's surface. Realistic crack formation models therefore\nimpose a new challenge to the theory of shape optimization.

We\nstudy the background and perturbation evolution and calculate the resulting\nCosmic Microwave Background anisotropy spectra. The greater the fraction of\ndark matter coupled to the scalar field and the stronger the coupling strength,\nthe greater the deviation of the background evolution from LCDM. Previous work,\nwith a single coupled dark matter species, has found an upper limit on the\ncoupling strength of order O(0.1). We find that with a coupling of this\nmagnitude more than half the dark matter can be coupled to a scalar field\nwithout producing any significant deviations from LCDM.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures, minor changes"]}]

Our\narguments are based on nearly-resonant interactions of the R mode with pairs of\n\"daughter modes\". The amplitude of the R mode saturates at the lowest value for\nwhich parametric instability leads to significant excitation of a particular\npair of daughters. The lower bound on this limiting amplitude is proportional\nto the damping rate of the daughter modes that are excited parametrically.\nBased on this picture, we show that if modes damp because of dissipation in a\nvery thin boundary layer at the crust-core boundary then spin up to frequencies\nlarger than about 300 Hz does not occur. Within this conventional scenario the\nR mode saturates at an amplitude that is too large for angular momentum gain\nfrom accretion to overcome gravitational loss to gravitational radiation. We\nconclude that lower dissipation is required for spin up to frequencies much\nhigher than 300 Hz. We conjecture that if the transition from the fluid core to\nthe crystalline crust occurs over a distance much longer than 1 cm then a sharp\nviscous boundary layer fails to form. In this case, damping is due to shear\nviscosity dissipation integrated over the entire star; the rate is slower than\nif a viscous boundary layer forms. We use statistical arguments and scaling\nrelations to estimate the lowest parametric instability threshold from first\nprinciples. The resulting saturation amplitudes are low enough to permit spin\nup to higher frequencies. Further, we show that the requirement that the lowest\nparametric instability amplitude be small enough to allow continued spin up\nimposes an upper bound to the frequencies that may be attained via accretion\nthat may plausibly be about 750 Hz.

This stochasticity is usually modeled as Poisson shot\nnoise, which is constant as a function of wavenumber with amplitude given by\n1/n, where n is the number density of galaxies. Here we use dark matter haloes\nin N-body simulations to show evidence for deviations from this simple\nbehaviour and develop models that explain the behaviour of the large scale\nstochasticity. First, haloes are extended, non-overlapping objects, i.e., their\ncorrelation function needs to go to -1 on small scales. This leads to a\nnegative correction to the stochasticity relative to the Poisson value at low\nwavenumber k, decreasing to zero for wavenumbers large compared to the inverse\nexclusion scale. Second, haloes show a non-linear enhancement of clustering\noutside the exclusion scale, leading to a positive stochasticity correction.\nBoth of these effects go to zero for high-k, making the stochasticity scale\ndependent even for k<0.1 h/Mpc. We show that the corrections in the low-k\nregime are the same in Eulerian and Lagrangian space, but that the transition\nscale is pushed to smaller scales for haloes observed at present time, relative\nto the initial conditions. These corrections vary with halo mass and redshift.\nWe also discuss simple applications of these effects to the galaxy samples with\nnon-vanishing satellite fraction, where the stochasticity can again deviate\nstrongly from the fiducial Poisson expectation.

A stochastic\nbackground of GWs from the incoherent superposition of many inspiraling\nsupermassive black hole binaries at nHz frequencies is likely to be the\ndominant GW signal detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Even though one\nmight expect a background composed of a high-redshift cosmological population\nof sources to be fairly isotropic, deviations from isotropy may be indicative\nof local GW hotspots or some form of continuous anisotropy in the\nangular-distribution of GW-power. A GWB induces time-of-arrival deviations in\npulsar signals which are correlated between separated pulsars. In an isotropic\nbackground this cross-correlation follows a distinctive relationship, known as\nthe Hellings and Downs curve, that depends only on the angular separation of\nthe pulsars. If the background is anisotropic, the cross-correlation is\ndifferent, but predictable, and also depends on the absolute position of the\npulsars. By simulating datasets containing GWBs with various anisotropic\nconfigurations, we have explored the prospects for constraining anisotropy\nusing near future data. We find that at moderate to high signal to noise ratio\nthe assumption of isotropy is no longer an appropriate description of the\nsimulated background.

The bottom\nline is that the bounds coming from the same sign di-lepton analysis are\ncomparable for our model and the simplified model studied assuming BR(gluino ->\nt tbar neutralino) = 100%. However the bounds coming from the purely hadronic\nanalyses for our model are 10 - 20% lower than obtained for the simplified\nmodels. This is due to the fact that for our models the branching ratio for the\ndecay gluino -> g neutralino is significant. Thus there are significantly fewer\nb-jets. We find a lower bound on the gluino mass in our models with M_{gluino}\n> 1000 GeV. Finally, there is a theoretical upper bound on the gluino mass\nwhich increases with the value of m_{16}. For m_{16} <= 30 TeV, the gluino mass\nsatisfies M_{gluino} <= 2.8 TeV at 90% CL. Thus, unless we further increase the\namount of fine-tuning, we expect gluinos to be discovered at LHC 14.\n"]}]

Conceived to provide unique research\npossibilities for particle physics, for condensed matter physics, chemistry and\nmaterial science, for structural biology and industrial applications, IRIDE\nwill open completely new research possibilities and advance our knowledge in\nmany branches of science and technology. IRIDE will contribute to open new\navenues of discoveries and to address most important riddles: What does matter\nconsist of? What is the structure of proteins that have a fundamental role in\nlife processes? What can we learn from protein structure to improve the\ntreatment of diseases and to design more efficient drugs? But also how does an\nelectronic chip behave under the effect of radiations? How can the heat flow in\na large heat exchanger be optimized? The scientific potential of IRIDE is far\nreaching and justifies the construction of such a large facility in Italy in\nsynergy with the national research institutes and companies and in the\nframework of the European and international research. It will impact also on\nR&D work for ILC, FEL, and will be complementarity to other large scale\naccelerator projects.

These solutions are specified by their mass and two\nspins. There are \"overlapping\" regions of this parameter space where one has\nextremal rings and holes of the same spins.

For special places of this overlapping region where one of the spins\ntends to zero, the entropies of the extremal ring and hole also tend to zero\nand essentially become equal. In this case we are dealing with Extremal\nVanishing Horizon (EVH) black holes or rings.

For mixed type\nthe proof requires the Ram-Yip formula for the nonsymmetric Koornwinder\npolynomials. A quantum alcove path formula is also given for the limit at t\nequal to infinity. As a consequence we establish the positivity of the\ncoefficients of nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials under this limit, as\nconjectured by Cherednik and the first author. Finally, an explicit formula is\ngiven at q equal to infinity, which yields the p-adic Iwahori-Whittaker\nfunctions of Brubaker, Bump, and Licata.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 3 figures"]}]

We argue that these phenomena could possibly be\ndetected by the Voyager spacecraft approaching and crossing the HP. These\nresults could clarify the concepts of the \"magnetic highway\" and the\n\"heliosheath depletion region\" recently proposed to explain recent Voyager 1\nobservations.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures"]}]

It is shown that, over a wide range of frequencies,\nelectromagnetic radiation can propagate largely unabsorbed from the present\nepoch into the recollapsing phase, confirming and demonstrating the generality\nof results of Davies and Twamley. As a consequence, time symmetric boundary\nconditions imply that the optical EGBR is at least twice that due to the\ngalaxies on our past light cone, and possibly considerably more. It is\ntherefore possible to test experimentally the notion that if our universe is\nclosed, it may be in a certain sense time symmetric. The lower bound on the\n\"excess\" EGBR in a time symmetric universe is consistent with present\nobservations. Nevertheless, better observations and modelling may soon rule it\nout entirely.
