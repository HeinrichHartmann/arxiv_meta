It appeared\nimportant to get a precise knowledge of these scan parameters' normal values\nduring the first trimester. This paper focused on crown-rump length. ---\nMETHODS --- 402 pregnancies from in-vitro fertilization allowing a precise\nestimation of foetal ages (FA) were used to determine the best model that\ndescribes crown-rump length (CRL) as a function of FA. Scan measures by a\nsingle operator from 3846 spontaneous pregnancies representative of the general\npopulation from Northern France were used to build a mathematical model linking\nFA and CRL in a context as close as possible to normal scan screening used in\nDown's syndrome likelihood determination. We modeled both CRL as a function of\nFA and FA as a function of CRL. For this, we used a clear methodology and\nperformed regressions with heteroskedastic corrections and robust regressions.\nThe results were compared by cross-validation to retain the equations with the\nbest predictive power. We also studied the errors between observed and\npredicted values. --- Results --- Data from 513 spontaneous pregnancies allowed\nto model CRL as a function of age of foetal age. The best model was a\npolynomial of degree 2. Datation with our equation that models spontaneous\npregnancies from a general population was in quite agreement with objective\ndatations obtained from 402 IVF pregnancies and thus support the validity of\nour model. The most precise measure of CRL was when the SD was minimal\n(1.83mm), for a CRL of 23.6 mm where our model predicted a 49.4 days of foetal\nage. Our study allowed to model the SD from 30 to 90 days of foetal age and\noffers the opportunity of using Zscores in the future to detect growth\nabnormalities. --- Conclusion --- With powerful statistical tools we report a\ngood modeling of the first trimester embryonic growth in the general population\nallowing a better knowledge of the date of fertilization useful in the\nultrasound screening of Down's syndrome. The optimal period to measure CRL and\npredict foetal age was 49.4 days (9 weeks of gestational age).

In the\nemergence of order out of self-organization we find similarities between\nbiological systems, as bird flocks, and some physical systems, as ferromagnets.\nIn both cases, the tendency of individuals to align to their neighbours gives\nrise to a polarized state. There is, however, one crucial difference: the\ninteraction network within an animal group is not necessarily fixed in time, as\neach individual moves and may change its neighbours. Therefore, the dynamical\ninteraction mechanism in biological and physical system can be quite different,\nnot only due to the gross disparity in the complexity of the individual\nentities, but also because of the potential role of inter-individual motion. To\nassess the relevance of this mechanism it is necessary to gain quantitative\nexperimental information about how much individuals move with respect to each\nother within the group. Here, by using data from field observations on\nstarlings, we study the diffusion properties of individual birds within a flock\nand investigate the effect of diffusion on the dynamics of the interaction\nnetwork. We find that birds diffuse faster than Brownian particles\n(superdiffusion) and in a strongly anisotropic way.

Finally, we\nstudy the diffusion properties of birds at the border of the flock.

We also find that the difference\nstrongly depends on the loading modes, chirality and width of the graphene\nnanoribbons, and it increases with decreasing width of the nanoribbons under\npure bending condition. The maximum difference of the predicted mechanical\nproperties using the two models can exceed 300% in different loading modes.\nComparing the two models with the MD results of AIREBO potential, we find that\nthe stick-spiral model overestimates and the beam model underestimates the\nmechanical properties in narrow armchair graphene nanoribbons under pure\nbending condition.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 21 figures"]}]

Although it is not known if the flow in the outer\njets of FRII sources also slows to this speed it is suggested that the\nexplanation of the L-G effect is likely to be the same in both types. This\nargument is strengthened by the recent evidence that FRII galaxies have very\nlarge viewing angles, which in turn implies that the L-G model cannot work\nregardless of the jet velocity. It may therefore be too soon to completely rule\nout internal depolarization in the lobes as the true explanation for the L-G\neffect.\n","Comment: 8 pages with 4 figures.

The last observation was performed\non 2011 November 12, about 100 days after the onset of the bursting activity\nthat had led to the discovery of the source on 2011 August 07. This long time\nspan enabled us to refine the rotational ephemeris and observe a downturn in\nthe decay of the X-ray flux. Assuming a broken power law for the long-term\nlight curve, the break was at ~46 d after the outburst onset, when the decay\nindex changed from alpha ~ 0.4 to ~4.5. The flux decreased by a factor ~2 in\nthe first ~50 d and then by a factor ~40 until November 2011 (overall, by a\nfactor ~70 in ~100 d). At the same time, the spectrum, which was well described\nby an absorbed blackbody all along the outburst, softened, the temperature\ndropping from ~1 to ~0.6 keV. Diffuse X-ray emission extending up to 20\" from\nthe source was clearly detected in all Chandra observations. Its spatial and\nspectral properties, as well as its time evolution, are consistent with a\ndust-scattering halo due to a single cloud located at a distance of\n$\\approx$200 pc from Swift J1834.9-0846, which should be in turn located at a\ndistance of ~5 kpc. Considering the time delay of the scattered photons, the\nsame dust cloud might also be responsible for the more extended emission\ndetected in XMM-Newton data taken in September 2011. We searched for the radio\nsignature of Swift J1834.9-0846 at radio frequencies using the Green Bank Radio\nTelescope and in archival data collected at Parkes from 1998 to 2003.

One interesting observed phenomenon is\noscillations in filaments, activated by distant flares and the large-scale\nwaves they produce. Characteristics of these oscillations, such as periods,\namplitudes, and lifetimes, can provide unique information about the filament.\nWe measure oscillation properties in flares and filaments from H-alpha\nchromospheric data using a new method that provides important spatial and\nfrequency content of the dynamics. We apply the method to two flare events\nwhere filaments are observed to oscillate and determine their properties. We\nfind strong oscillatory signal in flaring active regions in the chromosphere\nover a range of frequencies. Two filaments are found to oscillate without any\ndetectable chromospheric wave acting as an activation mechanism. We find that\nfilaments oscillate with periods of tens of minutes, but variations are\nsignificant at small spatial scales along the filamentary region. The results\nsuggest there is a frequency dependence of the oscillation amplitude, as well\nas a spatial dependence along single filaments that is more difficult to\nquantify. It also appears that the strength of the oscillations do not\nnecessarily depend on the strength of the trigger, although there are other\npossible effects that make this conclusion preliminary. Applications of this\ntechnique to other events and different data sets will provide important new\ninsights into the local energy densities and magnetic fields associated with\ndynamic chromospheric structures.\n","Comment: Accepted by Astrophysical Journal.

We analyze robustness to uncertainty of consensus in\nempirical data from multiple starling flocks and show that the flock\ninteraction networks with six or seven neighbors optimize the trade-off between\ngroup cohesion and individual effort. We can distinguish these numbers of\nneighbors from fewer or greater numbers using our systems-theoretic approach to\nmeasuring robustness of interaction networks as a function of the network\nstructure, i.e., who is sensing whom. The metric quantifies the disagreement\nwithin the network due to disturbances and noise during consensus behavior and\ncan be evaluated over a parameterized family of hypothesized sensing strategies\n(here the parameter is number of neighbors). We use this approach to further\nshow that for the range of flocks studied the optimal number of neighbors does\nnot depend on the number of birds within a flock; rather, it depends on the\nshape, notably the thickness, of the flock. The results suggest that robustness\nto uncertainty may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking for\nstarlings. More generally, our results elucidate the role of the interaction\nnetwork on uncertainty management in collective behavior, and motivate the\napplication of our approach to other biological networks.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 3 figures, 9 supporting figures"]}]
