This phenomenon is known as\nquantum criticality and leads to fascinating responses in thermodynamics and\ntransport of the compound. In the standard picture, a single quantum critical\npoint occurs at zero temperature, which results in a nontrivial critical\nbehaviour in its vicinity. Here we show that in two dimensions the scenario is\nconsiderably more complex due to the enormous amount of quantum fluctuations.\nInstead of the single point separating the antiferromagnet from the normal\nmetal, we have discovered a broad region between these two phases where the\nmagnetic order is destroyed but certain areas of the Fermi surface are closed\nby a large gap. This gap reflects the formation of a novel quantum state\ncharacterised by a superposition of d-wave superconductivity and a\nquadrupole-density wave, id est a state in which an electron quadrupole density\nspatially oscillates with a period drastically different from the one of the\noriginal spin-density wave. At moderate temperatures both orders co-exist at\nshort distances but thermal fluctuations destroy the long-range order. Below a\ncritical temperature the fluctuations are less essential and superconductivity\nbecomes stable. This new phenomenon may shed some light on the origin of the\nmysterious pseudogap state and of the high-temperature transition into the\nsuperconducting state in cuprates.

Once a privacy model has been selected, the goal is to enforce it\nwhile preserving as much data utility as possible. The main objective of this\nthesis is to improve the data utility in k-anonymous and differentially private\ndata releases. k-Anonymity has several drawbacks. On the disclosure limitation\nside, there is a lack of protection against attribute disclosure and against\ninformed intruders. On the data utility side, dealing with a large number of\nquasi-identifier attributes is problematic.

We describe a tailored experimental system\nused to produce and study Rydberg-interacting atoms excited from dense\nultracold atomic gases. The experiment has been optimized for fast duty cycles\nusing a high flux cold atom source and a three beam optical dipole trap. The\nlatter enables tuning of the atomic density and temperature over several orders\nof magnitude, all the way to the Bose-Einstein condensation transition. An\nelectrode structure surrounding the atoms allows for precise control over\nelectric fields and single-particle sensitive field ionization detection of\nRydberg atoms. We review two experiments which highlight the influence of\nstrong Rydberg--Rydberg interactions on different many-body systems. First, the\nRydberg blockade effect is used to pre-structure an atomic gas prior to its\nspontaneous evolution into an ultracold plasma. Second, hybrid states of\nphotons and atoms called dark-state polaritons are studied. By looking at the\nstatistical distribution of Rydberg excited atoms we reveal correlations\nbetween dark-state polaritons. These experiments will ultimately provide a\ndeeper understanding of many-body phenomena in strongly-interacting regimes,\nincluding the study of strongly-coupled plasmas and interfaces between atoms\nand light at the quantum level.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures; submitted to a special issue of 'Frontiers of\n  Physics' dedicated to 'Quantum Foundation and Technology: Frontiers and\n  Future'"]}]
