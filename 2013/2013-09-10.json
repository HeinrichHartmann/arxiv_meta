First, we describe numerical methods for the acceleration of the\nconvergence of series. These provide a useful toolbox for theoretical physics\nwhich has hitherto not received the attention it actually deserves. The\nunifying concept for convergence acceleration methods is that in many cases,\none can reach much faster convergence than by adding a particular series term\nby term. In some cases, it is even possible to use a divergent input series,\ntogether with a suitable sequence transformation, for the construction of\nnumerical methods that can be applied to the calculation of special functions.\nThis review both aims to provide some practical guidance as well as a\ngroundwork for the study of specialized literature. As a second topic, we\nreview some recent developments in the field of Borel resummation, which is\ngenerally recognized as one of the most versatile methods for the summation of\nfactorially divergent (perturbation) series. Here, the focus is on algorithms\nwhich make optimal use of all information contained in a finite set of\nperturbative coefficients. The unifying concept for the various aspects of the\nBorel method investigated here is given by the singularities of the Borel\ntransform, which introduce ambiguities from a mathematical point of view and\nlead to different possible physical interpretations. The two most important\ncases are: (i) the residues at the singularities correspond to the decay width\nof a resonance, and (ii) the presence of the singularities indicates the\nexistence of nonperturbative contributions which cannot be accounted for on the\nbasis of a Borel resummation and require generalizations toward resurgent\nexpansions. Both of these cases are illustrated by examples.\n","Comment: 119 pages, LaTeX"]}]

Solutions to these equations are called monopoles. Under some\nsimple topological assumptions, we show that the solution space of all\nmonopoles is a Banach manifold in suitable function space topologies. We then\nprove that the restriction of the space of monopoles to the boundary is a\nsubmersion onto a Lagrangian submanifold of the space of connections and\nspinors on the boundary. Both these spaces are infinite dimensional, even\nmodulo gauge, since no boundary conditions are specified for the Seiberg-Witten\nequations on the 3-manifold. We study the analytic properties of these monopole\nspaces with an eye towards developing a monopole Floer theory for 3-manifolds\nwith boundary, which we pursue in Part II.\n","Comment: Journal reference: Comm.

We have examined the strong magnetic fields generated by kinetic shear\n(Kelvin-Helmholtz) instabilities. Compared to the previous studies using\ncounter-streaming performed by Alves et al. (2012), the structure of KKHI of\nour jet-sheath configuration is slightly different even for the global\nevolution of the strong transverse magnetic field. In our simulations the major\ncomponents of growing modes are the electric field $E_{\\rm z}$ and the magnetic\nfield $B_{\\rm y}$. After the $B_{\\rm y}$ component is excited, an induced\nelectric field $E_{\\rm x}$ becomes significant. However, other field components\nremain small. We find that the structure and growth rate of KKHI with mass\nratios $m_{\\rm i}/m_{\\rm e} = 1836$ and $m_{\\rm i}/m_{\\rm e} = 20$ are similar.\nIn our simulations saturation in the nonlinear stage is not as clear as in\ncounter-streaming cases. The growth rate for a mildly-relativistic jet case\n($\\gamma_{\\rm j} = 1.5$) is larger than for a relativistic jet case\n($\\gamma_{\\rm j} = 15$).\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, presented at Dynamical processes in space plasmas\n  II, Isradinamic 2012, in press, ANGEO. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1303.2569"]}]

In this paper, the concept of stable $k$-error\nlinear complexity is proposed to study sequences with stable and large\n$k$-error linear complexity. In order to study k-error linear complexity of\nbinary sequences with period $2^n$, a new tool called cube theory is developed.\nBy using the cube theory, one can easily construct sequences with the maximum\nstable $k$-error linear complexity. For such purpose, we first prove that a\nbinary sequence with period $2^n$ can be decomposed into some disjoint cubes\nand further give a general decomposition approach. Second, it is proved that\nthe maximum $k$-error linear complexity is $2^n-(2^l-1)$ over all\n$2^n$-periodic binary sequences, where $2^{l-1}\\le k<2^{l}$. Thirdly, a\ncharacterization is presented about the $t$th ($t>1$) decrease in the $k$-error\nlinear complexity for a $2^n$-periodic binary sequence $s$ and this is a\ncontinuation of Kurosawa et al. recent work for the first decrease of k-error\nlinear complexity.

How the type 1/type 2 choice is made remains\na fundamental problem in the biology of apoptosis and has implications for\napoptosis related diseases and therapy. We study the problem of type 1/type 2\nchoice in silico utilizing a kinetic Monte Carlo model of cell death signaling.\nOur results show that the type 1/type 2 choice is linked to deterministic\nversus stochastic cell death activation, elucidating a unique regulatory\ncontrol of the apoptotic pathways. Consistent with previous findings, our\nresults indicate that caspase 8 activation level is a key regulator of the\nchoice between deterministic type 1 and stochastic type 2 pathways,\nirrespective of cell types. Expression levels of signaling molecules downstream\nalso regulate the type 1/type 2 choice. A simplified model of DISC clustering\nelucidates the mechanism of increased active caspase 8 generation, and type 1\nactivation, in cancer cells having increased sensitivity to death receptor\nactivation. We demonstrate that rapid deterministic activation of the type 1\npathway can selectively target those cancer cells, especially if XIAP is also\ninhibited; while inherent cell-to-cell variability would allow normal cells\nstay protected.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 15 figures"]}]

Acceleration efficiency is\nincreased by entrapment through self-generated waves, which is highly dependent\non the amount of accelerated particles. This, in turn, is determined by the\nefficiency of particle injection into the acceleration process.\n  Aims: We present an analysis of the injection efficiency at coronal shocks of\nvarying obliquity. We assessed injection through reflection and downstream\nscattering, including the effect of a cross-shock potential. Both quasi-thermal\nand suprathermal seed populations were analysed. We present results on the\neffect of cross-field diffusion downstream of the shock on the injection\nefficiency.\n  Methods: Using analytical methods, we present applicable injection speed\nthresholds that were compared with both semi-analytical flux integration and\nMonte Carlo simulations, which do not resort to binary thresholds. Shock-normal\nangle and shock-normal velocity were varied to assess the injection efficiency\nwith respect to these parameters.\n  Results: We present evidence of a significant bias of thermal seed particle\ninjection at small shock-normal angles. We show that downstream isotropisation\nmethods affect the theta-dependence of this result. We show a non-negligible\neffect caused by the cross-shock potential, and that the effect of downstream\ncross-field diffusion is highly dependent on boundary definitions.\n  Conclusions: Our results show that for Monte Carlo simulations of coronal\nshock acceleration a full distribution function assessment with downstream\nisotropisation through scatterings is necessary to realistically model particle\ninjection. Based on our results, seed particle injection at quasi-parallel\ncoronal shocks can result in significant acceleration efficiency, especially\nwhen combined with varying field-line geometry.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, 3 Appendices.

This new platform presents a flexible\narchitecture that enables fast/automatic system adaptive behaviour without\nhuman intervention. The concept is based on contactless technology, using\nartificial vision and laser scanning to identify and characterize different\nworkpieces travelling on a conveyor. Using laser triangulation, the workpieces\nare virtually reconstructed through a simplified cloud of three-dimensional\n(3D) points. From those reconstructed models, several algorithms are\nimplemented to extract information about workpieces profile (pattern\nrecognition), size, boundary and pose.

This is a low-cost and fully autonomous system\nthat allows adapting the robots behaviour to different manufacturing\nsituations. It means that the robot is ready to work over any piece at any\ntime, and thus, small production series can be reduced to as much as a\none-object series. No skilled workers and large setup times are needed to\noperate it.
