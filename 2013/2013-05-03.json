However, classical\nanalytical techniques are poorly suited to quantitative genetic studies of gene\nexpression where the number of traits assayed per individual can reach many\nthousand. Here, we derive a Bayesian genetic sparse factor model for estimating\nthe genetic covariance matrix (G-matrix) of high-dimensional traits, such as\ngene expression, in a mixed effects model. The key idea of our model is that we\nneed only consider G-matrices that are biologically plausible.

The advantages of this approach\nare two-fold. First, sparse factors are interpretable and provide biological\ninsight into mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture.

In\nthis work, we perform a comparative analysis of the syntactic and semantic\napproaches used to describe WS, from a complex network perspective. First, we\nextract syntactic and semantic WS dependency networks from a collection of\npublicly available WS descriptions. Then, we take advantage of tools from the\ncomplex network field to analyze them and determine their topological\nproperties. We show WS dependency networks exhibit some of the typical\ncharacteristics observed in real-world networks, such as small world and scale\nfree properties, as well as community structure. By comparing syntactic and\nsemantic networks through their topological properties, we show the\nintroduction of semantics in WS description allows modeling more accurately the\ndependencies between parameters, which in turn could lead to improved\ncomposition mining methods.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1305.0191"]}]

The evidence for\nthis claim involves the presence of a gapped state that lacks any identifiable\norder. This argument relies on being able to distinguish small order from no\norder which is notoriously difficult.

The primary result of this work explores how 10+ years of\nsimulated wear on a VIRUS fiber bundle affects both transmission and focal\nratio degradation (FRD) of the optical fibers. During the accelerated lifetime\ntests we continuously monitored the fibers for signs of FRD. We find that\ntransient FRD events were common during the portions of the tests when motion\nwas at telescope slew rates, but dropped to negligible levels during rates of\nmotion typical for science observation. Tests of fiber transmission and FRD\nconducted both before and after the lifetime tests reveal that while\ntransmission values do not change over the 10+ years of simulated wear, a clear\nincrease in FRD is seen in all 18 fibers tested. This increase in FRD is likely\ndue to microfractures that develop over time from repeated flexure of the fiber\nbundle, and stands in contrast to the transient FRD events that stem from\nlocalized stress and subsequent modal diffusion of light within the fibers.\nThere was no measurable wavelength dependence on the increase in FRD over 350\nnm to 600 nm.

Lastly, we give details of a degradation seen in the\nfiber bundle currently deployed on the Mitchell Spectrograph (formally VIRUS-P)\nat McDonald Observatory.

In particular, the existence of\nhubs, those vertices with a large number of connections, explodes the search\nspace, making the shortest path computation surprisingly challenging. In this\npaper, we introduce a set of novel techniques centered around hubs,\ncollectively referred to as the Hub-Accelerator framework, to compute the\nk-degree shortest path (finding the shortest path between two vertices if their\ndistance is within k). These techniques enable us to significantly reduce the\nsearch space by either greatly limiting the expansion scope of hubs (using the\nnovel distance- preserving Hub-Network concept) or completely pruning away the\nhubs in the online search (using the Hub2-Labeling approach).

It is a key detector for the\nmeasurement of hadrons, jets, tau leptons and missing transverse energy. The\nTileCal calibration system comprises radioactive source, laser and charge\ninjection elements and it allows to monitor and equalize the calorimeter\nresponse at each stage of the signal production, from scintillation light to\ndigitization. This contribution presents a brief description of the different\nTileCal calibration systems as well as the latest results on their performance\nin terms of calibration factors, linearity and stability. The performance of\nthe Tile Calorimeter with the cosmic muons and collision data is also\npresented, including the absolute energy scale, time resolution and associated\nstabilities.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 7 figures, LISHEP 2013, 17-24 March 2013, Rio de Janeiro"]}]

Our results show that\nthe Kondo peak splitting depends on the gate potential applied to the quantum\ndot and on the topology of the system. A common fact of any geometry is that\nthe differential susceptibility shows a strong non linear behavior. It was\nshown that there exist a critical field above which the Kondo resonance is\nsplitted out. This critical field rapidly diminishes when the gate potential is\nlowered, as a consequence of the reduction of the Kondo temperature and a\nsubsequent strong enhancement in the differential susceptibility occurring at\nlow fields. The critical field is also strong depedent on the topology of the\ncircuit. Above this critical field the Zeeman splitting depends linearly upon\nthe magnetic field and does not extrapolate to zero at zero field. The\nmagnitude of the Y-intercept coordinate depends on the gate potential but the\nslope of this function is not renormalized being independent of the value of\nthe gate potential. Our results are in agreement with very recent experiments.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, submited to PRB"]}]
