This mixing has the important qualitative effect of\nbreaking particle-hole symmetry as well as renormalizing the strength of the\ninterparticle interactions. Both effects could have important consequences for\nthe prospect that the fractional quantum Hall effect at $\\nu=5/2$ is described\nby states that support non-Abelian excitations such as the Moore-Read Pfaffian\nor anti-Pfaffian states. For GaAs, Landau level and subband mixing break\nparticle-hole symmetry in all Landau levels and subband mixing, due to finite\nthickness, causes additional short-distance softening of the Coulomb\ninteraction, further renormalizing the Hamiltonian; additionally, the Landau\nlevel and subband energy spacings are comparable so it is crucial to consider\nboth effects simultaneously. We find that in graphene, Landau level mixing only\nbreaks particle-hole symmetry outside of the lowest Landau level ($N\\neq0$).\nLandau level mixing is likely to be especially important in graphene since the\nLandau level mixing parameter is independent of the external magnetic field and\nis of order one.

Searching for terrestrial planets in the HZ of\nnearby stars is the stated goal of ongoing and planned extrasolar planet\nsurveys. Previous estimates of the inner edge of the HZ were based on\none-dimensional radiative-convective models. The most serious limitation of\nthese models is the inability to predict cloud behavior.

This dramatically expands the HZ\nand roughly doubles the frequency of habitable planets orbiting red dwarf\nstars. At high stellar flux, strong convection produces thick water clouds near\nthe substellar location that greatly increase the planetary albedo and reduce\nsurface temperatures. Higher insolation produces stronger substellar convection\nand therefore higher albedo, making this phenomenon a stabilizing climate\nfeedback. Substellar clouds also effectively block outgoing radiation from the\nsurface, reducing or even completely reversing the thermal emission contrast\nbetween dayside and nightside.

These states are\nseparated by first-order phase transitions between them. In both gas and liquid\nphases the complete translational and rotational symmetry exist, whereas in a\nsolid phase both symmetries are broken. In intermediate phases between liquid\nand solid, which include liquid crystal and plastic crystal phases, only one of\nthe two symmetries is preserved.

We argue that it is crucial for a\nbetter understanding of liquid to recognize that a liquid generally has a\ntendency to have local structural order and its presence is intrinsic and\nuniversal to any liquid. Such structural ordering is a consequence of many body\ncorrelations, more specifically, bond angle correlations, which we believe are\ncrucial for the description of the liquid state. We show that this physical\npicture may naturally explain difficult unsolved problems associated with the\nliquid state, such as anomalies of water-type liquids (water, Si, Ge, ...),\nliquid-liquid transition, liquid-glass transition, crystallization and\nquasicrystal formation, in a unified manner. In other words, we need a new\norder parameter representing low local free-energy configuration, which is bond\norientational order parameter in many cases, in addition to density order\nparameter for the physical description of these phenomena. Here we review our\ntwo-order-parameter model of liquid and consider how transient local structural\nordering is linked to all of the above-mentioned phenomena. The relationship\nbetween these phenomena are also discussed.\n","Comment: Colloquium paper, 85 pages, 62 figures"]}]

At the moment the possible existence of dark radiation is\nan unsolved question.

It is\nhence customary to assume the existence of an underlying dark matter component\nwith density fluctuations, $\\Delta(M)$, having amplitudes much larger than what\nCMB observations imply for the baryons. This is in fact one of the recurrent\narguments used in support of the dark matter hypothesis. In this letter we\nprove that the same extended theory of gravity which has been recently shown to\naccurately reproduce gravitational lensing observations, in absence of any dark\nmatter, and which in the low velocity regime converges to a MONDian force law,\nimplies a sufficiently amplified self-gravity to allow purely baryonic\nfluctuations with amplitudes in accordance with CMB constraints to naturally\ngrow into the $z=0$ astrophysical structures detected. The linear structure\nformation scenario which emerges closely resembles the standard concordance\ncosmology one, as abundantly calibrated over the last decade to match multiple\nobservational constraints at various redshifts. However, in contrast with what\noccurs in the concordance cosmology, this follows not from a critical\ndependence on initial conditions and the fine tuning of model parameters, but\nfrom the rapid convergence of highly arbitrary initial conditions onto a well\ndefined $\\Delta(M,z)$ attractor solution.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We propose\na distributed online data classification framework where data is gathered by\ndistributed data sources and processed by a heterogeneous set of distributed\nlearners which learn online, at run-time, how to classify the different data\nstreams either by using their locally available classification functions or by\nhelping each other by classifying each other's data. Importantly, since the\ndata is gathered at different locations, sending the data to another learner to\nprocess incurs additional costs such as delays, and hence this will be only\nbeneficial if the benefits obtained from a better classification will exceed\nthe costs. We model the problem of joint classification by the distributed and\nheterogeneous learners from multiple data sources as a distributed contextual\nbandit problem where each data is characterized by a specific context. We\ndevelop a distributed online learning algorithm for which we can prove\nsublinear regret.

Local dynamo action has been proposed to explain the presence of\nthis flux. We sought to test whether the quiet Sun flux detected by Hinode is\ndue to a local or the global dynamo by studying long-term variations in the\npolarisation signals detectable at the disc centre of the quiet Sun between\nNovember 2006 and May 2012, with particular emphasis on weak signals in the\ninternetwork. The investigation focusses on line-integrated circular\npolarisation V_tot and linear polarisation LP_tot profiles obtained from the Fe\nI 6302.5 \\AA absorption line in Hinode SOT/SP. Both circular and linear\npolarisation signals show no overall variation in the fraction of selected\npixels from 2006 until 2012. There is also no variation in the magnetic flux in\nthis interval of time. The probability density functions (PDF) of the\nline-of-sight magnetic flux can be fitted with a power law from 1.17 x 10^17 Mx\nto 8.53 x 10^18 Mx with index \\alpha=-1.82 \\pm 0.02 in 2007. The variation of\n\\alpha 's across all years does not exceed a significance of 1\\sigma. Linearly\npolarised features are also fitted with a power law, with index \\alpha=-2.60\n\\pm 0.06 in 2007. Indices derived from linear polarisation PDFs of other years\nalso show no significant variation. Our results show that the ubiquitous\nhorizontal polarisation on the edges of bright granules seen by Hinode are\ninvariant during the minimum of cycle 23. This supports the notion that the\nweak circular and linear polarisation is primarily caused by an independent\nlocal dynamo.\n"]}]
