For n-player general-sum games, however, theoretical guarantees\nfor regret minimization are less understood. Nonetheless, Counterfactual Regret\nMinimization (CFR), a popular regret minimization algorithm for extensive-form\ngames, has generated winning three-player Texas Hold'em agents in the Annual\nComputer Poker Competition (ACPC).

As we\nare approaching another solar maximum later in 2013, it may be instructive to\nanalyse the effects of the past solar cycles on the orbiting satellites using\nthe archival data of space environment parameters as indicators. In this paper,\nwe compute the plasma drag on a model LEOS due to the atmospheric heating by\nCMEs and other solar events as a function of the solar parameters.

The clumps show, for the first time in a \"dense\ngas tracer\", a significant correlation between HCO+ line emission from cold\nmolecular gas and Br{\\gamma} line emission of associated nebulae. This\ncorrelation arises in the HCO+ line's brightness, not its linewidth. In\ncontrast, the correlation between the N2H+ line emission and Br{\\gamma} is weak\nor absent. The HCO+/N2H+ line ratio also varies widely from clump to clump:\nbright HCO+ emission tends to be more closely associated with Br{\\gamma}\nnebulosity, while bright N2H+ emission tends to avoid areas that are bright in\nBr{\\gamma}. Both molecular species show correlations of weak significance with\ninfrared H2 v=1-0 and v=2-1 line emission, in or near the clumps. The H2\nemission line ratio is consistent with fluorescent excitation in most of the\nclumps, although thermal excitation is seen in a few clumps. We interpret these\ntrends as evidence for evolution in the gas conditions due to the effects of\nongoing star formation in the clumps, in particular, the importance of UV\nradiation from massive YSOs as the driving agent that heats the molecular gas\nand alters its chemistry. This suggests that some traditional dense gas tracers\nof molecular clouds do not sample a homogeneous population of clumps, i.e.,\nthat the HCO+ brightness in particular is directly related to the heating and\ndisruption of cold gas by massive young stars, whereas the N2H+ better samples\ngas not yet affected by this process.
