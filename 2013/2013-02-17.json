The general\nexpression [max]\\_top(P_U,f(.),X=f(U,S))I(U;Y) is presented for the capacity of\nthis channel. For linear assignment to f(.), i.e. X=U-{\\beta}S, this expression\nleads to the compensation strategy proposed previously by Willems to obtain an\nachievable rate for the DTC. We show that linear assignment to f(.) is optimal,\nunder the condition that there exists a real number {\\beta}^* such that the\npair (X+{\\beta}^* S,U) is independent of interference S. Furthermore, by\napplying a time-sharing technique to the achievable rate derived by linear\nassignment to f(.), an improved lower bound on the capacity of DTC is obtained.\nWe also consider the Gaussian multiple access channel with additive\ninterference, and study two different scenarios for this system. In the first\ncase, both transmitters know interference causally while in the second, one\ntransmitter has access to the interference noncausally and the other causally.\nAchievable rate regions for these two scenarios are then established.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]
