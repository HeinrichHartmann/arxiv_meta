Furthermore, we examine frustration\neffect on both modes in the rung-singlet phase with a perturbation theory from\nthe strong coupling limit. It is shown that the anti-bonding mode is stable\nagainst the frustration, and a wavenumber with minimum excitation energy is\nshifted from the commensurate to incommensurate ones. On the other hand, the\nbonding mode is merged into the continuum excitation of multiple triplet\nexcitations by increasing the frustration. By comparing our results with\ninelastic neutron scattering experiments for BiCu$_2$PO$_6$, the magnitude of\nthe magnetic exchange interactions and the ground state will be determined.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Traditional duality based optimization techniques cannot be directly\napplied to this problem, because the non-strict concavity of the CoMP\ntransmission's achievable rate with respect to the transmission power induces\nthat the local power allocation subproblems have non-unique optimum solutions.\nWe propose a distributed power allocation algorithm to resolve this non-strict\nconcavity difficulty. This algorithm only requires local information exchange\namong neighboring base stations serving the same user, and is thus scalable as\nthe network size grows. The step-size parameters of this algorithm are\ndetermined by only local user access relationship (i.e., the number of users\nserved by each antenna), but do not rely on channel coefficients. Therefore,\nthe convergence speed of this algorithm is quite robust to different channel\nfading coefficients. We rigorously prove that this algorithm converges to an\noptimum solution of the power allocation problem. Simulation results are\npresented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation\nalgorithm.\n","Comment: 11 pages, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications"]}]

The resulting controllers\nare purely discrete and maintain an ongoing interaction with their environment\nby changing their internal state according to the inputs they receive from\nsensors or other robots.\n  Since SAR robots have to cooperate in order to complete the required tasks,\nthe synthesis of controllers that together achieve a common goal is considered.\nThis distributed synthesis problem is provably undecidable, hence it cannot be\nsolved in full generality, but a set of design principles is introduced in\norder to develop specialized synthesizable specifications. In particular,\ncommunication and cooperation are resolved by introducing a verified\nstandardized communication protocol and preempting negotiations between robots.\n  The robots move on a graph on which we consider the search for stationary and\nmoving targets. Searching for moving targets is cast into a game of cops and\nrobbers, and specifications implementing a winning strategy are developed so\nthat the number of robots required is minimized.\n  The viability of the methods is demonstrated by synthesizing controllers for\nrobots performing search and rescue for stationary targets and searching for\nmoving targets.

At high temperatures, random motion of\nthese vortices destroys large-scale coherence. At low temperatures, vortices\nwith opposite spin can pair together, cancelling their circulation and allowing\nquasi-long-range order to appear. This Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)\ntransition[3,4] is essentially classical, arising for example in the\ntraditional XY model for spins, but to date experimental evidence has been\nobtained only in cold quantum systems. Measurements of superfluid sound\nspeed[5] and critical velocity[6] have been consistent with scaling\npredictions, and vortices have been observed directly in cold atom\nexperiments[7,8]. However, the presence of trapping potentials restricts\nmeasurement to vortex density, rather than number, and obscures the process of\nvortex unbinding. Further, atom and fluid experiments suffer from parasitic\nheating and difficulties in phase recording, leading to results that differ\nfrom theory in many quantitative aspects. Here, we use a nonlinear optical\nsystem to directly observe the ideal BKT transition, including vortex pair\ndynamics and the correlation properties of the wavefunction, for both repulsive\nand attractiveinteractions (the photonic equivalent of ferromagnetic and\nantiferromagnetic conditions[9]). The results confirm the thermodynamics of the\nBKT transition and expose outstanding issues in the crossovers to superfluidity\nand Bose-Einstein condensation.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures"]}]
