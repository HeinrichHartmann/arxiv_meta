One\npromising potential implementation is to use superconducting quantum bits in\nthe circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) architecture. There, the low energy\nstates of a nonlinear electronic oscillator are isolated and addressed as a\nqubit. These qubits are capacitively coupled to the modes of a\nmicrowave-frequency transmission line resonator which serves as a quantum\ncommunication bus. Microwave electrical pulses are applied to the resonator to\nmanipulate or measure the qubit state. State control is calibrated using\ndiagnostic sequences that expose systematic errors. Hybridization of the\nresonator with the qubit gives it a nonlinear response when driven strongly,\nuseful for amplifying the measurement signal to enhance accuracy. Qubits\ncoupled to the same bus may coherently interact with one another via the\nexchange of virtual photons. A two-qubit conditional phase gate mediated by\nthis interaction can deterministically entangle its targets, and is used to\ngenerate two-qubit Bell states and three-qubit GHZ states. These three-qubit\nstates are of particular interest because they redundantly encode quantum\ninformation. They are the basis of the quantum repetition code prototypical of\nmore sophisticated schemes required for quantum computation. Using a\nthree-qubit Toffoli gate, this code is demonstrated to autonomously correct\neither bit- or phase-flip errors. Despite observing the expected behavior, the\noverall fidelity is low because of decoherence. A superior implementation of\ncQED replaces the transmission-line resonator with a three-dimensional box\nmode, increasing lifetimes by an order of magnitude. In-situ qubit frequency\ncontrol is enabled with control lines, which are used to fully characterize and\ncontrol the system Hamiltonian.\n","Comment: Ph.D. thesis. 368 pages, 107 figures.
