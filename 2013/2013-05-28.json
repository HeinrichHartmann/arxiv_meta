Within\nquasiclassical approach we calculate self-consistently the order parameter\ndistributions and electronic local density of states (LDOS) profiles. In the\nclean case we find the low temperature vortex core anomaly predicted\nanalytically in G.E. Volovik, JETP Lett. {\\bf 58}, 455 (1993) and obtain the\ninterference patterns in LDOS distributions analogous to found previously in\nthe framework of Bogolubov-de Gennes theory. In dirty regime the multiquantum\nvortices feature a peculiar plateau in the zero-energy LDOS profile which can\nbe considered as an experimental hallmark of multiquantum vortex formation in\nmesoscopic superconductors.\n","Comment: new figures added in this version"]}]

In this letter we\npropose to estimate heritability of disease directly by regression of phenotype\nsimilarities on genotype correlations, corrected to account for ascertainment.\nWe refer to this method as genetic correlation regression (GCR). Using GCR we\nestimate the heritability of Crohn's disease at 34% using the same data. We\ndemonstrate through extensive simulation that our method yields unbiased\nheritability estimates, which are consistently higher than LMM estimates.\nMoreover, we develop a heuristic correction to LMM estimates, which can be\napplied to published LMM results. Applying our heuristic correction increases\nthe estimated heritability of multiple sclerosis from 30% to 52.6%.\n","Comment: main text: 30 pages, 4 figures.

This exploration task is formalized by Low,\nDolan, and Khosla (2008) in a sequential decision-theoretic planning under\nuncertainty framework called MASP. The time complexity of solving MASP\napproximately depends on the map resolution, which limits its use in\nlarge-scale, high-resolution exploration and mapping. To alleviate this\ncomputational difficulty, this paper presents an information-theoretic approach\nto MASP (iMASP) for efficient adaptive path planning; by reformulating the\ncost-minimizing iMASP as a reward-maximizing problem, its time complexity\nbecomes independent of map resolution and is less sensitive to increasing robot\nteam size as demonstrated both theoretically and empirically. Using the\nreward-maximizing dual, we derive a novel adaptive variant of maximum entropy\nsampling, thus improving the induced exploration policy performance. It also\nallows us to establish theoretical bounds quantifying the performance advantage\nof optimal adaptive over non-adaptive policies and the performance quality of\napproximately optimal vs. optimal adaptive policies. We show analytically and\nempirically the superior performance of iMASP-based policies for sampling the\nlog-Gaussian process to that of policies for the widely-used Gaussian process\nin mapping the hotspot field.
