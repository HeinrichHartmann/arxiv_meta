GWAS entails the solution of up to trillions ($10^{12}$) of correlated\ngeneralized least-squares problems, posing a daunting challenge: the\nperformance of petaflops ($10^{15}$ floating-point operations) over terabytes\nof data.\n  In this paper, we design an algorithm for performing GWAS on multi-core\narchitectures.

For this purpose, we use three\ndifferent morphologies for the satellites: pure disc, pure bulge and a mixture\nbulge+disc. Two morphologies are used for the host galaxies: bulge+disc and\npure bulge. We find that while the spheroidal stellar component experiences a\nconstant power-law like mass removal, the disc is exposed to an exponential\nmass loss when the tidal radius of the satellite is of the same order of the\ndisc scale length. This dramatic mass loss is able to completely remove the\nstellar component on time scale of 100 Myears. As a consequence two satellites\nwith the same stellar and dark matter masses, on the same orbit could either\nretain considerable fraction of their stellar mass after 10 Gyrs or being\ncompletely destroyed, depending on their initial stellar morphology. We find\nthat there are two characteristic time scales describing the beginning and the\nend of the disc removal, whose values are related to the size of the disc.

Path recovery is accomplished\nusing a secondary ACL2 stobj implementing a LIFO stack, which is proven\ncorrect.

The position and valence state of the substituted H were determined by\nneutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations. The close\nsimilarity in the structural and electrical properties of CaFeAsH and CaFeAsF\nindicated the formation of the hydride ion (H-), which is isovalent with the\nfluoride ion (F-), in the 1111-type iron arsenides.

In order\nto avoid the erosive consequences of neutron emission, one studies the cold\nfission regions, corresponding to total kinetic energy (TE) close to the\nmaximum available energy of the reaction (Q). Contrary to expected, in cold\nfission is not observed high odd-even effect in mass number distribution.\nNevertheless, the measured values are compatible with higher odd-even effects\non proton or neutron number distribution, respectively. In addition, in cold\nfission, the minimal total excitation energy (X) is correlated with the Coulomb\nenergy excess, which is defined as the difference between C (the electrostatic\ninteraction energy between complementary fragments taken as spherical in\nscission configuration) and Q. These Coulomb effects increase with the\nasymmetry of the charge fragmentations. In sum, the experimental data on cold\nfission suggest that scission configurations explore all the possibilities\npermitted by the available energy for fission.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 17 figures"]}]

However, this approach cannot be directly applied to\nlayered networks where disjoint paths may not always exist.

First, we\nconsider the problem of finding the minimum number of survivable paths. In\nparticular, we focus on two versions of this problem: one where the length of a\npath is restricted, and the other where the number of paths sharing a fiber is\nrestricted. We prove that in general, finding the minimum survivable path set\nis NP-hard, whereas both of the restricted versions of the problem can be\nsolved in polynomial time. We formulate the problem as Integer Linear Programs\n(ILPs), and use these formulations to develop heuristics and approximation\nalgorithms. Next, we consider the problem of finding a set of survivable paths\nthat uses the minimum number of fibers. We show that this problem is NP-hard in\ngeneral, and develop heuristics and approximation algorithms with provable\napproximation bounds.

Such games have been used to model issues including the\nformation of opinions and the adoption of technology. A basic question that has\nremained largely open in this area is to consider games where the strategies\navailable to the players come from a fixed, discrete set, and where players may\nhave different intrinsic preferences among the possible strategies. It is\nnatural to model the tension among these different preferences by positing a\ndistance function on the strategy set that determines a notion of \"similarity\"\namong strategies; a player's payoff is determined by the distance from her\nchosen strategy to her preferred strategy and to the strategies chosen by her\nnetwork neighbors. Even when there are only two strategies available, this\nframework already leads to natural open questions about a version of the\nclassical Battle of the Sexes problem played on a graph.\n  We develop a set of techniques for analyzing this class of games, which we\nrefer to as discrete preference games. We parametrize the games by the relative\nextent to which a player takes into account the effect of her preferred\nstrategy and the effect of her neighbors' strategies, allowing us to\ninterpolate between network coordination games and unilateral decision-making.\nWhen these two effects are balanced, we show that the price of stability is\nequal to 1 for any discrete preference game in which the distance function on\nthe strategies is a tree metric; as a special case, this includes the Battle of\nthe Sexes on a graph. We also show that trees form the maximal family of\nmetrics for which the price of stability is 1, and produce a collection of\nmetrics on which the price of stability converges to a tight bound of 2.\n"]}]
