In the literature, a multi-range potential was devised to\nadjust the surface tension [Sbragaglia et al., Phys. Rev. E 75, 026702 (2007)].\nHowever, it was recently found that the density ratio of the system will be\nchanged when the multi-range potential is employed to adjust the surface\ntension. A new approach is therefore proposed in the present work. The basic\nstrategy is to add a source term to the LB equation so as to tune the surface\ntension of the pseudopotential LB model. The proposed approach can guarantee\nthat the adjustment of the surface tension does not affect the mechanical\nstability condition of the pseudopotential LB model, and thus provides a\nseparate control of the surface tension and the density ratio. Meanwhile, it\nstill retains the mesoscopic feature and the computational simplicity of the\npseudopotential LB model. Numerical simulations are carried out for stationary\ndroplets, capillary waves, and droplet splashing on a thin liquid film.

In the\nRandall-Sundrum model electroweak observables provide very strong bounds on the\nmass of KK modes which motivates extensions to overcome this problem. Two\nextensions are briefly discussed. One particular extension is based on the\ndeformation of the metric such that it strongly departs from the AdS_5\nstructure in the IR region while it goes asymptotically to AdS_5 in the UV\nbrane. This model has the IR brane close to a naked metric singularity (which\nis outside the physical interval) characteristic of soft-walls constructions.\nThe proximity of the singularity provides a strong wave-function\nrenormalization for the Higgs field which suppresses the T and S parameters.\nThe second class of considered extensions are based on the introduction of an\nextra gauge group in the bulk such that the custodial SU(2)_R symmetry is\ngauged and protects the T parameter. By further enlarging the bulk gauge\nsymmetry one can find models where the Higgs is identified with the fifth\ncomponent of gauge fields and for which the Higgs potential, along with the\nHiggs mass, can be dynamically determined by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 13 figures.

Yet programmers prefer to\ntreat concurrent code as if it were wait-free, guaranteeing that all operations\nalways make progress. Unfortunately, designing wait-free algorithms is\ngenerally a very complex task, and the resulting algorithms are not always\nefficient. While obtaining efficient wait-free algorithms has been a long-time\ngoal for the theory community, most non-blocking commercial code is only\nlock-free.\n  This paper suggests a simple solution to this problem. We show that, for a\nlarge class of lock- free algorithms, under scheduling conditions which\napproximate those found in commercial hardware architectures, lock-free\nalgorithms behave as if they are wait-free. In other words, programmers can\nkeep on designing simple lock-free algorithms instead of complex wait-free\nones, and in practice, they will get wait-free progress.\n  Our main contribution is a new way of analyzing a general class of lock-free\nalgorithms under a stochastic scheduler. Our analysis relates the individual\nperformance of processes with the global performance of the system using Markov\nchain lifting between a complex per-process chain and a simpler system progress\nchain. We show that lock-free algorithms are not only wait-free with\nprobability 1, but that in fact a general subset of lock-free algorithms can be\nclosely bounded in terms of the average number of steps required until an\noperation completes.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze progress\nconditions, typically stated in relation to a worst case adversary, in a\nstochastic model capturing their expected asymptotic behavior.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

SCE uses the special content copy indicator to\ncompute the estimate, while WCE derives the estimate based on meta-information\nin sampled vertices.

These eigenstates consist of independent localized magnons\nembedded in a ferromagnetic environment and become ground states in high\nmagnetic fields. For appropriate lattice distortions fitting to the structure\nof the localized magnons the lowering of magnetic energy can be calculated\nexactly and is proportional to the displacement of atoms leading to a\nspin-Peierls lattice instability. Since these localized states are present only\nfor high magnetic fields, this instability might be driven by magnetic field.\nThe hysteresis of the spin-Peierls transition is also discussed.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 1 figure, new version corresponds to that published in PRL"]}]
