By using threshold detectors and postselection,\none can only infer the entanglement of the initial pair of photons, so\nmicro-micro entanglement, as it is further confirmed by the violation of a\nnon-separability criterion for bipartite systems.

While initial efforts using\nmathematical or statistical modeling of read counts or per-base exonic signal\nhave been successful, they may suffer from model overfitting since not all the\nreference transcripts in a database are expressed under a specific biological\ncondition. Standard shrinkage approaches, such as Lasso, shrink all the\ntranscript abundances to zero in a non-discriminative manner. Thus it does not\nnecessarily yield the set of condition-specific transcripts.

Here, we study these equations in porous media whose\nelectric permittivities show a contrast compared to the electric permittivity\nof the electrolyte phase. Our main result is the derivation of convenient\nlow-dimensional equations, that is, of effective macroscopic porous media\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck equations, which reliably describe ionic transport. The\ncontrast in the electric permittivities between liquid and solid phase and the\nheterogeneity of the porous medium induce strongly oscillating electric\npotentials (fields). In order to account for this special physical scenario, we\nintroduce a modified asymptotic multiple-scale expansion which takes advantage\nof the nonlinearly coupled structure of the ionic transport equations. This\nallows for a systematic upscaling resulting in a new effective porous medium\nformulation which shows a new transport term on the macroscale. Solvability of\nall arising equations is rigorously verified. This emergence of a new transport\nterm indicates promising physical insights into the influence of the microscale\nmaterial properties on the macroscale. Hence, systematic upscaling strategies\nprovide a source and a prospective tool to capitalize intrinsic scale effects\nfor scientific, engineering, and industrial applications.\n"]}]

In the case of the solar\natmosphere the absorption processes with $A=$ H and $B=$ Mg and Si are treated\nas dominant ones, but the cases $A=$ H and $B=$ Al and $A=$ He and $B=$ H are\nalso taken into consideration. The choice of just these species is caused by\nthe fact that, of the species relevant for the used solar-atmosphere model, it\nwas only for them that we could determine the necessary characteristics of the\ncorresponding molecular ions, i.e. the molecular potential curves and dipole\nmatrix elements.

Computing with graphs handles the sharing of common\nsubexpressions in a natural and seamless way, and improves the efficiency of\ncomputations in space and time. Sharing is ubiquitous in several research\nareas, as witnessed by the modelling of first- and higher-order term rewriting\nby (acyclic or cyclic) graph rewriting, the modelling of biological or chemical\nabstract machines, and the implementation techniques of programming languages:\nmany implementations of functional, logic, object-oriented, concurrent and\nmobile calculi are based on term graphs. Term graphs are also used in automated\ntheorem proving and symbolic computation systems working on shared structures.\nThe aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working in different\ndomains on term and graph transformation and to foster their interaction, to\nprovide a forum for presenting new ideas and work in progress, and to enable\nnewcomers to learn about current activities in term graph rewriting.\n  These proceedings contain six accepted papers and the abstracts of two\ninvited talks.

In this paper,\nwe present a decomposition method for parallelization of multi-dimensional FFTs\nwith smallest communication amount for all ranges of the number of processes\ncompared to previously proposed methods. This is achieved by two distinguishing\nfeatures: adaptive decomposition and transpose order awareness. In the proposed\nmethod, the FFT data are decomposed based on a row-wise basis that maps the\nmulti-dimensional data into one-dimensional data, and translates the\ncorresponding coordinates from multi-dimensions into one-dimension so that the\nresultant one-dimensional data can be divided and allocated equally to the\nprocesses. As a result, differently from previous works that have the\ndimensions of decomposition pre-defined, our method can adaptively decompose\nthe FFT data on the lowest possible dimensions depending on the number of\nprocesses. In addition, this row-wise decomposition provides plenty of\nalternatives in data transpose, and different transpose order results in\ndifferent amount of communication. We identify the best transpose orders with\nsmallest communication amounts for the 3-D, 4-D, and 5-D FFTs by analyzing all\npossible cases.

For envelopes decaying as $|x|^{-\\alpha}$ at infinity,\nwe determine the number of bound states below a given energy $E<0$,\nasymptotically as $\\alpha\\downarrow 0$. To show that bound states located at\nthe bottom of the spectrum are related to the phenomenon of Anderson\nlocalization in the corresponding ergodic model, we prove: (a) these states are\nexponentially localized with a localization length that is uniform in the decay\nexponent $\\alpha$; (b)~ dynamical localization holds uniformly in $\\alpha$.\n"]}]

We show how a projective class leads to an Adams spectral sequence and\ngive some results on the convergence and collapsing of this spectral sequence.\nWe use this to study various ideals. In the stable homotopy category we examine\nphantom maps, skeletal phantom maps, superphantom maps, and ghosts. (A ghost is\na map which induces the zero map of homotopy groups.) We show that ghosts lead\nto a stable analogue of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space, and we\ncalculate this stable analogue for low-dimensional real projective spaces. We\nalso give a relation between ghosts and the Hopf and Kervaire invariant\nproblems. In the case of A-infinity modules over an A-infinity ring spectrum,\nthe ghost spectral sequence is a universal coefficient spectral sequence. From\nthe phantom projective class we derive a generalized Milnor sequence for\nfiltered diagrams of finite spectra, and from this it follows that the group of\nphantom maps from X to Y can always be described as a lim^1 group. The last two\nsections focus on algebraic examples. In the derived category of an abelian\ncategory we study the ideal of maps inducing the zero map of homology groups\nand find a natural setting for a result of Kelly on the vanishing of composites\nof such maps. We also explain how pure exact sequences relate to phantom maps\nin the derived category of a ring and give an example showing that phantoms can\ncompose non-trivially.\n","Comment: 55 pages.
