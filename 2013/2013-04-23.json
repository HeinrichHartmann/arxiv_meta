However, there are indications that the SM is only a good\napproximation to an underlying non-local reality involving fundamental entities\n(preons) that are not point particles. Furthermore, our universe seems to be\ndominated by a vacuum energy/cosmological constant. The holographic principle\nthen indicates only a finite number of bits of information will ever be\navailable to describe the observable universe, and that requires a holographic\npreon model linking the (0,1) holographic bits to SM particles. All SM\nparticles have charges 0, 1/3, 2/3 or 1 in units of the electron charge, so the\nbits in a holographic preon model must be identified with fractional electric\ncharge. Such holographic charged preon models require baryon asymmetry and also\nsuggest a mechanism for stationary action. This paper outlines a holographic\ncharged preon model where preons are strands with finite energy density\nspecified by bits of information identifying the charge on each end. In the\nmodel, SM particles consist of three strands with spin states corresponding to\nwrapped states of the strands. SM particles in this wrapped preon model can be\napproximated by preon bound states in non-local dynamics based on three-preon\nBethe-Salpeter equations with instantaneous three-preon interactions. The model\ncan be falsified by data from the Large Hadron Collider because it generates\nbaryon asymmetry without axions, and does not allow more than three generations\nof SM fermions.\n","Comment: 13 pages, two figures, minor corrections to accomodate a scalar boson"]}]

The goal of\nspectral gap amplification is to construct a Hamiltonian H' with the same\neigenstate as H but a bigger spectral gap, requiring that constant-time\nevolutions with H' and H are implemented with nearly the same cost. We show\nthat a quadratic spectral gap amplification is possible when H satisfies a\nfrustration-free property and give H' for these cases.

Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison of\nprotein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the protein\ndomain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the global\nstructure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.\nHowever, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive to\nthe choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficult\nproblem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.\n  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graph\nregularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph to\nregularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifold\nof protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for the\nregularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly and\nautomatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in an\niterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP\nprotein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking\nperformance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise\nsimilarity based ranking methods.\n  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph\nregularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining\nmultiple graphs. This aspect of generalization introduces a new frontier in\napplying multiple graphs to solving protein domain ranking applications.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

Our formalism facilitates an efficient approach to computing Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) anisotropies for cosmic strings.

Here we show that the degeneracy of the\ngenetic code is lifted by environmental perturbations to regulate protein\nlevels in living cells. By measuring protein synthesis rates from a synthetic\nreporter library in Escherichia coli, we find that environmental perturbations,\nsuch as reduction of cognate amino acid supply, lift the degeneracy of the\ngenetic code by splitting codon families into a hierarchy of robust and\nsensitive synonymous codons. Rates of protein synthesis associated with robust\ncodons are up to hundred-fold higher than those associated with sensitive\ncodons under these conditions. We find that the observed hierarchy between\nsynonymous codons is not determined by usual rules associated with tRNA\nabundance and codon usage. Rather, competition among tRNA isoacceptors for\naminoacylation underlies the robustness of protein synthesis. Remarkably, the\nhierarchy established using the synthetic library also explains the measured\nrobustness of synthesis for endogenous proteins in E. coli. We further found\nthat the same hierarchy is reflected in the fitness cost of synonymous\nmutations in amino acid biosynthesis genes and in the transcriptional control\nof sigma factor genes.

By direct calculation, the fermion sector is\nfound to consist of a massless chiral fermion and a massless gravitino. By\nanalyzing the supersymmetry transformations, we find that the chiral fermion\ntransforms inhomogeneously, indicating that the ghost condensate vacuum\nspontaneously breaks local supersymmetry with this field as the Goldstone\nfermion. Although potentially able to get a mass through the super-Higgs\neffect, the vanishing superpotential in the ghost condensate theory renders the\ngravitino massless. Thus local supersymmetry is broken without the super-Higgs\neffect taking place. This is in agreement with, and gives an explanation for,\nthe direct calculation.\n","Comment: 41 pages, v2: minor corrections to section IV.D, conclusions\n  unchanged"]}]

For large k the membrane remains flat though rippled in the radial\ndirection. Such membranes do not have negative Gaussian curvature and thus will\nnot likely spawn twisted ribbons.

It is intriguing that forbidden nuclear reflections\nof space group $I4_1/acd$ are also observed in a wide temperature range from 4\nK to 600 K, which suggests a reduced crystal structure symmetry. This\nneutron-scattering work provides a direct, well-refined experimental\ncharacterization of the magnetic and crystal structures that are crucial to the\nunderstanding of the unconventional magnetism exhibited in this unusual\nmagnetic insulator.\n","Comment: the version appeared in PRB"]}]

Such\ntransformations have wide applications: they can decrease computation time,\npower consumption, and memory usage, and can, in some cases, allow\nimplementations of incomputable operations. Correctness proofs of approximate\nprogram transformations are by definition quantitative. Unfortunately, unlike\nwith standard program transformations, there is as of yet no modular way to\nprove correctness of an approximate transformation itself. Error bounds must be\nproved for each transformed program individually, and must be re-proved each\ntime a program is modified or a different set of approximations are applied. In\nthis paper, we give a semantics that enables quantitative reasoning about a\nlarge class of approximate program transformations in a local, composable way.\nOur semantics is based on a notion of distance between programs that defines\nwhat it means for an approximate transformation to be correct up to an error\nbound. The key insight is that distances between programs cannot in general be\nformulated in terms of metric spaces and real numbers. Instead, our semantics\nadmits natural notions of distance for each type construct; for example,\nnumbers are used as distances for numerical data, functions are used as\ndistances for functional data, an polymorphic lambda-terms are used as\ndistances for polymorphic data. We then show how our semantics applies to two\nexample approximations: replacing reals with floating-point numbers, and loop\nperforation.\n"]}]

Flash memories\ncould soon reach their miniaturization limits mostly because reliably keeping\nenough electrons in an always smaller cell size will become increasingly\ndifficult . The control of electrical resistance at the nanometer scale\ntherefore requires new concepts, and the ultimate resistance-change device is\nbelieved to exploit a purely electronic phase change such as the Mott insulator\nto insulator transition [2]. Here we show that application of short electric\npulses allows to switch back and forth between an initial high-resistance\ninsulating state (\"0\" state) and a low-resistance \"metallic\" state (\"1\" state)\nin the whole class of Mott Insulator compounds AM4X8 (A = Ga, Ge; M= V, Nb, Ta;\nX = S, Se).

Indeed, they allow us to\nmodel the human reasoning in replacing words, assessments, preferences,\nchoices, wishes... by ad hoc variables, such as fuzzy sets or more\nsophisticated variables.\n  This paper focuses on a particular model: Herrera & Martinez' 2-tuple\nlinguistic model and their approach to deal with unbalanced linguistic term\nsets. It is interesting since the computations are accomplished without loss of\ninformation while the results of the decision-making processes always refer to\nthe initial linguistic term set. They propose a fuzzy partition which\ndistributes data on the axis by using linguistic hierarchies to manage the\nnon-uniformity. However, the required input (especially the density around the\nterms) taken by their fuzzy partition algorithm may be considered as too much\ndemanding in a real-world application, since density is not always easy to\ndetermine. Moreover, in some limit cases (especially when two terms are very\nclosed semantically to each other), the partition doesn't comply with the data\nthemselves, it isn't close to the reality. Therefore we propose to modify the\nrequired input, in order to offer a simpler and more faithful partition. We\nhave added an extension to the package jFuzzyLogic and to the corresponding\nscript language FCL. This extension supports both 2-tuple models: Herrera &\nMartinez' and ours. In addition to the partition algorithm, we present two\naggregation algorithms: the arithmetic means and the addition. We also discuss\nthese kinds of 2-tuple models.\n"]}]

The algorithm is designed for the class of of densely\nstochastic games; that is, games where one would rarely expect to sample the\nsame successor state multiple times at any particular chance node. Our approach\ncombines sparse sampling techniques from MDP planning with classic pruning\ntechniques developed for adversarial expectimax planning. We compare and\ncontrast our algorithm to the traditional *-Minimax approaches, as well as MCTS\nenhanced with the Double Progressive Widening, on four games: Pig, EinStein\nW\\\"urfelt Nicht!, Can't Stop, and Ra. Our results show that MCMS can be\ncompetitive with enhanced MCTS variants in some domains, while consistently\noutperforming the equivalent classic approaches given the same amount of\nthinking time.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

On the other hand, predictable program executions are\nthreatened if not impossible if no proper means of resource isolation and\nexclusive use may be established on demand. In view of these problems and\nmenaces, invasive computing enables an application programmer to claim for\nprocessing resources and spread computations to claimed processors dynamically\nat certain points of the program execution.\n  Such decisions may be depending on the degree of application parallelism and\nthe state of the underlying resources such as utilization, load, and\ntemperature, but also with the goal to provide predictable program execution on\nMPSoCs by claiming processing resources exclusively as the default and thus\neliminating interferences and creating the necessary isolation between multiple\nconcurrently running applications. For achieving this goal, invasive computing\nintroduces new programming constructs for resource-aware programming that\nmeanwhile, for testing purpose, have been embedded into the parallel computing\nlanguage X10 as developed by IBM using a library-based approach.\n  This paper presents major ideas and common terms of invasive computing as\ninvestigated by the DFG Transregional Collaborative Research Centre TR89.\nMoreoever, a reflection is given on the granularity of resources that may be\nrequested by invasive programs.\n"]}]
