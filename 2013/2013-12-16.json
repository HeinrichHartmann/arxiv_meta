The quantities\nconsidered in these tests are the critical coupling for the transition to the\nordered phase and the associated critical exponents nu and beta. We also map\nout the phase diagram in four dimensions. In two and three dimensions, DMFT\nincorrectly predicts a first order phase transition for all bare quartic\ncouplings, which is problematic, because the second order nature of the phase\ntransition of lattice phi^4-theory is crucial for taking the continuum limit.\nNevertheless, by extrapolating the behaviour away from the phase transition,\none can obtain critical couplings and critical exponents. They differ from\nthose of mean field theory and are much closer to the correct values. In four\ndimensions the transition is second order for small quartic couplings and turns\nweakly first order as the coupling increases beyond a tricritical value.

Protein folding is a case in point. We show that the\naction principle can be applied directly to study the stability of biological\nprocesses. The action principle in classical physics starts with the first\nvariation of the action and leads immediately to the equations of motion. The\nsecond variation of the action leads in a natural way to powerful theorems that\nprovide quantitative treatment of stability and focusing and also explain how\nsome very complex processes can behave as though some seemingly important\nforces drop out. We first apply these ideas to the non-equilibrium states\ninvolved in two-state folding. We treat torsional waves and use the action\nprinciple to talk about critical points in the dynamics. For some proteins the\ntheory resembles TST. We reach several quantitative and qualitative\nconclusions. Besides giving an explanation of why TST often works in folding,\nwe find that the apparent smoothness of the energy funnel is a natural\nconsequence of the putative critical points in the dynamics. These ideas also\nexplain why biological proteins fold to unique states and random polymers do\nnot. The insensitivity to perturbations which follows from the presence of\ncritical points explains how folding to a unique shape occurs in the presence\nof dilute denaturing agents in spite of the fact that those agents disrupt the\nfolded structure of the native state. This paper contributes to the theoretical\narmamentarium by directing attention to the logical progression from first\nphysical principles to the stability theorems related to catastrophe theory as\napplied to folding.

The method is particularly\nsuited to study systems that are inhomogeneous, and/or have a boundary. As a\nproof of concept, we use the density matrix renormalization group to solve the\nequivalent one-dimensional problem. The resulting dimensional reduction\ntranslates into a reduction of the scaling of the entanglement entropy by a\nfactor $L^{d-1}$, where L is the linear dimension of the original d-dimensional\nlattice. This allows one to calculate the ground state of a magnetic impurity\nattached to an LxL square lattice and an LxLxL cubic lattice with L up to 140\nsites. We also study the localized edge states in graphene nanoribbons by\nattaching a magnetic impurity to the edge or the center of the system.

In the presented study, four different types of BGRWs\nand an algorithm based on the ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic were\nconsidered.

We\nargue for this scenario using large field inflation assumed during a typical\nslow-roll regime, and typical values for the physical quantities associated\nwith the tunneling effect are worked out. It is shown how, as a result of these\nhighly energetic and localized processes, the components of the metric receive\nstrong gradients within a small volume. These pockets of gravity can gravitate\nboth attractively or repulsively, since the Ricci tensor contains squared\npartial derivative terms with either positive or negative sign, so they can be\na component of either dark matter or dark energy. As the Universe expands the\ncurvature of the pockets weakens as 1/a^2, where a(t) is the scale factor of\nthe expansion, but it is shown that, as long as the integral over the\ngravitating gravitational fields of the pocket is done over all of the\nexpanding volume of the pocket, the value of the integral is not affected by\nthe expansion. Geometrically speaking, the gravitation of a pocket is produced\nby the convolutions of the metric inside it; as the Universe expands the\nconvolutions are over a much large volume so they are flatter, but an\nintegration over the larger volume gives the same result as before the\nexpansion. It is just a change of scale of the same geometry.

Since direct measurements are\noften not feasible, indirect methods, e.g. (d,p) reactions, should be used.}\nThose (d,p) reactions may be viewed as three-body reactions and described with\nFaddeev techniques.\n  Purpose: Faddeev equations in momentum space have a long tradition of\nutilizing separable interactions in order to arrive at sets of coupled integral\nequations in one variable. While there exist several separable representations\nfor the nucleon-nucleon interaction, the optical potential between a neutron\n(proton) and a nucleus is not readily available in separable form. The purpose\nof this paper is to introduce a separable representation for complex\nphenomenological optical potentials of Woods-Saxon type.\n  Results: Starting from a global optical potential, a separable representation\nthereof is introduced based on the Ernst-Shakin-Thaler (EST) scheme. This\nscheme is generalized to non-hermitian potentials. Applications to n$+^{48}$Ca,\nn$+^{132}$Sn and n$+^{208}$Pb are investigated for energies from 0 to 50 MeV\nand the quality of the representation is examined.\n  Conclusions: We find a good description of the on-shell t-matrix for all\nsystems with rank up to 5. The required rank depends inversely on the angular\nmomentum. The resulting separable interaction exhibits a different off-shell\nbehavior compared to the original potential, reducing the high momentum\ncontributions.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Among the several AI approaches, player\nmodeling is becoming an important one. The main idea is to understand and model\nthe player characteristics and behaviors in order to develop a better AI. In\nthis work, we discuss several aspects of this new field. We proposed a taxonomy\nto organize the area, discussing several facets of this topic, ranging from\nimplementation decisions up to what a model attempts to describe. We then\nclassify, in our taxonomy, some of the most important works in this field. We\nalso presented a generic approach to deal with player modeling using ML, and we\ninstantiated this approach to model players' preferences in the game\nCivilization IV. The instantiation of this approach has several steps. We first\ndiscuss a generic representation, regardless of what is being modeled, and\nevaluate it performing experiments with the strategy game Civilization IV.\nContinuing the instantiation of the proposed approach we evaluated the\napplicability of using game score information to distinguish different\npreferences. We presented a characterization of virtual agents in the game,\ncomparing their behavior with their stated preferences. Once we have\ncharacterized these agents, we were able to observe that different preferences\ngenerate different behaviors, measured by several game indicators. We then\ntackled the preference modeling problem as a binary classification task, with a\nsupervised learning approach. We compared four different methods, based on\ndifferent paradigms (SVM, AdaBoost, NaiveBayes and JRip), evaluating them on a\nset of matches played by different virtual agents. We conclude our work using\nthe learned models to infer human players' preferences.
