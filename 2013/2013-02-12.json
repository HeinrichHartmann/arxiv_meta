The possibility of a single SMBHB being tracked first by PTA, through\ninspiral, and later by SLI, up to merger and ring down, has been previously\nsuggested. Although the bounding parameters are drawn by the current PTA or the\nupcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA), and by the New Gravitational Observatory\n(NGO), derived from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), this paper\nalso addresses sequential detection beyond specific project constraints. We\nconsider PTA-SKA, which is sensitive from 10^(-9) to p x 10^(-7) Hz (p=4, 8),\nand SLI, which operates from s x 10^(-5) up to 1 Hz (s = 1, 3). A SMBHB in the\nrange 2x 10^(8) - 2 x 10^(9) solar masses (the masses are normalised to a (1+z)\nfactor, the red shift lying between z = 0.2 and z=1.5) moves from the PTA-SKA\nto the SLI band over a period ranging from two months to fifty years. By\ncombining three Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH)-host relations with three\naccretion prescriptions, nine astrophysical scenarios are formed. They are then\nrelated to three levels of pulsar timing residuals (50, 5, 1 ns), generating\ntwenty-seven cases. For residuals of 1 ns, sequential detection probability\nwill never be better than 4.7 x 10^(-4) y^(-2) or 3.3 x 10^(-6) y^(-2) (per\nyear to merger and per year of survey), according to the best and worst\nastrophysical scenarios, respectively; put differently this means one\nsequential detection every 46 or 550 years for an equivalent maximum time to\nmerger and duration of the survey. The chances of sequential detection are\nfurther reduced by increasing values of the s parameter (they vanish for s =\n10) and of the SLI noise, and by decreasing values of the remnant spin.

Recent studies revealed that some living fossils such as the\nlungfish are indeed evolving more slowly than other vertebrates (2, 3). The\nreason for the slower rate of evolution in these lineages remains unclear, but\nthe same observations suggest a possible genome size effect on rates of\nevolution. Genome size (C-value) in vertebrates varies over 200 fold ranging\nfrom pufferfish (0.4 pg) to lungfish (132.8 pg) (4). Variation in genome size\nand architecture is a fundamental cellular adaptation that remains poorly\nunderstood (5). C-value is correlated with several allometric traits such as\nbody size and developmental rates in many, but not all, organisms (6, 7). To\ndate, no consensus exists concerning the mechanisms driving genome size\nevolution or the effect that genome size has on species traits such as\nevolutionary rates (8-12). In the following we show that: 1) within the same\nrange of divergence times, genetic diversity decreases as genome size increases\nand 2) average rates of molecular evolution decline with increasing genome size\nin vertebrates.

This rotational vacuum effect may lead to the emergence of permanently\nrotating objects provided the negative rotational energy of zero-point\nfluctuations cancels the positive rotational energy of the device itself. In\nthis paper, we show that for massless electrically charged particles the\nrotational vacuum effect should be drastically (astronomically) enhanced in the\npresence of a magnetic field. As an illustration, we show that in a background\nof experimentally available magnetic fields the zero-point energy of massless\nexcitations in rotating torus-shaped doped carbon nanotubes may indeed\noverwhelm the classical energy of rotation for certain angular frequencies so\nthat the permanently rotating state is energetically favored. The suggested\n\"zero-point driven\" devices -- which have no internally moving parts --\ncorrespond to a perpetuum mobile of a new, fourth kind: They do not produce any\nwork despite the fact that their equilibrium (ground) state corresponds to a\npermanent rotation even in the presence of an external environment.

We used\nbioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species\nusing publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. The assumption that\nthe most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA was true for most species\nwhose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a\ngeneral property of genomes. Our methods are compatible with all current\nsequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to\nfind tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp.

While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically\ndetermined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at\ncentromeres of both animals and plants.

Although none of the individual galaxies are robustly\ndetected in the Bolocam data, the ensemble-average flux density at 140 GHz is\nconsistent with, but slightly lower than, the extrapolation from lower\nfrequencies assuming a constant spectral index. In addition, our data indicate\nan intrinsic scatter of 30 percent around the power-law extrapolated flux\ndensities at 140 GHz, although our data do not tightly constrain this scatter.\nFor our cluster sample, which is composed of high-mass and moderate-redshift\nsystems, we find that the maximum fractional change in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\nsignal integrated over any single cluster due to the presence of these radio\nsources is 20 percent, and only 1/4 of the clusters show a fractional change of\nmore than 1 percent. The amount of contamination is strongly dependent on\ncluster morphology, and nearly all of the clusters with more than 1 percent\ncontamination are cool-core systems. This result indicates that radio\ncontamination is not significant compared to current noise levels in 140 GHz\nimages of massive clusters and is in good agreement with the level of radio\ncontamination found in previous results based on lower frequency data or\nsimulations.\n","Comment: Updated per referee's comments"]}]

The giant planets migrated significant distances to reach their current\nlocations, and evidence of that migration's influence on the Solar system\nabounds. That migration's pace, and the distance over which it occurred, is\nstill heavily debated. Some models feature systems in which the giant planets\nwere initially in an extremely compact configuration, in which Uranus and\nNeptune are chaotically scattered into the outer Solar system. Others feature\narchitectures that were initially more relaxed, and smoother, more sedate\nmigration. To determine which of these scenarios best represents the formation\nof our Solar system, we must turn to the structure of the system's small body\npopulations, in which the scars of that migration are still clearly visible.\n  We present the first results of a program investigating the effect of giant\nplanet migration on the reservoirs of small bodies that existed at that time.\nAs the planets migrate, they stir these reservoirs, scattering vast numbers of\nsmall bodies onto dynamically unstable orbits in the outer Solar system. The\ngreat majority of those bodies are rapidly removed from the system, through\ncollisions and ejections, but a small number become captured as planetary\nTrojans or irregular satellites. Others are driven by the migration, leading to\na significant sculpting of the asteroid belt and trans-Neptunian region.\n  The capture and retention efficiencies to these stable reservoirs depend on\nthe particular migration scenario used. Advocates of chaotic migration from an\ninitially compact scenario argue that smoother, more sedate migration cannot\nexplain the observed populations of Trojans and irregular satellites.

This method\nis termed the spectral recovery method (SRM). Interestingly, the SVD of the\nrestricted put and call operators sheds some new light on the RND recovery\nproblem. The SRM improves on other RND recovery methods in the sense that:\n  - it is fast and simple to implement since it requires solution of a single\nquadratic program, while being fully nonparametric; - it takes the bid ask\nquotes as sole input and does not require any sort of calibration, smoothing or\npreprocessing of the data; - it is robust to the paucity of price quotes; - it\nreturns the smoothest density giving rise to prices that lie inside the bid ask\nquotes. The estimated RND is therefore as well-behaved as can be; - it returns\na closed form estimate of the RND on the interval [0,B] of the positive real\nline, where B is a positive constant that can be chosen arbitrarily. We thus\nobtain both the middle part of the RND together with its full left tail and\npart of its right tail.\n  We confront this method to both real and simulated data and observe that it\nfares well in practice. The SRM is thus found to be a promising alternative to\nother RND recovery methods.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 17 figures"]}]
