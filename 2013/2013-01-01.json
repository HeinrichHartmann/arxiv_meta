However, by identifying coherent structures\nin their state spaces, i.e., regions of uniform and simpler behavior, we could\nhope to study each of the structures separately and then form the understanding\nof the system as a whole. The method we present in this paper uses trajectory\naverages of scalar functions on the state space to: (a) identify invariant sets\nin the state space, (b) form coherent structures by aggregating invariant sets\nthat are similar across multiple spatial scales. First, we construct the\nergodic quotient, the object obtained by mapping trajectories to the space of\ntrajectory averages of a function basis on the state space. Second, we endow\nthe ergodic quotient with a metric structure that successfully captures how\nsimilar the invariant sets are in the state space.

A multi-vortices model is developed to\nmodel both the leading edge and trailing edge vortices (TEVs), which offers\nimproved accuracy compared with using only single vortex at each separation\nlocation. The lift is obtained by integrating the unsteady Blasius equation. It\nis found that the motion of vortices contributes significantly to the overall\naerodynamic force on the flat plate. The shedding of TEVs and the stabilization\nof LEVs explicitly contributes to lift enhancement. A Kutta-like condition is\nused to determine the vortex intensity and location at the leading edge for\nlarge angle of attack cases; however, it is proposed to relax this condition\nfor small angle of attack cases and apply a 2D shear layer model to calculate\nthe circulation of the new added vortex. The results of the simulation are then\ncompared with classical numerical, modeled and experimental data for canonical\nunsteady flat plat problems. Good agreement with these data is observed.\nMoreover, these results suggested that the leading edge vortex shedding for\nsmall angles of attack should be modeled differently than that for large angles\nof attack. Finally, the results of vortex motion vs. lift indicate that both a\nmotion against the streamwise direction of the LEV and a streamwise motion of\nthe TEV contributes positive lift.

As a consequence our results show that the\nquestion of equilibrium in genetic systems should be approached in close\nanalogy to non-equilibrium statistical physics and its observability should be\nfocused on dynamical quantities like the typical decay properties of the\nallelic auto correlation function in time.

We observe a complex\ntransition path from the initial state to the final state of the AND gate. This\npath is strongly influenced by non-ideal effects due to transient bubbles\nrevealing undesired toeholds and thermal melting of whole strands. We have also\ncharacterized the bound and unbound kinetics of single strands, and in\nparticular the kinetics of the total AND operation and the three distinct\ndistinct DNA transitions that it is based on. We observe a exponential kinetic\ndependence on the toehold length of the competitive displacement operation, but\nthat the gate operation time is only weakly dependent on both the toehold and\nadjacent domain length. Our gate displays excellent logical fidelity in three\ninput states, and quite poor fidelity in the fourth input state. This\nillustrates how non-ideality can have very selective effects on fidelity.\nSimulations and detailed analysis such as those presented here provide\nmolecular insights into strand displacement computation, that can be also be\nexpected in chemical implementations.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 7 figures.

We find that transmembrane\ndomains evolve more slowly than do extramembrane domains, though TM domains\ndisplay increased rate heterogeneity relative to their EM counterparts.\nAlthough the majority of residues across GPCRs experience strong to weak\npurifying selection, many GPCRs experience positive selection at both TM and EM\nresidues, albeit with a slight bias towards the EM.

If it is\nset within its classical mechanics roots, it is clear that it is a restricted\nform of a Lagrangian.\n  In advanced texts on fracture cracks are treated as dynamic entities, and the\nrole of stress waves is clearly articulated. However, in most non-advanced\ntexts on fracture and fatigue the role of stress waves are either not included\nor not emphasised, often leading to a possible misunderstanding of the\nfundamentals of fracture.\n  What is done here is to extend Griffiths approach by setting it within the\nconcept of Stationary Action, and introducing a quasi-static stress wave\nunloading model, which connects the energy release mechanism with the stress\nfield. This leads to a definition of a dynamic stress intensity factor, and\nthis model is then applied to fatigue of perfectly elastic and elastic-plastic\nmaterials to include crack tip plasticity.\n  The results for the Griffiths crack and the dynamic case are retrodiction, to\nestablish the validity of the methods used. The extension to fatigue gives\nsignificant new results, which show that for elastic-plastic materials the\ninfluence of the maximum stress in the cycle as a fraction of the yield stress,\ncalled the yield stress ratio, has not been recognised.

We thus fully characterize\nthe frontier between tractability and intractability for RSPQs, and we refine\nour results to show the following trichotomy: Evaluations of RSPQs is either\nAC0, NL-complete or NP-complete in data complexity, depending on the regular\nlanguage L.
