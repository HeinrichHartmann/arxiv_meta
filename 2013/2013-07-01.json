This Giant Faraday rotation originates from the\ncyclotron resonance of massless electrons, which allows dynamical tuning\nthrough either external electrostatic or magnetostatic setting. Furthermore,\nthe rotation direction can be controlled by changing the sign of the carriers\nin graphene, which can be done by means of an external electric field. However,\ndespite these tuning possibilities, the requirement of large magnetic fields\nhinders application of the Faraday effect in real devices, especially for\nfrequencies higher than few THz. In this work we demonstrate that, for a given\nvalue of the static external magnetic field, giant Faraday rotation can be\nachieved in arrays of graphene microribbons at frequencies much higher than the\ncorresponding cyclotron frequency. The main feature in the magneto-optical\nresponse of graphene ribbons is not associated with the cyclotron resonance but\nrather with the fundamental magnetoplasmon excitation of a single ribbon. The\nmagnetoplasmon nature of Faraday rotation in graphene ribbons opens great\npossibilities, as the resonance frequency can be locally selected by\nappropriately choosing the width of the ribbon while still preserving the\ntuning capability through a (smaller) external magnetic field.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures"]}]

In cases where it has been tested\nexperimentally, this reflected shock approximation (RSA) has been found to be\nfairly accurate at pressures as high as 100 GPa. The success of the RSA is\nusually attributed to the lack of thermal effects, i.e., that the Hugoniot and\nrelease adiabat are nearly identical in the pressure-density (P-rho) plane.\nThis report demonstrates that this explanation is not correct. The success of\nthe RSA does not arise from the absence of thermal effects--it arises because\nof thermal effects. When the Hugoniot and adiabat are identical in the P-rho\nplane, the adiabat lies below the reflected Hugoniot when mapped into the P-UP\nplane. Material strength effects also cause the exact adiabat to lie below the\nRSA. A thermal offset between the Hugoniot and the adiabat compensates for\nthese two effects, so that the RSA turns out to give good results for many\nmaterials, even at high pressures. However, this fortuitous cancellation of\nerrors does not occur in all cases. This report shows that the RSA is not\naccurate for two \"soft\" materials, Teflon and PMMA, and for a high-strength\nmaterial, tungsten.

In [39] it was considered a multiagent system in which the agents\nare eager to perform a collective task depending on the perception of the\nwillingness to perform the task of other individuals.
