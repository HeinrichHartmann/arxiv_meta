In this paper, we address this problem by solving the\nchemical master equations for various enzymatic reactions. We devise a\nperturbation theory analogous to that used in quantum mechanics that allows us\nto determine the first (<n>) and the second (variance) cumulants of the\ndistribution of created product molecules as a function of the substrate\nconcentration and the kinetic rates of the intermediate processes. The mean\nproduct flux V=d<n>/dt (or \"dose-response\" curve) and the Fano factor\nF=variance/<n> are both realistically measurable quantities, and while the mean\nflux can often appear the same for different reaction types, the Fano factor\ncan be quite different. This suggests both qualitative and quantitative ways to\ndiscriminate between different reaction schemes, and we explore this\npossibility in the context of four sample multistep enzymatic reactions. We\nargue that measuring both the mean flux and the Fano factor can not only\ndiscriminate between reaction types, but can also provide some detailed\ninformation about the internal, unobserved kinetic rates, and this can be done\nwithout measuring single-molecule transition events.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Yet, the presence of a baryonic disc is\nbelieved to alter the shape of the haloes. Here we aim to study how bar\nformation is affected by halo triaxiality and how, in turn, the presence of the\nbar influences the shape of the halo. We perform a set of collisionless N-body\nsimulations of disc galaxies with triaxial dark matter haloes, using elliptical\ndiscs as initial conditions. We study models of different halo triaxialities\nand, to investigate the behaviour of the halo shape in the absence of bar\nformation, we run models with different disc masses, halo concentrations, disc\nvelocity dispersions and also models where the disc shape is kept artificially\naxisymmetric. We find that the introduction of a massive disc causes the halo\ntriaxiality to be partially diluted. Once the disc is fully grown, a strong\nstellar bar develops within the halo that is still non-axisymmetric, causing it\nto lose its remaining non-axisymmetry. In triaxial haloes in which the initial\nconditions are such that a bar does not form, the halo is able to remain\ntriaxial and the circularisation of its shape on the plane of the disc is\nlimited to the period of disc growth. We conclude that part of the\ncircularisation of the halo is due to disc growth, but part must be attributed\nto the formation of a bar. We find that initially circular discs respond\nexcessively to the triaxial potential and become highly elongated. They also\nlose more angular momentum than the initially elliptical discs and thus form\nstronger bars. Because of that, the circularisation that their bars induce on\ntheir haloes is also more rapid. We also analyse halo vertical shapes and\nobserve that their vertical flattenings remain considerable, meaning that the\nhaloes become approximately oblate by the end of the simulations.

We find that for Abelian anyons, the walk retains the\nballistic spreading velocity just like particles with trivial braiding\nstatistics. For non-Abelian anyons, the numerical results indicate that the\nspreading velocity is linearly dependent on the number of time steps.

We show a very close relation between gauge anomalies\nand symmetry-protected trivial (SPT) orders [also known as symmetry-protected\ntopological (SPT) orders] in one-higher dimensions. Using such an idea, we\nargue that, in d space-time dimensions, the gauge anomalies are described by\nthe elements in Free[H^{d+1}(G,R/Z)]\\oplus H_\\pi^{d+1}(BG,R/Z). The well known\nAdler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies are classified by the free part of the group\ncohomology class H^{d+1}(G,R/Z) of the gauge group G (denoted as\nFree[H^{d+1}(G,\\R/\\Z)]). We refer other kinds of gauge anomalies beyond\nAdler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies as nonABJ gauge anomalies, which include Witten\nSU(2) global gauge anomaly. We introduce a notion of \\pi-cohomology group,\nH_\\pi^{d+1}(BG,R/Z), for the classifying space BG, which is an Abelian group\nand include Tor[H^{d+1}(G,R/Z)] and topological cohomology group\nH^{d+1}(BG,R/Z) as subgroups. We argue that H_\\pi^{d+1}(BG,R/Z) classifies the\nbosonic nonABJ gauge anomalies, and partially classifies fermionic nonABJ\nanomalies. Using the same approach that shows gauge anomalies to be connected\nto SPT phases, we can also show that gravitational anomalies are connected to\ntopological orders (ie patterns of long-range entanglement) in one-higher\ndimension.\n","Comment: 23 pages, RevTeX4, 3 figures, 1 table"]}]

The primary benefit of caching is the enormous increase in\ndownloading rate when a popular file is available at helpers near a user\nrequesting that file. In this work, we explore a secondary benefit of caching\nin this architecture through the lens of index coding. We assume a system with\nn users and constant number of caching helpers. Only helpers store files, i.e.\nhave side information. We investigate the following scenario: Each user\nrequests a distinct file that is not found in the set of helpers nearby. Users\nare served coded packets (through an index code) by an omniscient base station.\nEvery user decodes its desired packet from the coded packets and the side\ninformation packets from helpers nearby. We assume that users can obtain any\nfile stored in their neighboring helpers without incurring transmission costs.\nWith respect to the index code employed, we investigate two achievable schemes:\n1) XOR coloring based on coloring of the side information graph associated with\nthe problem and 2)Vector XOR coloring based on fractional coloring of the side\ninformation graph. We show that the general problem reduces to a canonical\nproblem where every user is connected to exactly one helper under some\ntopological constraints. For the canonical problem, with constant number of\nhelpers (k), we show that the complexity of computing the best XOR/vector XOR\ncoloring schemes are polynomial in the number of users n. The result exploits a\nspecial complete bi-partite structure that the side information graphs exhibit\nfor any finite k.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 Figures"]}]

Then the expression of the\ngravity gradient torque in terms of gravitational potential derivatives is\nderived. By using the formulation of the gravitational potential, explicit\nformulations of the full fourth-order gravity gradient torque are obtained.\nThen a numerical simulation is carried out to verify our model.

The main result of this work is the\nproof that the energy of the Einstein-equivariant wave map system does not\nconcentrate during the Cauchy evolution. A key ingredient in the proof is the\nuse of the fact that geometric mass at infinity of the Einstein-equivariant\nwave map system is conserved during the evolution. However, this observation\nhas some subtle local implications which have been used to estimate the energy\nlocally. For instance, we construct a divergence-free vector field which gives\nmonotonicity of energy in the past null cone of any point. In addition, this\nvector has also been used to prove that the energy does not concentrate away\nfrom the axis of the domain manifold. Later, estimating the divergence of a\nMorawetz vector on a truncated past null cone, we prove that the kinetic energy\ndoes not concentrate. Finally, assuming that the target manifold satisfies the\nGrillakis condition, we proceed to prove the non-concentration of energy for\nthe critical Einstein-equivariant wave map system. Keeping track of various\nquantities of wave map relative to the evolving null geometry of the background\nmanifold is a recurring theme throughout the course of this work.\n  Apart from a purely mathematical interest, the motivation to study critical\nself-gravitating wave maps is that they occur naturally in 3+1 Einstein's\nequations of general relativity. Therefore, studying critical self-gravitating\nwave maps could be a fruitful way of understanding the ever elusive global\nbehaviour of Einstein's equations.
