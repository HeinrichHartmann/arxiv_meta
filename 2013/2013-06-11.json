We show that, up to conjugation with a 1-homogenic\nbirational plane transformation (1-BIR), all solutions are as follows: a zero\nflow, two singular flows, an identity flow, and one non-singular flow for each\nnon-negative integer N, called the level of the flow. The case N=0 stands\napart, while the case N=1 has special features as well. Conjugation of these\ncanonical solutions with 1-BIR produce a variety of flows with different\nproperties and invariants, depending on the level and on the conjugation\nitself. We explore many more features of these flows; for example, there are 1,\n4, and 2 essentially different symmetric flows in cases N=0, N=1, and N>=2,\nrespectively. Many more questions will be treated in the second part of this\nwork.\n","Comment: 54 pages, 6 figures. Final version before proofs"]}]

It is well-known in\ntilting theory that an almost complete tilting module for any finite\ndimensional algebra over a field k is a direct summand of exactly 1 or 2\ntilting modules. An important property in cluster tilting theory is that an\nalmost complete cluster-tilting object in a 2-CY triangulated category is a\ndirect summand of exactly 2 cluster-tilting objects. Reformulated for path\nalgebras kQ, this says that an almost complete support tilting modules has\nexactly two complements. We generalize (support) tilting modules to what we\ncall (support) tau-tilting modules, and show that an almost support tau-tilting\nmodule has exactly two complements for any finite dimensional algebra. For a\nfinite dimensional k-algebra A, we establish bijections between functorially\nfinite torsion classes in mod A, support tau-tilting modules and two-term\nsilting complexes in Kb(proj A). Moreover these objects correspond bijectively\nto cluster-tilting objects in C if A is a 2-CY tilted algebra associated with a\n2-CY triangulated category C.

The so-called coarsening exponent $n$ characterizes the time\ndependence of the scale of the pattern, $L(t)\\approx t^n$, and coarsening\ndynamics can be described by a diffusion equation for the phase of the pattern.\nBy means of a multiscale analysis we are able to find the analytical expression\nof such diffusion equations.

While inherently insensitive to visible spectrum\nillumination changes, IR data introduces specific challenges of its own, most\nnotably sensitivity to factors which affect facial heat emission patterns, e.g.\nemotional state, ambient temperature, and alcohol intake. In addition, facial\nexpression and pose changes are more difficult to correct in IR images because\nthey are less rich in high frequency detail which is an important cue for\nfitting any deformable model. In this paper we describe a novel method which\naddresses these major challenges. Specifically, when comparing two thermal IR\nimages of faces, we mutually normalize their poses and facial expressions by\nusing an active appearance model (AAM) to generate synthetic images of the two\nfaces with a neutral facial expression and in the same view (the average of the\ntwo input views). This is achieved by piecewise affine warping which follows\nAAM fitting. A major contribution of our work is the use of an AAM ensemble in\nwhich each AAM is specialized to a particular range of poses and a particular\nregion of the thermal IR face space. Combined with the contributions from our\nprevious work which addressed the problem of reliable AAM fitting in the\nthermal IR spectrum, and the development of a person-specific representation\nrobust to transient changes in the pattern of facial temperature emissions, the\nproposed ensemble framework accurately matches faces across the full range of\nyaw from frontal to profile, even in the presence of scale variation (e.g. due\nto the varying distance of a subject from the camera).\n","Comment: International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2013. arXiv admin\n  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1306.1609"]}]

In one interpretation, the switching originates\nfrom carriers with spin-dependent scattering giving rise to a relativistic\nanti-damping spin-orbit torque (SOT) in structures with broken space-inversion\nsymmetry. The alternative interpretation combines the relativistic spin Hall\neffect (SHE), making the normal-conductor an injector of a spin-current, with\nthe non-relativistic spin-transfer torque (STT) in the ferromagnet. Remarkably,\nthe SHE in these experiments originates from the Berry phase effect in the band\nstructure of a clean crystal and the anti-damping STT is also based on a\ndisorder-independent transfer of spin from carriers to magnetization. Here we\nreport the observation of an anti-damping SOT stemming from an analogous Berry\nphase effect to the SHE. The SOT alone can therefore induce magnetization\ndynamics based on a scattering-independent principle. The ferromagnetic\nsemiconductor (Ga,Mn)As we use has a broken space-inversion symmetry in the\ncrystal.

It\nis well known that, without additional assumptions, rendezvous is impossible if\nthe entities are oblivious (i.e., have no persistent memory) even if the system\nis semi-synchronous (SSynch). It has been recently shown that rendezvous is\npossible even if the system is asynchronous (ASynch) if each robot is endowed\nwith O(1) bits of persistent memory, can transmit O(1) bits in each cycle, and\ncan remember (i.e., can persistently store) the last received transmission.\nThis setting is overly powerful.\n  In this paper we weaken that setting in two different ways: (1) by\nmaintaining the O(1) bits of persistent memory but removing the communication\ncapabilities; and (2) by maintaining the O(1) transmission capability and the\nability to remember the last received transmission, but removing the ability of\nan agent to remember its previous activities.

Note that,\neven though its use is very different, in both settings, the amount of\npersistent memory of a robot is constant.\n  We investigate the rendezvous problem in these two weaker settings.

The reconstruction of gene trees based on sequence alone almost always\ninvolves choosing between statistically equivalent or weakly distinguishable\nrelationships that could be much better resolved based on a putative species\ntree. To exploit this potential for accurate reconstruction of gene trees the\nspace of reconciled gene trees must be explored according to a joint model of\nsequence evolution and gene tree-species tree reconciliation.\n  Here we present amalgamated likelihood estimation (ALE), a probabilistic\napproach to exhaustively explore all reconciled gene trees that can be\namalgamated as a combination of clades observed in a sample of trees. We\nimplement ALE in the context of a reconciliation model, which allows for the\nduplication, transfer and loss of genes. We use ALE to efficiently approximate\nthe sum of the joint likelihood over amalgamations and to find the reconciled\ngene tree that maximizes the joint likelihood.\n  We demonstrate using simulations that gene trees reconstructed using the\njoint likelihood are substantially more accurate than those reconstructed using\nsequence alone. Using realistic topologies, branch lengths and alignment sizes,\nwe demonstrate that ALE produces more accurate gene trees even if the model of\nsequence evolution is greatly simplified. Finally, examining 1099 gene families\nfrom 36 cyanobacterial genomes we find that joint likelihood-based inference\nresults in a striking reduction in apparent phylogenetic discord, with 24%, 59%\nand 46% percent reductions in the mean numbers of duplications, transfers and\nlosses.\n","Comment: Manuscript accepted pending revision in Systematic Biology"]}]

Zucchelli has proposed a method in which pure (anti-)nu_e beams are\ngenerated by the beta-decay of relativistic radio-nuclides stored in a high\nenergy storage ring pointing towards a far away neutrino detector. Since they\nhave a much smaller transverse momentum distribution, the neutrino flux will be\nmuch more narrowly concentrated than with a horn. The isomeric doublet Li-8\n(anti-nu_e, tau_1/2=0.84s) and B-8 (nu_e, tau_1/2=0.77s) has been studied.\nNeutrino and antineutrino beams are produced with an average transverse\nmomentum of about 6.5 MeV/c. Radioactive ions may be generated with a dedicated\ntable-top storage ring to supply a suitable ion source to be accelerated at\nhigh energies either at FNAL or at CERN. Ions should then extracted from the\naccelerator and accumulated in a decay storage ring with a long straight\nsection pointing toward the neutrino detector. A massive detector based on\nliquid Argon technology is probably offering the best opportunities for such\nfuture programme. The present ICARUS LAr-TPC experiment has already collected\nat LNGS events in the relevant neutrino energy region. They should provide a\nfirst evidence for a conclusive experimental study of the competing signals and\nmore generally for the actual feasibility of the beta-beam option in a search\nof the CP violating phase.

Second, the $R^2$ gravity leads to specific near scale-invariant\nHarrison-Zel'dovich spectra both for the scalar and the tensor perturbations.\nThird, using the COBE-DMR data we derive the strong constraints on the coupling\nconstant and the energy scale during the inflation. Also, our result shows the\ngravitational wave contribution to the CMBR anisotropy is negligible. So, the\nfuture observation can provide the strong constraints on the inflation model\nbased on $R^2$ gravity.

Such plants\nwould be similar to hydro-electric plants and would have their advantages of\nnot needing fuel and not polluting the environment.\n  Physically, the action of deflecting away gravitational attraction, which of\ncourse is directed toward the gravitation source, produces an equal but\nopposite reaction on the mechanism that produces the deflection of the\ngravitational action [the deflector], a reaction directed away from the\ngravitation source.\n  The result is the combination of reducing the gravitational attractive\nacceleration of the object toward the gravitation source plus the introducing\nof a reactive acceleration on the object in the direction away from the\ngravitation source.\n  Such a deflector, engineered to enable controlled adjustment of the amount\nand the direction of its action, could provide for a spacecraft both launch\nlevitation and deep space travel acceleration.
