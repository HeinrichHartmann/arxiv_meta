C-WMMG models a basic\ncooperation rule, the complementary cooperation rule, and can be taken as a\nsister model of the famous weighted majority game (WMG for short). In this\npaper, we concentrate on the two dimensional C-WMMG. An interesting property of\nthis case is that there are at most $n+1$ minimal winning coalitions (MWC for\nshort), and they can be enumerated in time $O(n\\log n)$, where $n$ is the\nnumber of players. This property guarantees that the two dimensional C-WMMG is\nmore handleable than WMG. In particular, we prove that the main power indices,\ni.e. the Shapley-Shubik index, the Penrose-Banzhaf index, the Holler-Packel\nindex, and the Deegan-Packel index, are all polynomially computable. To make a\ncomparison with WMG, we know that it may have exponentially many MWCs, and none\nof the four power indices is polynomially computable (unless P=NP). Still for\nthe two dimensional case, we show that local monotonicity holds for all of the\nfour power indices. In WMG, this property is possessed by the Shapley-Shubik\nindex and the Penrose-Banzhaf index, but not by the Holler-Packel index or the\nDeegan-Packel index. Since our model fits very well the cooperation and\ncompetition in team sports, we hope that it can be potentially applied in\nmeasuring the values of players in team sports, say help people give more\nobjective ranking of NBA players and select MVPs, and consequently bring new\ninsights into contest theory and the more general field of sports economics. It\nmay also provide some interesting enlightenments into the design of\nnon-additive voting mechanisms.

Using the linearized time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau\nequation, we obtain the temperature dependence of the instability line,\nV_{inst}(T), where nucleation of superconductivity takes place. For\nsufficiently low biases, a stationary symmetric superconducting state emerges\nbelow the instability line. For higher biases, the normal phase is destroyed by\nthe formation of a non-stationary bimodal state with two superconducting nuclei\nlocalized near the opposite terminals. The low-temperature and large-voltage\nbehavior of the instability line is highly sensitive to the details of the\ninelastic relaxation mechanism in the wire. Therefore, experimental studies of\nV_{inst}(T) in NSN junctions may be used as an effective tool to access\nparameters of the inelastic relaxation in the normal state.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures"]}]

While spins in solids are attractive candidates for scalable\nquantum information processing, thus far single-shot detection has only been\nachieved for isolated qubits. Here, we demonstrate preparation and measurement\nof a multi-spin quantum register by implementing resonant optical excitation\ntechniques originally developed in atomic physics. We achieve high-fidelity\nreadout of the electronic spin associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ncentre in diamond at low temperature, and exploit this readout to project up to\nthree nearby nuclear spin qubits onto a well-defined state. Conversely, we can\ndistinguish the state of the nuclear spins in a single shot by mapping it onto\nand subsequently measuring the electronic spin. Finally, we show compatibility\nwith qubit control by demonstrating initialization, coherent manipulation, and\nsingle-shot readout in a single experiment on a two-qubit register, using\ntechniques suitable for extension to larger registers. These results pave the\nway for the first test of Bell's inequalities on solid-state spins and the\nimplementation of measurement-based quantum information protocols.\n","Comment: final version can be found on www.nature.com"]}]

The balance of supply and demand of electric energy is one of the\nmost important requirements of MG management. In this paper, we present a novel\nframework for smart energy management based on the concept of\nquality-of-service in electricity (QoSE). Specifically, the resident\nelectricity demand is classified into basic usage and quality usage. The basic\nusage is always guaranteed by the MG, while the quality usage is controlled\nbased on the MG state. The microgrid control center (MGCC) aims to minimize the\nMG operation cost and maintain the outage probability of quality usage, i.e.,\nQoSE, below a target value, by scheduling electricity among renewable energy\nresources, energy storage systems, and macrogrid. The problem is formulated as\na constrained stochastic programming problem. The Lyapunov optimization\ntechnique is then applied to derive an adaptive electricity scheduling\nalgorithm by introducing the QoSE virtual queues and energy storage virtual\nqueues. The proposed algorithm is an online algorithm since it does not require\nany statistics and future knowledge of the electricity supply, demand and price\nprocesses. We derive several \"hard\" performance bounds for the proposed\nalgorithm, and evaluate its performance with trace-driven simulations. The\nsimulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed electricity\nscheduling algorithm.\n","Comment: 12 pages, extended technical report"]}]

This\ngives a partial answer to a question of D. Banaszewski. We also show that every\nextendable function g:R-->R with a dense graph satisfies the following stronger\nversion of the SCIVP property: for every a<b and every perfect set K between\ng(a) and g(b) there is a perfect subset C of (a,b) such that g[C] subset K and\ng|C is continuous strictly increasing. This property is used to construct a ZFC\nexample of an additive almost continuous function f:R-->R which has the strong\nCantor intermediate value property but is not extendable. This answers a\nquestion of H. Rosen. This also generalizes Rosen's result that a similar (but\nnot additive) function exists under the assumption of the continuum hypothesis.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]

First, we continue the investigations\nstarted in Judah, Roslanowski and Shelah \\math.LO/9310224 and Roslanowski and\nShelah math.LO/9807172, math.LO/9703222, and we investigate the method of norms\non possibilities in the context of ccc forcing notions, getting a number of\nconstructions of nicely definable ccc forcings. The second theme of the paper\nis a part of the general program ``how special are random and Cohen forcing\nnotions (or: the respective ideals)''. Shelah math.LO/9303208 shows that the\ntwo forcing notions may occupy special positions in the realm of nicely\ndefinable forcing notions. In this realm we may classify forcing notions using\nthe methods of Shelah [Sh:630] (math.LO/9712283), [Sh:669] and, for example,\ndeclare that very Souslin (or generally omega-nw-nep) ccc forcing notions are\nreally nice. Both the Cohen forcing notion and the random forcing notion and\ntheir FS iterations (and nice subforcings) are all ccc omega-nw-nep, and\nProblem 4.24 of math.LO/9906113 asked if we have more examples. It occurs that\nour method relatively easily results in very Souslin ccc forcing notions. The\nthird theme is Sweet & Sour, and it is related to one of the most striking\ndifferences between the random and the Cohen forcing notions that appears when\nwe consider the respective regularity properties of projective sets: the\nLebesgue measurability of Sigma^1_3 sets implies aleph_1 is inaccessible in L,\nwhile one can construct (in ZFC) a forcing notion P which forces ``projective\nsubsets of R have the Baire property'' (see Shelah [Sh:176]).\n"]}]
