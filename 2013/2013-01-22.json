The\ninformation-theoretic lower bound on the number of comparisons needed in the\nworst case is log e(P), the binary logarithm of the number of linear extensions\nof P. In a breakthrough paper, Jeff Kahn and Jeong Han Kim (J. Comput. System\nSci. 51 (3), 390-399, 1995) showed that there exists a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for the problem achieving this bound up to a constant factor. Their\nalgorithm invokes the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration for determining the\nnext comparison, making it impractical.\n  We develop efficient algorithms for sorting under partial information. Like\nKahn and Kim, our approach relies on graph entropy. However, our algorithms\ndiffer in essential ways from theirs. Rather than resorting to convex\nprogramming for computing the entropy, we approximate the entropy, or make sure\nit is computed only once, in a restricted class of graphs, permitting the use\nof a simpler algorithm. Specifically, we present:\n  - an O(n^2) algorithm performing O(log n log e(P)) comparisons;\n  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing at most (1+ epsilon) log e(P) + O_epsilon\n(n) comparisons;\n  - an O(n^2.5) algorithm performing O(log e(P)) comparisons.\n  All our algorithms can be implemented in such a way that their computational\nbottleneck is confined in a preprocessing phase, while the sorting phase is\ncompleted in O(q) + O(n) time, where q denotes the number of comparisons\nperformed.\n","Comment: v3: Minor changes.

The problem that we address is that\nDNA-functionalised colloids typically crystallize in a narrow temperature\nwindow, if at all. The underlying reason is the extreme sensitivity of\nDNA-mediated interactions to temperature or other physical control parameters.\nWe propose to widen the window for colloidal crystallization by exploiting the\ncompetition between DNA linkages with different nucleotide sequences, which\nresults in a temperature-dependent switching of the dominant bond type.\nFollowing such a strategy, we can decrease the temperature dependence of\nDNA-mediated self assembly to make systems that can crystallize in a wider\ntemperature window than is possible with existing systems of DNA functionalised\ncolloids. We report Monte Carlo simulations that show that the proposed\nstrategy can indeed work in practice for real systems and specific, designable\nDNA sequences. Depending on the length ratio of the different DNA constructs,\nwe find that the bond switching is either energetically driven (equal length or\n`symmetric' DNA) or controlled by a combinatorial entropy gain (`asymmetric'\nDNA), which results from the large number of possible binding partners for each\nDNA strand.

Each vertex in the network has three edges incident upon it,\nwhich are colored red, blue and green. This edge coloring is done to provide a\nway for the writer to orient its movement. We explore the dynamics of a space\nof 3888 of these `colored trinet automata' systems. We find a large variety of\nbehaviour, ranging from the very simple to the very complex. We also discover\nsimple rules that generate forms which are remarkably similar to a wide range\nof natural objects. We study our systems using simulations (with appropriate\nvisualization techniques) and analyze selected rules mathematically.

However, it has been argued that the production\nof large-scale magnetic fields by mean-field dynamo action is strongly\nsuppressed at large magnetic Reynolds numbers owing to the conservation of\nmagnetic helicity. This phenomenon is known as {\\it catastrophic quenching}.\nAdvection of magnetic fields by stellar and galactic winds toward the outer\nboundaries and away from the dynamo is expected to alleviate such quenching.\nHere we explore the relative roles played by advective and turbulent--diffusive\nfluxes of magnetic helicity in the dynamo. In particular, we study how the\ndynamo is affected by advection. We do this by performing direct numerical\nsimulations of a turbulent dynamo of $\\alpha^2$ type driven by forced\nturbulence in a Cartesian domain in the presence of a flow away from the\nequator where helicity changes sign. Our results indicate that in the presence\nof advection, the dynamo, otherwise stationary, becomes oscillatory.

The\ncontradiction requires the MacDonald treatment of both non-resonant and\nresonant rotation to be rewritten.\n  The non-resonant case was reconsidered by Efroimsky & Williams (2009; CMDA\n104, 257), in application to spin modes distant from the major\ncommensurabilities.

The universal constant a0 turns out to have an\nintriguing connection with cosmology: \\bar a0 == 2 pi a0 \\approx c H_0 \\approx\nc^2(Lambda/3)^{1/2}.

The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,\nrange, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a\nchallenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of\nphysical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting\nexploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied\ncross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac\nstandard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge\nbetween PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in\ncollision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly\ninvolved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC\nmechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such\nfunctionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac\nspecifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for\nthe IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output\n(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,\nneeds both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented\ncross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it\nwith the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate\nthe 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO\nsolutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel\nsounding interval has particularly been studied.

Parts of these properties are\nrecovered by the \"Lomb-Scargle\" (LS) technique, but at the price of theoretical\ndifficulties, that can make its use unclear, and of algorithms that require the\ndevelopment of dedicated software if a fast implementation is necessary. Such\nproblems would be irrelevant if the LS periodogram could be used to\nsignificantly improve the results obtained by approximated but simpler\ntechniques. In this work we show that in many astronomical applications simpler\ntechniques provide results similar to those obtainable with the LS periodogram.\nThe meaning of the \"Nyquist frequency\" is also discussed in the case of\nirregular sampling.\n"]}]

There are many logical\nsystems, and many ways of formalizing them, e.g., using natural deduction or\nsequent calculus. Calculus of structures (CoS) is a new formalism proposed by\nAlessio Guglielmi in 2004 that generalizes sequent calculus in the sense that\ninference rules can be applied at any depth inside a formula, rather than only\nto the main connective. With this feature, proofs in CoS are shorter than in\nany other formalism supporting analytical proofs. Although it is great to have\nthe freedom and expressiveness of CoS, under the point of view of proof search\nmore freedom means a larger search space. And that should be restricted when\nlooking for complete automation of deductive systems. Some efforts were made to\nreduce this non-determinism, but they are all basically operational approaches,\nand no solid theoretical result regarding the computational behaviour of CoS\nhas been achieved so far. The main focus of this thesis is to discuss ways to\npropose a proof search strategy for CoS suitable to implementation. This\nstrategy should be theoretical instead of purely operational. We introduce the\nconcept of incoherence number of substructures inside structures and we use\nthis concept to achieve our main result: there is an algorithm that, according\nto our conjecture, corresponds to a proof search strategy to every provable\nstructure in the subsystem of FBV (the multiplicative linear logic MLL plus the\nrule mix) containing only pairwise distinct atoms.
