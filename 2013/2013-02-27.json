Gravitational wave\ndetection using space based detectors and Pulsar Timing Arrays bring with them\nthe additional challenge of having to isolate individual signals that overlap\none another in both time and frequency. Promising solutions to these problems\nwill be discussed, along with some of the challenges that remain.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 3 figures.

Nevertheless if\none focuses on the regime around the dynamical transition in three dimensions,\nMode-Coupling results are far more convincing than replica theory predictions.\nIt seems thus necessary to reconcile the two theoretic approaches in order to\nobtain a theory that interpolates between low-dimensional, Mode-Coupling\nresults, and \"mean-field\" results from replica theory. Even though quantitative\nresults for the dynamical transition issued from replica theory are not\naccurate in low dimensions, two different approximation schemes --small cage\nexpansion and replicated Hyper-Netted-Chain (RHNC)-- provide the correct\nqualitative picture for the transition, namely a discontinuous jump of a static\norder parameter from zero to a finite value. The purpose of this work is to\ndevelop a systematic expansion around the RHNC result in powers of the static\norder parameter, and to calculate the first correction in this expansion.\nInterestingly, this correction involves the static three-body correlations of\nthe liquid. More importantly, we separately demonstrate that higher order terms\nin the expansion are quantitatively relevant at the transition, and that the\nusual mode-coupling kernel, involving two-body direct correlation functions of\nthe liquid, cannot be recovered from static computations.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, contribution to a J.

It is based upon the gauge-invariant\ntheory of the Lagrangian perturbations of cosmological manifold caused by an\nisolated astronomical N-body system. We postulate that the background manifold\nis described by Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric governed by\ntwo primary components - the dark matter and the dark energy. The dark matter\nis treated as an ideal fluid. The dark energy is described by a single scalar\nfield with a potential which is hold unspecified as long as the theory permits.\nThe Lagrangian of the dark matter and that of the scalar field are formulated\nin terms of the field variables. We use variational calculus to derive the\ngauge-invariant field equations of the post-Newtonian celestial mechanics of an\nisolated astronomical system in an expanding universe. These equations\ngeneralize the field equations of the post-Newtonian theory in\nasymptotically-flat spacetime by taking into account the cosmological effects\nexplicitly. We introduce a new cosmological gauge which generalizes the\nharmonic gauge of the post-Newtonian theory in asymptotically-flat spacetime.\nThis gauge significantly simplifies the gravitational field equations and\nallows finding out the approximations where the field equations can be fully\ndecoupled and solved analytically. The residual gauge freedom is explored. The\nresults of the present paper can be useful in the solar system for calculating\nmore precise ephemerides of the solar system bodies on extremely long time\nintervals, in galactic astronomy to study the dynamics of clusters of galaxies,\nand in gravitational wave astronomy for discussing the impact of cosmology on\ngeneration and propagation of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing\nbinaries and/or merging galactic nuclei.\n","Comment: 59 pages, accepted to Physical Review D"]}]

We\npropose an alternative construction of the spacetime manifold which naturally\nenables time anisotropy. We promote the role of curvature: the Ricci scalar R\nat a given point sets the length scales for physical processes - including\ngravity - in the local inertial frames enclosing that point. The manifold is a\npatchwork of local regions; each region is Lorentz invariant and adopts a local\nscale a_R defined as a_R = 1/sqrt|R|. In each local patch, the length scales of\nphysical processes are measured relatively to a_R, and only their dimensionless\nratios partake in the dynamics of physical processes. Time anisotropy arises by\nrequiring that the form - but not necessarily the parameters - of physical laws\nbe unchanged under variations of the local a_R as one moves on the manifold.\nThe time scaling is found to be dt ~ a_R^(3/2) whereas the spatial part scales\nas dx ~ a_R.\n  We show how to conjoin the local patches of the manifold in a way which\nrespects causality and special relativity, as well as the equivalence and\ngeneral covariance principles.

The Fourier transform of a narrow-band signal, with a\ndiscontinuous amplitude and/or phase function, exhibits spectral and temporal\nspreading. The proposed method aims to avoid such spreading by explicitly\nmodeling the signal of interest as a sum of sinusoids with time-varying\namplitudes. So as to accommodate abrupt changes, it is further assumed that the\namplitude/phase functions are approximately piecewise constant (i.e., their\ntime-derivatives are sparse).
