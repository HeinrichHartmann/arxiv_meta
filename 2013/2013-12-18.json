First we present the numerical method for the resolution of\nthe Shallow Water equations integrated in FullSWOF_2D (the two-dimension\nversion). This method is based on hydrostatic reconstruction scheme, coupled\nwith a semi-implicit friction term treatment. FullSWOF_2D has been previously\nvalidated using analytical solutions from the SWASHES library (Shallow Water\nAnalytic Solutions for Hydraulic and Environmental Studies). Finally,\nFullSWOF_2D is run on a real topography measured on a runoff plot located in\nThies (Senegal). Simulation results are compared with measured data. This\nexperimental benchmark demonstrate the capabilities of FullSWOF to simulate\nadequately overland flow. FullSWOF could also be used for other environmental\nissues, such as river floods and dam-breaks.\n","Comment: 9 pages"]}]

The Galactic chemical evolution of sulphur is still under debate.

To contribute to the discussion on the Galactic chemical evolution of\nsulphur by deriving sulphur abundances from non-LTE insensitive spectral\ndiagnostics in Disk and Halo stars with homogeneously determined stellar\nparameters.\n  Methods. We derive Teff from photometric colours, logg from stellar\nisochrones and Bayesian estimation, and [Fe/H] and [S/Fe] from spectrum\nsynthesis.

We find the [S i] line to be a valuable diagnostic of sulphur\nabundances in cool giants down to [Fe/H] ~ -2.3. We argue that a homogeneous\ndetermination of stellar parameters is necessary, since the derived abundances\nare sensitive to them. Our results ([S/Fe]) show reasonable agreement with\npredictions of contemporary models of Galactic chemical evolution.

The derived photometric redshifts\nhave errors nearly independent of distance, with an all-sky accuracy of\nsigma_z=0.015 and a very small percentage of outliers. In this way, we obtain\nredshift estimates with a typical precision of 12% for all the 2MASS XSC\ngalaxies that lack spectroscopy. In addition, we have made an early effort\ntowards probing the entire 3D sky beyond 2MASS, by pairing up WISE with\nSuperCOSMOS and training the ANNz on GAMA redshift data reaching currently to\nz_med~0.2. This has yielded photo-z accuracies comparable to those in the 2MPZ.\nThese all-sky photo-z catalogs, with a median z~0.1 for the 2MPZ, and\nsignificantly deeper for future WISE-based samples, will be the largest and\nmost complete of their kind for the foreseeable future.\n","Comment: The most recent version of the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalog is\n  available for download from http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/ssa/TWOMPZ"]}]

By\nfitting the level spacing distributions, deformed random matrix ensembles which\nmodel multifractality of the wave functions typical of the Anderson\nlocalization transition, are shown to provide an excellent effective\ndescription for such a critical statistics.

These viscoelastic models are such that the\nattenuation is frequency dependent and follows a power law with non-integer\nexponent. As a prototypical example, the Andrade model is chosen for its\nsimplicity and its satisfactory fits of experimental flow laws in rocks and\nmetals. The corresponding constitutive equation features a fractional\nderivative in time, a non-local term that can be expressed as a convolution\nproduct which direct implementation bears substantial memory cost. To\ncircumvent this limitation, a diffusive representation approach is deployed,\nreplacing the convolution product by an integral of a function satisfying a\nlocal time-domain ordinary differential equation. An associated quadrature\nformula yields a local-in-time system of partial differential equations, which\nis then proven to be well-posed. The properties of the resulting model are also\ncompared to those of the original Andrade model. The quadrature scheme\nassociated with the diffusive approximation, and constructed either from a\nclassical polynomial approach or from a constrained optimization method, is\ninvestigated to finally highlight the benefits of using the latter approach.\nWave propagation simulations in homogeneous domains are performed within a\nsplit formulation framework that yields an optimal stability condition and\nwhich features a joint fourth-order time-marching scheme coupled with an exact\nintegration step. A set of numerical experiments is presented to assess the\nefficiency of the diffusive approximation method for such wave propagation\nproblems.\n","Comment: submitted to Wave Motion"]}]

With respect to the slepton sector, we explore the implications on\ncharged lepton flavour violating (LFV) processes. The present upper bounds on\nthe most relevant LFV processes and the recent LHC and (g-2)_mu data lead to\nupdated constraints on all slepton flavour mixing parameters. We also study the\nLFV Higgs decays h,H, A -> tau mu considering the relevant types of slepton\nmixing (LL23, LR23, RL23, RR23) in the context of a heavy SUSY with a scale\ninto the multi-TeV range. These observables present a non-decoupling behaviour\nwith mSUSY, and are shown here to remain constant as mSUSY grows, for large\nmSUSY> 2 TeV values and for all the mixings considered. We show that all the\nthree channels could be measurable at the LHC even in these heavy SUSY\nscenarios, being h -> tau mu the most promising one, with up to about hundred\nof events expected with the current LHC centre-of-mass energy and luminosity.\nThe most promising predictions for the future LHC stage are also included.\n","Comment: PhD.
