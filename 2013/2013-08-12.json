To investigate seismic wave amplification in such cases, past studies\nhave been devoted to one-directional shear wave propagation in a soil column\n(1D-propagation) considering one motion component only (1C-polarization). Three\nindependent purely 1C computations may be performed ('1D-1C' approach) and\ndirectly superimposed in the case of weak motions (linear behaviour). This\nresearch aims at studying local site effects by considering seismic wave\npropagation in a 1-D soil profile accounting for the influence of the 3-D\nloading path and non-linear hysteretic behaviour of the soil. In the proposed\n'1D-3C' approach, the three components (3C-polarization) of the incident wave\nare simultaneously propagated into a horizontal multilayered soil. A 3-D\nnon-linear constitutive relation for the soil is implemented in the framework\nof the Finite Element Method in the time domain. The complex rheology of soils\nis modelled by mean of a multisurface cyclic plasticity model of the\nMasing-Prandtl-Ishlinskii-Iwan type. The great advantage of this choice is that\nthe only data needed to describe the model is the modulus reduction curve. A\nparametric study is carried out to characterize the changes in the seismic\nmotion of the surficial layers due to both incident wavefield properties and\nsoil non-linearities. The numerical simulations show a seismic response\ndepending on several parameters such as polarization of seismic waves, material\nelastic and dynamic properties, as well as on the impedance contrast between\nlayers and frequency content and oscillatory character of the input motion. The\n3-D loading path due to the 3C-polarization leads to multi-axial stress\ninteraction that reduces soil strength and increases non-linear effects. The\nnon-linear behaviour of the soil may have beneficial or detrimental effects on\nthe seismic response at the free surface, depending on the energy dissipation\nrate. Free surface time histories, stress-strain hysteresis loops and in-depth\nprofiles of octahedral stress and strain are estimated for each soil column.\nThe combination of three separate 1D-1C non-linear analyses is compared to the\nproposed 1D-3C approach, evidencing the influence of the 3C-polarization and\nthe 3-D loading path on strong seismic motions.\n"]}]

Most of the\nexisting results make crucial use of dissipative conditions. Dealing with \"pure\ndelay\" systems in which both the drift and the diffusion coefficients depend\nonly on the arguments with delays, the existing results become not applicable.\nThis work uses a variation-of-constants formula to overcome the difficulties\ndue to the lack of the information at the current time. This paper establishes\nexistence and uniqueness of stationary distributions for retarded SDEs that\nneed not satisfy dissipative conditions. The retarded SDEs considered in this\npaper also cover SDEs of neutral type and SDEs driven by L\\'{e}vy processes\nthat might not admit finite second moments.\n","Comment: page 20"]}]
