We find that, regardless of\nthe details of the equipartition scenario considered, the energy required to\nproduce the observed radio (i.e., energy in magnetic field and radio emitting\nelectrons) must increase by a factor of ~20 during the first 200 days. It then\nsaturates. This energy increase cannot be alleviated by a varying geometry of\nthe system. The radio data can be explained by: (i) An afterglow like emission\nof the X-ray emitting narrow relativistic jet. The additional energy can arise\nhere from a slower moving material ejected in the first few days that gradually\ncatches up with the slowing down blast wave (Berger et al. 2012). However, this\nrequires at least ~4x10^{53} erg in the slower moving outflow. This is much\nmore than the energy of the fast moving outflow that produced the early X-rays\nand it severely constrains the overall energy budget. (ii) Alternatively, the\nradio may arise from a mildly relativistic quasi-spherical outflow. Here, the\nenergy for the radio emission increases with time to at least ~10^{51} erg\nafter 200 days. This scenario requires, however, a second X-ray emitting\ncollimated relativistic component. Given these results, it is worthwhile to\nconsider models in which the energy of the magnetic field and/or of the radio\nemitting electrons increases with time without a continuous energy supply to\nthe blast wave. This can happen, for example, if the energy is injected\ninitially mostly in one form (Poynting flux or baryonic) and it is gradually\nconverted to the other form, leading to a deviation from equipartition. Another\nintriguing possibility is that a gradually decreasing Inverse Compton cooling\nmodifies the synchrotron emission and leads to an increase of the available\nenergy in the radio emitting electrons (Kumar et al. 2013).\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, two-column format.

Such systems are characterized by\nintermittent behavior, where slow buildup of energy is punctuated by an abrupt\nrelease of energy through avalanche events which usually follow scale invariant\nstatistics. From the simulations of these systems it is possible to extract\nsequences of record-breaking avalanches, where each subsequent record-breaking\nevent is larger in magnitude than all previous events. In the present work,\nseveral cellular automata are analyzed among them the sandpile model, Manna\nmodel, Olami-Feder-Christensen (OFC) model, and the forest-fire model to\ninvestigate the record-breaking statistics of model avalanches which exhibit\ntemporal and spatial correlations. Several statistical measures of\nrecord-breaking events are derived analytically and confirmed through numerical\nsimulations. The statistics of record-breaking avalanches for the four models\nare compared to that of record-breaking events extracted from the sequences of\nindependent identically distributed (\\emph{i.i.d.}) random variables. It is\nfound that the statistics of record-breaking avalanches for the above cellular\nautomata exhibit behavior different from that observed for \\emph{i.i.d.} random\nvariables which in turn can be used to characterize complex spatio-temporal\ndynamics. The most pronounced deviations are observed in the case of the OFC\nmodel with a strong dependence on the conservation parameter of the model.

Interstellar ice is the main form of metal species in dark molecular\nclouds. Experiments and observations have shown that the ice is significantly\nprocessed after the freeze-out of molecules onto grains. The processing is\ncaused by cosmic-ray particles and cosmic-ray-induced UV photons. These\ntransformations are included in current astrochemical models only to a very\nlimited degree. Aims. We aim to establish a model of the \"cold\" chemistry in\ninterstellar ices and to evaluate its general impact on the composition of\ninterstellar ices. Methods. The ice was treated as consisting of two layers -\nthe surface and the mantle (or subsurface) layer. Subsurface chemical processes\nare described with photodissociation of ice species and binary reactions on the\nsurfaces of cavities inside the mantle. Hydrogen atoms and molecules can\ndiffuse between the layers. We also included deuterium chemistry. Results. The\nmodeling results show that the content of chemically bound H is reduced in\nsubsurface molecules by about 30 % on average. This promotes the formation of\nmore hydrogen-poor species in the ice. The enrichment of ice molecules with\ndeuterium is significantly reduced by the subsurface processes. On average, it\nfollows the gas-phase atomic D-to-H abundance ratio, with a delay. The delay\nproduced by the model is on the order of several Myr. Conclusions. The\nprocessing of ice may place new constraints on the production of deuterated\nspecies on grains. In a mantle with a two-layer structure the upper layer (CO)\nshould be processed substantially more intensively than the lower layer (H2O).\nChemical explosions in interstellar ice might not be an important process. They\ndestroy the structure of the mantle, which forms over long timescales. Besides,\nices may lack the high radical content needed for the explosions.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, 94 references"]}]

This can only be done\nfor a restricted set of copulas, e.g. a normal copula. Our article introduces\ncopula-type estimators for flexible multivariate density estimation which also\nallow the marginal densities to be modeled separately from the joint\ndependence, as in copula modeling, but overcomes the lack of flexibility of\nmost popular copula estimators. An iterative scheme is proposed for estimating\ncopula-type estimators and its usefulness is demonstrated through simulation\nand real examples. The joint dependence is is modeled by mixture of normals and\nmixture of normals factor analyzers models, and mixture of t and mixture of t\nfactor analyzers models. We develop efficient Variational Bayes algorithms for\nfitting these in which model selection is performed automatically. Based on\nthese mixture models, we construct four classes of copula-type densities which\nare far more flexible than current popular copula densities, and outperform\nthem in simulation and several real data sets.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 3 figures"]}]

To simplify the definition of the weight, we use\nmatrices of symmetric (possibly colored) operads that define some auxiliary\ncategories and 2-categories. Systematic use of these matrices of operads allows\nus to define several similar objects as weighted limits.

As a corollary the same conclusion holds for\nsupersingular Fermat threefolds. In contrast, using methods of C.
