This data is usually stored in database. A major consideration\nis applied on the security of that data from the unauthorized access and\nintruders. Data encryption is a strong option for security of data in database\nand especially in those organizations where security risks are high. But there\nis a potential disadvantage of performance degradation. When we apply\nencryption on database then we should compromise between the security and\nefficient query processing. The work of this paper tries to fill this gap. It\nallows the users to query over the encrypted column directly without decrypting\nall the records. It's improves the performance of the system. The proposed\nalgorithm works well in the case of range and fuzzy match queries.\n","Comment: 4 Pages, 2 Figures, 2 Tables Published With \"International Journal of\n  Computer Applications (IJCA)\""]}]

Shannon information rate, or bit rate, of the\nsignals may not be uniformly distributed. When the program is specified by a\nfinite state transition system, algorithms are provided in identifying\ninformation-rich components. For a black-box program that has a partial\nspecification or does not even have a specification, a bit rate signal and its\nspectrum are studied, which make use of data compression and the Fourier\ntransform. The signal provides a bit-rate coverage for testing the black-box\nwhile its spectrum indicates a visual representation for execution's\ninformation characteristics.\n"]}]
