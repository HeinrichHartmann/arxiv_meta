F1000 aims to recommend important publications in the biomedical\nliterature, and from this perspective F1000 could be an interesting tool for\nresearch evaluation. By linking the complete database of F1000 recommendations\nto the Web of Science bibliographic database, we are able to make a\ncomprehensive comparison between F1000 recommendations and citations. We find\nthat about 2% of the publications in the biomedical literature receive at least\none F1000 recommendation. Recommended publications on average receive 1.30\nrecommendations, and over 90% of the recommendations are given within half a\nyear after a publication has appeared. There turns out to be a clear\ncorrelation between F1000 recommendations and citations. However, the\ncorrelation is relatively weak, at least weaker than the correlation between\njournal impact and citations. More research is needed to identify the main\nreasons for differences between recommendations and citations in assessing the\nimpact of publications.\n"]}]

In this paper, we generalize this method to the\non-line identification of fractional order systems based on the\nRiemann-Liouville fractional derivatives. First, a new fractional integration\nby parts formula involving the fractional derivative of a modulating function\nis given. Then, we apply this formula to a fractional order system, for which\nthe fractional derivatives of the input and the output can be transferred into\nthe ones of the modulating functions. By choosing a set of modulating\nfunctions, a linear system of algebraic equations is obtained. Hence, the\nunknown parameters of a fractional order system can be estimated by solving a\nlinear system. Using this method, we do not need any initial values which are\nusually unknown and not equal to zero. Also we do not need to estimate the\nfractional derivatives of noisy output. Moreover, it is shown that the proposed\nestimators are robust against high frequency sinusoidal noises and the ones due\nto a class of stochastic processes. Finally, the efficiency and the stability\nof the proposed method is confirmed by some numerical simulations.\n"]}]

A\nparticular emphasis was given to the study of the equimolar mixture of\naluminium chloride with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, which forms a\nroom temperature ionic liquid EMI-AlCl 4. The structure yielded by the\nclassical simulations performed within the framework of the polarizable ion\nmodel is compared to the results obtained from entirely electronic\nstructure-based simulations: An excellent agreement between the two flavors of\nmolecular dynamics is observed. When changing the organic cation EMI+ by an\ninorganic cation with a smaller ionic radius (Li+, Na+, K+), the\nchloroaluminate speciation becomes more complex, with the formation of Al2Cl 7-\nin small amounts. The calculated transport properties (diffusion coefficients,\nelectrical conductivity and viscosity) of EMI-AlCl4 are in good agreement with\nexperimental data.\n"]}]
