Electromagnetic forcing is applied to induce\nflow in a layer of fluid of constant depth. Continuously forced as well as\ndecaying flows are investigated. Optical altimetry is used to measure the\ngradient of the surface elevation field and to obtain the velocity and\nvorticity fields with high temporal and spatial resolution. Spectral analysis\nof the flows demonstrates the formation of dual cascade with energy and\nenstrophy intervals although the corresponding spectral fluxes of energy and\nenstrophy are not uniform in these intervals. The energy interval is\ncharacterized by the slope of approximately -5/3 in terms of wavenumber and is\nlimited in extent by the finite radius of deformation effect. In the enstrophy\nrange, the slope is steeper than -3 due to the presence of long-lived coherent\nvortices. The spatial patterns of spectral fluxes in the flow indicate that\ninverse energy transfer and direct enstrophy transfer occur mainly in elongated\nvorticity patches. Cyclone/anticyclone asymmetry in favor of anticyclones is\nobserved in our flows. Dominance of anticyclones is most clear during the decay\nphase of turbulence. The anticyclones remain circular while cyclonic vorticity\nis stretched into elongated patches. Measurements show that skewness of\nvorticity distribution increases with increasing Froude number of the flow.\nInertial and Kelvin waves are detected in our experiments; their\ncharacteristics are analysed against the appropriate dispersion relations.\n","Comment: 61 pages, 16 figures"]}]

The\ndamping of the surface plasmon polariton originates from the resonant\nabsorption by the electrons (Landau damping), and the corresponding damping\nexhibits size-dependent oscillations and distinct temperature dependence\nwithout any scattering. The scattering influences the damping by introducing a\nbroadening and a shifting to the resonance. To demonstrate this, we investigate\nthe damping of the surface plasmon polariton in InAs nanowires in the presence\nof the electron-impurity, electron-phonon and electron-electron Coulomb\nscatterings. The main effect of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon\nscatterings is to introduce a broadening, whereas the electron-electron Coulomb\nscattering can not only cause a broadening, but also introduce a shifting to\nthe resonance. For InAs nanowires under investigation, the broadening due to\nthe electron-phonon scattering dominates. As a result, the scattering has a\npronounced influence on the damping of the surface plasmon polariton: The\nsize-dependent oscillations are smeared out and the temperature dependence is\nalso suppressed in the presence of the scattering. These results demonstrate\nthe the important role of the scattering on the surface plasmon polariton\ndamping in semiconductor nanowires.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 11 figures"]}]

RUM's\narchitecture is composed of three layers: representation, inference, and\ncontrol. The representation layer is based on frame-like data structures that\ncapture the uncertainty information used in the inference layer and the\nuncertainty meta-information used in the control layer. The inference layer\nprovides a selection of five T-norm based uncertainty calculi with which to\nperform the intersection, detachment, union, and pooling of information. The\ncontrol layer uses the meta-information to select the appropriate calculus for\neach context and to resolve eventual ignorance or conflict in the information.\nThis layer also provides a context mechanism that allows the system to focus on\nthe relevant portion of the knowledge base, and an uncertain-belief revision\nsystem that incrementally updates the certainty values of well-formed formulae\n(wffs) in an acyclic directed deduction graph. RUM has been tested and\nvalidated in a sequence of experiments in both naval and aerial situation\nassessment (SA), consisting of correlating reports and tracks, locating and\nclassifying platforms, and identifying intents and threats. An example of naval\nsituation assessment is illustrated. The testbed environment for developing\nthese experiments has been provided by LOTTA, a symbolic simulator implemented\nin Flavors. This simulator maintains time-varying situations in a multi-player\nantagonistic game where players must make decisions in light of uncertain and\nincomplete data. RUM has been used to assist one of the LOTTA players to\nperform the SA task.\n","Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Third Conference on Uncertainty in\n  Artificial Intelligence (UAI1987)"]}]

In order to evaluate combination of evidence for this\nsystem, using observed data, auxiliary at tribute and diagnosis variables, and\ninference rules connecting them, one must first choose an appropriate algebraic\nlogic description pair (ALDP): a formal language or syntax followed by a\ncompatible logic or semantic evaluation (or model). Three common choices- for\nthis highly non-unique choice - are briefly discussed, the logics being\nClassical Logic, Fuzzy Logic, and Probability Logic. In all three,the key\noperator representing implication for the inference rules is interpreted as the\noften-used disjunction of a negation (b => a) = (b'v a), for any events a,b.\n  However, another reasonable interpretation of the implication operator is\nthrough the familiar form of probabilistic conditioning. But, it can be shown -\nquite surprisingly - that the ALDP corresponding to Probability Logic cannot be\nused as a rigorous basis for this interpretation! To fill this gap, a new ALDP\nis constructed consisting of \"conditional objects\", extending ordinary\nProbability Logic, and compatible with the desired conditional probability\ninterpretation of inference rules.

Our method and setting differs from many\nstochastic optimization approaches in two principal ways. Firstly, we assume\nthat the value of the function itself can be computed without noise, in other\nwords, that the function is deterministic. Secondly, we use random models of\nhigher quality than those produced by usual stochastic gradient methods. In\nparticular, a first order model based on random approximation of the gradient\nis required to provide sufficient quality of approximation with probability\ngreater than or equal to 1/2. This is in contrast with stochastic gradient\napproaches, where the model is assumed to be \"correct\" only in expectation. As\na result of this particular setting, we are able to prove convergence, with\nprobability one, of a trust-region method which is almost identical to the\nclassical method. Hence we show that a standard optimization framework can be\nused in cases when models are random and may or may not provide good\napproximations, as long as \"good\" models are more likely than \"bad\" models. Our\nresults are based on the use of properties of martingales. Our motivation comes\nfrom using random sample sets and interpolation models in derivative-free\noptimization.

In this paper we report results from a two-year long campaign\nof experiments on three species of ants and one species of (tephritid) fruit\nflies. In these experiments individuals were separated from their colony and\nkept in isolation either alone or in groups of 10 individuals.
