Specifically, we\nstudy a five-dimensional model cosmology in type IIB supergravity, where the\ndual theory is an unstable deformation of $\\N=4$ supersymmetric SU(N) gauge\ntheory on $\\Rbar\\times S^3$. A one-loop computation shows that the coupling\ngoverning the instability is asymptotically free, so quantum corrections cannot\nturn the potential around. The big crunch singularity in the bulk occurs when a\nboundary scalar field runs to infinity, in finite time. Consistent quantum\nevolution requires that we impose boundary conditions at infinite scalar field,\ni.e. a self-adjoint extension of the system. We find that quantum spreading of\nthe homogeneous mode of the boundary scalar leads to a natural UV cutoff in\nparticle production as the wavefunction for the homogeneous mode bounces back\nfrom infinity. However a perturbative calculation indicates that despite this,\nthe logarithmic running of the boundary coupling governing the instability\ngenerally leads to significant particle production across the bounce. This\nprevents the wave packet of the homogeneous boundary scalar to return close to\nits initial form. Translating back to the bulk theory, we conclude that a\nquantum transition from a big crunch to a big bang is an improbable outcome of\ncosmological evolution in this class of five-dimensional models.\n","Comment: 91 pages, 24 figures; v2: minor reorganization of introduction,\n  clarifying comments throughout; 77 pages, 22 figures;v5: error corrected\n  which significantly changes conclusion"]}]

One major problem in studying\nlight-harvesting complexes has been the lack of an efficient method for\nsimulation of their dynamics in biological environments. To this end, here we\nrevisit the second-order time-convolution (TC2) master equation and examine its\nreliability beyond extreme Markovian and perturbative limits.

We integrate numerically the full exact growth rate equations\nfor the flat and curved cases. We find that for the matter-dominated era, the\nSzekeres growth rate is up to a factor of three to five stronger than the usual\nlinearly perturbed FLRW cases, reflecting the effect of exact Szekeres\nnon-linear perturbations. The growth is also stronger than that of the\nnon-linear spherical collapse model, and the difference between the two\nincreases with time.

When the\ndeformation is carefully removed, this 4D locality (with plausible technical\nassumptions specifying its precise nature) combines with the restored conformal\nsymmetry to yield 5D AdS locality. The sense in which AdS/CFT duality\nillustrates the possibility of emergent relativity, and the special role of\nstrong coupling, are briefly discussed. Care is taken to conclude each step\nwith well-defined mathematical expressions and convergent integrals.\n","Comment: 66 pages.

Rather\nthan focus on one or more stable dark-matter particles, we instead consider a\nmulti-component framework in which the dark matter of the universe comprises a\nvast ensemble of interacting fields with a variety of different masses,\nmixings, and abundances. Moreover, rather than impose stability for each field\nindividually, we ensure the phenomenological viability of such a scenario by\nrequiring that those states with larger masses and Standard-Model decay widths\nhave correspondingly smaller relic abundances, and vice versa. In other words,\ndark-matter stability is not an absolute requirement in such a framework, but\nis balanced against abundance. This leads to a highly dynamical scenario in\nwhich cosmological quantities such as Omega_{CDM} experience non-trivial\ntime-dependences beyond those associated with the expansion of the universe.\nAlthough it may seem difficult to arrange an ensemble of states which have the\nrequired decay widths and relic abundances, we present one particular example\nin which this balancing act occurs naturally: an infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein\n(KK) states living in the bulk of large extra spacetime dimensions. Remarkably,\nthis remains true even if the stability of the KK tower itself is entirely\nunprotected. Thus theories with large extra dimensions --- and by extension,\ncertain limits of string theory --- naturally give rise to dynamical dark\nmatter.

An Explicit Model"],"description":["  In a recent paper (arXiv:1106.4546), we introduced \"dynamical dark matter,\" a\nnew framework for dark-matter physics, and outlined its underlying theoretical\nprinciples and phenomenological possibilities. Unlike most traditional\napproaches to the dark-matter problem which hypothesize the existence of one or\nmore stable dark-matter particles, our dynamical dark-matter framework is\ncharacterized by the fact that the requirement of stability is replaced by a\ndelicate balancing between cosmological abundances and lifetimes across a vast\nensemble of individual dark-matter components. This setup therefore\ncollectively produces a time-varying cosmological dark-matter abundance, and\nthe different dark-matter components can interact and decay throughout the\ncurrent epoch. While the goal of our previous paper was to introduce the broad\ntheoretical aspects of this framework, the purpose of the current paper is to\nprovide an explicit model of dynamical dark matter and demonstrate that this\nmodel satisfies all collider, astrophysical, and cosmological constraints. The\nresults of this paper therefore constitute an \"existence proof\" of the\nphenomenological viability of our overall dynamical dark-matter framework, and\ndemonstrate that dynamical dark matter is indeed a viable alternative to the\ntraditional paradigm of dark-matter physics. Dynamical dark matter must\ntherefore be considered alongside other approaches to the dark-matter problem,\nparticularly in scenarios involving large extra dimensions or string theory in\nwhich there exist large numbers of particles which are neutral under\nStandard-Model symmetries.\n","Comment: 45 pages, LaTeX, 10 figures.

To realize this\nidea in galaxies we use a particular DM cored profile that contains three\nparameters: a scale length (rs) and density (rho_0) of the halo, and a core\nradius (rc) stemming from the relativistic nature of the BDM model. We test\nthis model by fitting rotation curves of seventeen Low Surface Brightness\ngalaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS).

Since the phase is well controlled on\nlattices with larger time extents, we try the phase reweighting method in a\nregion beyond $\\mu/T=1$ where the Taylor expansion method cannot be applied.\nWorking in four-flavor QCD, we find a first-order like behavior on a $6^3\\times\n4$ lattice at $\\mu /T\\approx 0.8$ which was previously observed by Kentucky\ngroup with the canonical method. We also show that the winding number expansion\nhas a nice convergence property beyond $\\mu/T=1$.

Further, purely\nalgebraic conditions have been derived which the corresponding Lagrangians have\nto obey in order that the field theories be twins of each other. A further\ndiagnostical tool which, in general, allows to distinguish the topological\ndefects of a given theory from the corresponding defects of its twins is the\nspectrum of linear fluctuations about these defects. Very recently, however,\nexplicit examples of twin theories have been constructed such that not only\ntheir shapes and energy densities coincide, but also their linear fluctuation\nspectra are the same. Here we show that, again, there exist purely algebraic\nconditions for the Lagrangian densities which imply that the corresponding\nfield theories are twins and that the fluctuation spectra about their defects\ncoincide. These algebraic conditions allow to construct an infinite number of\ntwins with coinciding fluctuation spectra for a given theory, and we provide\nsome explicit examples. The importance of this result is related to the fact\nthat coinciding defects with coinciding energy densities and identical\nfluctuation spectra are almost indistinguishable physically, that is,\nindistinguishable in a linear or semiclassical approximation.

However, in practice the so-called jet\ntomography has turned out to be more difficult than expected initially. One of\nthe major obstacles in extracting reliable tomographic information from the\ndata is that neither the parton-medium interaction nor the medium geometry are\nknown with great precision, and thus a difference in model assumptions in the\nhard perturbative Quantum Choromdynamics (pQCD) modelling can usually be\ncompensated by a corresponding change of assumptions in the soft bulk medium\nsector and vice versa. The only way to overcome this problem is to study the\nfull systematics of combinations of parton-medium interaction and bulk medium\nevolution models. This work presents a meta-analysis summarizing results from a\nnumber of such systematical studies and discusses in detail how certain data\nsets provide specific constraints for models. Combining all available\ninformation, only a small group of models exhibiting certain characteristic\nfeatures consistent with a pQCD picture of parton-medium interaction is found\nto be viable given the data.

Results: We\ndemonstrate the DET-PET modification of the $np$ scattering wave functions and\nstudy the DET-PET manifestation in the binding energies of $^3$H and $^4$He\nnuclei and their correlation (Tjon line). Conclusions: It is shown that some\nDET-PETs generate modifications of the central component while the others\nmodify the tensor component of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs are able to\nmodify significantly the $np$ scattering wave functions and hence the off-shell\nproperties of the $NN$ interaction. DET-PETs give rise to significant changes\nin the binding energies of $^3$H (in the range of approximately 1.5 MeV) and\n$^4$He (in the range of more than 9 MeV) and are able to modify the correlation\npatterns of binding energies of these nuclei.\n"]}]

The\nso called local bias model, where galaxy density is a function of local matter\ndensity, is frequently discussed as a means to infer the matter power spectrum\nor correlation function from the measured galaxy correlation. However,\ngravitational evolution generates a term quadratic in the tidal tensor and thus\nnon-local in the density field, even if this term is absent in the initial\nconditions (Lagrangian space).

In an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory which admits a semi-classical\nlimit, we show that the complex fugacity generates interference between\nEuclidean path histories, i.e., monopole-instanton events, and radically alters\nthe vacuum structure.

At theta=pi, the monopole induced\nmass gap vanishes, despite the fact that monopole density is independent of\ntheta, due to destructive topological interference. The theory has two options:\nto remain gapless or to be gapped with a two-fold degenerate vacua.

We find a qualitatively\ndifferent behavior for d=3,4 w.r.t. d=2. In particular, considering any\n(sufficiently regular) gluon propagator D(p^2) and the one-loop-corrected ghost\npropagator G(p^2), we prove in the 2d case that sigma(p^2) blows up in the\ninfrared limit p -> 0 as -D(0)\\ln(p^2). Thus, for d=2, the no-pole condition\n\\sigma(p^2) < 1 (for p^2 > 0) can be satisfied only if D(0) = 0. On the\ncontrary, in d=3 and 4, sigma(p^2) is finite also if D(0) > 0. The same results\nare obtained by evaluating G(p^2) explicitly at one loop, using fitting forms\nfor D(p^2) that describe well the numerical data of D(p^2) in d=2,3,4 in the\nSU(2) case. These evaluations also show that, if one considers the coupling\nconstant g^2 as a free parameter, G(p^2) admits a one-parameter family of\nbehaviors (labelled by g^2), in agreement with Boucaud et al. In this case the\ncondition sigma(0) <= 1 implies g^2 <= g^2_c, where g^2_c is a 'critical'\nvalue. Moreover, a free-like G(p^2) in the infrared limit is obtained for any\nvalue of g^2 < g^2_c, while for g^2 = g^2_c one finds an infrared-enhanced\nG(p^2). Finally, we analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for sigma(p^2)\nand show that, for infrared-finite ghost-gluon vertices, one can bound\nsigma(p^2). Using these bounds we find again that only in the d=2 case does one\nneed to impose D(0) = 0 in order to satisfy the no-pole condition. The d=2\nresult is also supported by an analysis of the DSE using a spectral\nrepresentation for G(p^2). Thus, if the no-pole condition is imposed, solving\nthe d=2 DSE cannot lead to a massive behavior for D(p^2). These results apply\nto any Gribov copy inside the so-called first Gribov horizon, i.e. the 2d\nresult D(0) = 0 is not affected by Gribov noise.

The simplest example of such a CS-brane coupling is a domain\nwall coupled to the electromagnetic CS three-form. This describes a\ntopologically charged interface where the CS form AdA is supported, separating\ntwo three-dimensional spatial regions in 3+1 spacetime. Electrodynamics at\neither side of the brane is described by the same Maxwell's equations, but\nthose two regions have different vacua, characterized by a different value of\nthe \\theta-parameter multiplying the Pontryagin form F ^ F. The \\theta-term is\nthe abelian version of the concept introduced by 't Hooft for the resolution of\nthe U(1) problem in QCD. We point out that CS-generalized classical\nelectrodynamics shows new phenomena when two neighboring regions with different\n\\theta-vacua are present. These topological effects result from surface effects\ninduced by the boundary and we explore the consequences of such boundary\neffects for the propagation of the electromagnetic field in Maxwell theory.\nSeveral features, including optical and electrostatic/magnetostatic responses,\nwhich may be observable in condensed matter systems, like topological\ninsulators, are discussed.\n","Comment: 11 pages, no figures"]}]

In particular, we examine the\nextent to which these ensembles capture topological and confinement properties\nof the Yang-Mills vacuum. This further allows us to test the classic picture of\nmeron-induced quark confinement as triggered by dimeron dissociation. At small\nbare couplings, spacial, topological-charge and color correlations among the\ndimerons generate a short-range order which screens topological charges. With\nincreasing coupling this order weakens rapidly, however, in part because the\ndimerons gradually dissociate into their meron constituents. Monitoring\nconfinement properties by evaluating Wilson-loop expectation values, we find\nthe growing disorder due to these progressively liberated merons to generate a\nfinite and (with the coupling) increasing string tension. The short-distance\nbehavior of the static quark-antiquark potential, on the other hand, is\ndominated by small, \"instanton-like\" dimerons. String tension, action density\nand topological susceptibility of the dimeron ensembles in the physical\ncoupling region turn out to be of the order of standard values. Hence the above\nresults demonstrate without reliance on weak-coupling or low-density\napproximations that the dissociating dimeron component in the Yang-Mills vacuum\ncan indeed produce a meron-populated confining phase. The density of\ncoexisting, hardly dissociated and thus instanton-like dimerons seems to remain\nlarge enough, on the other hand, to reproduce much of the additional\nphenomenology successfully accounted for by non-confining instanton vacuum\nmodels. Hence dimeron ensembles should provide an efficient basis for a rather\ncomplete description of the Yang-Mills vacuum.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 17 figures"]}]

We show that the topological $p_{x}+ip_{y}$ superfluid\nphase can be realized in a single-component dipolar Fermi gas trapped in a 2D\nsquare optical lattice with this attractive interaction at low temperatures.\nThe $p_{x}+ip_{y}$ superfluid state has potential applications for topological\nquantum computing. We obtain the phase diagram of this system at zero\ntemperature. In the weak-coupling limit, the p-wave superfluid phase is stable\nfor all filling factors. As the interaction strength increases, it is stable\nclose to filling factors $n=0$ or $n=1$, and phase separation takes place in\nbetween. When the interaction strength is above a threshold, the system is\nphase separated for any $0<n<1$.

For flat potentials, a negative value of the\nhysteresis loop leads to the increase in amplitude of consecutive cycles and to\na universe with older and larger successive cycles.

This property makes it possible to derive a general\nexpression for the probability for the time of transition, valid for any\nquantum system, with the only requirement that the time of transition is\ncorrelated with a definite macroscopic record.\n  The framework developed here allows for the consideration of any experimental\nconfiguration for the measurement of the time of arrival and it also applies to\nrelativistic systems with interactions described by quantum field theory. We\nuse the method in order to describe time-of-arrival measurements in high-energy\nparticle reactions and for a rigorous derivation of the time-integrated\nprobabilities in particle oscillations.\n","Comment: 27 pages, latex.

The gauge theory we consider is\nquantum chromodynamics with the addition of a meson-like scalar degree of\nfreedom as well as an adjoint Weyl fermion.\n  At the two-loop level, and in the Veneziano limit, we firmly establish the\nexistence of several fixed points of which one is all directions stable in the\ninfrared. An interesting feature of the model is that this fixed point is lost,\nwithin the perturbatively trustable regime, by merging with another fixed point\nwhen varying the number of quark flavors. We show the emergence of the Miransky\nscaling and determine its properties. We are also able to determine the walking\nregion of the theory which turns out to be, at large number of colors, about\n12% of the conformal window. Furthermore, we determine highly relevant\nquantities for near conformal dynamics such as the anomalous dimension of the\nfermion masses.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 8 figures"]}]

These neutrinos can also be produced by oscillations of the active\nneutrinos in the early universe, leaving possible traces on different\ncosmological observables. Here we perform an updated study of the neutrino\nkinetic equations in (3+1) and (2+1) oscillation schemes, dynamically evolving\nprimordial asymmetries of active neutrinos and taking into account for the\nfirst time CP-violation effects. In the absence of neutrino asymmetries,\neV-mass scale sterile neutrinos would be completely thermalized creating a\ntension with respect to the CMB, LSS and BBN data. In the past literature,\nactive neutrino asymmetries have been invoked as a way to inhibit the sterile\nneutrino production via the in-medium suppression of the sterile-active mixing\nangle. However, neutrino asymmetries also permit a resonant sterile neutrino\nproduction. We find that if the active species have equal asymmetries L, a\nvalue |L|=10^{-3} is required to start suppressing the resonant sterile\nproduction, roughly an order of magnitude larger than what previously expected.\nWhen active species have opposite asymmetries the sterile abundance is further\nenhanced, requiring an even larger |L|\\simeq 10^{-2} to start suppressing their\nproduction. In the latter case, CP-violation (naturally expected) further\nexacerbates the phenomenon. Some consequences for cosmological observables are\nbriefly discussed: for example, it is likely that moderate suppressions of the\nsterile species production are associated with significant spectral distortions\nof the active neutrino species, with potentially interesting phenomenological\nconsequences especially for BBN.\n","Comment: (v2: 22 pages, 10 eps figures.

IFD constructs an\nensemble of non-parametric sub-grid field configurations from the combination\nof the data in computer memory, representing constraints on possible field\nconfigurations, and prior assumptions on the sub-grid field statistics. Each of\nthese field configurations can formally be evolved to a later moment since any\ndifferential operator of the dynamics can act on fields living in continuous\nspace. However, these virtually evolved fields need again a representation by\ndata in computer memory. The maximum entropy principle of information theory\nguides the construction of updated datasets via entropic matching, optimally\nrepresenting these field configurations at the later time. The field dynamics\nthereby become represented by a finite set of evolution equations for the data\nthat can be solved numerically. The sub-grid dynamics is treated within an\nauxiliary analytic consideration and the resulting scheme acts solely on the\ndata space. It should provide a more accurate description of the physical field\ndynamics than simulation schemes constructed ad-hoc, due to the more rigorous\naccounting of sub-grid physics and the space discretization process.\nAssimilation of measurement data into an IFD simulation is conceptually\nstraightforward since measurement and simulation data can just be merged.

Although both divergences may be\ninterpreted as terms in the Wald entropy, we point out that the contact term\nfor gauge fields comes from a gauge-dependent ambiguity in Wald's formula.\nRevisiting Kabat's derivation of the contact term, we show that it is sensitive\nto the treatment of infrared modes. To explore these infrared issues, we\nconsider two-dimensional compact manifolds, such as Euclidean de Sitter space,\nand show that the contact term arises from an incorrect treatment of zero\nmodes. In a manifestly gauge-invariant reduced phase space quantization, the\ngauge field contribution to the entropy is positive, finite, and equal to the\nentanglement entropy.\n","Comment: 27 pages"]}]

A current\nconsensus is that the stronger the SOC, the smaller is the critical interaction\nUc required for a spin-orbit Mott insulator, because the atomic SOC splits a\nband into different total angular momentum bands narrowing the effective\nbandwidth. It was further claimed that at large enough SOC, the stronger the\nSOC, the weaker the Uc because in general the effective SOC is enhanced with\nincreasing electron-electron interaction strength. Contrary to this\nexpectation, we find that, in orthorhombic perovskite oxides (Pbnm), the\nstronger the SOC, the bigger the Uc. This is originated from a line of Dirac\nnode in Jeff=1/2 bands near the Fermi level inherited from a combination of the\nlattice structure and a large SOC. Due to this protected line of nodes, there\nare small hole and electron pockets in SrIrO3, and such a small density of\nstates makes Hubbard interaction less efficient in building a magnetic\ninsulator. The full phase diagram in U vs. SOC is obtained, where non-magnetic\nsemimetal, magnetic metal, and magnetic insulator are found. Magnetic ordering\npatterns beyond Uc are also presented.

We study the possibility of\nlifting the mass of the SM-like Higgs boson by non-decoupling D-term from an\nadditional U(1) gauge symmetry.

In this paper we show that $EB$ correlations-based\nestimator is the best for upcoming polarization experiments. The $EB$ based\nestimator surpasses other estimators because it has the smallest noise and of\nall the estimators is least affected by systematics. Current polarimeters are\noptimized for the detection of $B$-mode polarization from either primordial\ngravitational waves or by large scale structure via gravitational lensing. In\nthe paper we also study optimization of CMB experiments for the detection of\ncosmological birefringence, in the presence of instrumental systematics, which\nby themselves are capable of producing $EB$ correlations; potentially mimicking\nCB.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables"]}]

We investigate whether direct detection experiments with\ndirectional sensitivity have the potential to observe this anisotropic\nscattering rate with the elastically scattering light WIMPs proposed to explain\nthe observed excesses. We find that the number of recoils required to detect an\nanisotropic signal from light WIMPs at 5 sigma significance varies from 7 to\nmore than 190 over the set of target nuclei and energy thresholds expected for\ndirectional detectors. Smaller numbers arise from configurations where the\ndetector is only sensitive to recoils from the highest speed, and hence most\nanisotropic, WIMPs. However, the event rate above threshold is very small in\nthese cases, leading to the need for large experimental exposures to accumulate\neven a small number of events. To account for this sensitivity to the tail of\nthe WIMP velocity distribution, whose shape is not well known, we consider two\nexemplar halo models spanning the range of possibilities. We also note that for\nan accurate calculation the Earth's orbital speed must be averaged over. We\nfind that the exposures required to detect 10 GeV WIMPs at a WIMP-proton\ncross-section of 10^-4 pb are of order 10^3 kg day for a 20 keV energy\nthreshold, within reach of planned directional detectors. Lower WIMP masses\nrequire higher exposures and/or lower energy thresholds for detection.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, v2: version to appear in Phys. Rev. D with\n  additional discussion"]}]

This observation threatens the viability of electroweak\nbaryogenesis, which favors, for example, a lighter Higgs and a Higgs coupled to\nor mixed with light scalars. To assess the broad impact of these constraints,\nwe propose a scheme for classifying models of the electroweak phase transition\nand impose constraints on a class-by-class basis. We find that models, such as\nthe MSSM, which rely on thermal loop effects are severely constrained by the\nmeasurement of a 125 GeV Higgs. Models which rely on tree-level effects from a\nlight singlet are also restricted by invisible decay and mixing constraints.\nMoreover, we find that the parametric region favored by electroweak\nbaryogenesis often coincides with an enhanced symmetry point with a distinctive\nphenomenological character. In particular, enhancements arising through an\napproximate continuous symmetry are phenomenologically disfavored, in contrast\nwith enhancements from discrete symmetries.

For the p-wave contribution we make our study below the mass ratio\nof 8.17, where a fermion-dimer bound state appears. We find that a strong\np-wave resonance is present at low energy, due to a virtual bound state, in the\nfermion-dimer system, which is a forerunner of the real bound state. This\nresonance becomes prominent in the mass ratio range around the one\ncorresponding to the $^{40}$K - $^6$Li mixtures, much studied experimentally.\nThis resonance should affect a number of physical properties. These include the\nequation of state of unbalanced mixtures at very low temperature but also the\nequation of state of balanced mixtures at moderate or high temperature. The\nfrequency and the damping of collective modes should also provide a convenient\nway to evidence this resonance. Finally it should be possible to modify the\neffective mass of one of the fermionic species by making use of an optical\nlattice. This would allow to study the strong dependence of the resonance as a\nfunction of the mass ratio of the two fermionic elements. In particular one\ncould check if the virtual bound state is relevant for the instabilities of\nthese mixtures.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures, takes over the content of arXiv:1206.1569"]}]

We resum\nthe large Sudakov logarithms $\\alpha_s^n \\log^{2n-m}(p_T^{J}/p_T^{veto})$ up to\nthe next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy, and present numerical results for\nHiggs boson production in association with a jet at the LHC.

On the other\nhand, providing incentives for microtask crowdsourcing is challenging since\nverifying the quality of submitted solutions is so expensive that will negate\nthe advantage of microtask crowdsourcing. We study cost-effective incentive\nmechanisms for microtask crowdsourcing in this paper. In particular, we\nconsider a model with strategic workers, where the primary objective of a\nworker is to maximize his own utility. Based on this model, we analyze two\nbasic mechanisms widely adopted in existing microtask crowdsourcing\napplications and show that, to obtain high quality solutions from workers,\ntheir costs are constrained by some lower bounds. We then propose a\ncost-effective mechanism that employs quality-aware worker training as a tool\nto stimulate workers to provide high quality solutions. We prove theoretically\nthat the proposed mechanism, when properly designed, can obtain high quality\nsolutions with an arbitrarily low cost. Beyond its theoretical guarantees, we\nfurther demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms through a set\nof behavioral experiments.\n"]}]

MTDs pose new challenges\nto the cellular network, one if which is that the low transmission power can\nlead to outage problems for the cell-edge devices. Another issue imminent to\nMTC is the \\emph{massive access} that can lead to overload of the radio\ninterface. In this paper we explore the opportunity opened by D2D links for\nsupporting MTDs, since it can be desirable to carry the MTC traffic not through\ndirect links to a Base Station, but through a nearby relay. MTC is modeled as a\nfixed-rate traffic with an outage requirement. We propose two network-assisted\nD2D schemes that enable the cooperation between MTDs and standard cellular\ndevices, thereby meeting the MTC outage requirements while maximizing the rate\nof the broadband services for the other devices.
