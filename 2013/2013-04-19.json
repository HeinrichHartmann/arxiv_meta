Historically, galaxy formation models\nhave had difficulty explaining the observed number counts of SMGs. We combine a\nsemi-empirical model with 3-D hydrodynamical simulations and 3-D dust radiative\ntransfer to predict the number counts of unlensed SMGs. Because the stellar\nmass functions, gas and dust masses, and sizes of our galaxies are constrained\nto match observations, we can isolate uncertainties related to the dynamical\nevolution of galaxy mergers and the dust radiative transfer. The number counts\nand redshift distributions predicted by our model agree well with observations.\nIsolated disc galaxies dominate the faint (S_1.1 < ~1 mJy, or S_850 < ~2 mJy)\npopulation. The brighter sources are a mix of merger-induced starbursts and\ngalaxy-pair SMGs; the latter subpopulation accounts for ~30 - 50 per cent of\nall SMGs at all S_1.1 > ~0.5 mJy (S_850 > ~1 mJy). The mean redshifts are ~3.0\n- 3.5, depending on the flux cut, and the brightest sources tend to be at\nhigher redshifts. Because the galaxy-pair SMGs will be resolved into multiple\nfainter sources by ALMA, the bright ALMA counts should be as much as 2 times\nless than those observed using single-dish telescopes. The agreement between\nour model, which uses a Kroupa IMF, and observations suggests that the IMF in\nhigh-redshifts starbursts need not be top-heavy; if the IMF were top-heavy, our\nmodel would over-predict the number counts. We conclude that the difficulty\nsome models have reproducing the observed SMG counts is likely indicative of\nmore general problems -- such as an under-prediction of the abundance of\nmassive galaxies or a star formation rate--stellar mass relation normalisation\nlower than that observed -- rather than a problem specific to the SMG\npopulation.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS.

The light curve is of unprecedented quality, revealing a\ndeep, symmetric primary eclipse as well as a clear reflection effect and\nsecondary eclipse. In addition, there are other small disturbances, some of\nwhich repeat at the same phase over the four cycles monitored. The shape of the\nprimary light curve has clearly evolved significantly over the past 40 yr.\nWhile its overall duration and depth have remained roughly constant, the slopes\nof the descent and ascent phases are significantly shallower now than in the\npast and its distinctive flat-bottomed \"pseudo-totality\" is much less obvious\nor even absent in the most recent data. We further demonstrate that the primary\neclipse was detected at X-ray wavelengths during the Chandra COUP study. The\nlight curve continues to be well modeled by a self-luminous and reflective\ndisk-shaped object seen nearly edge-on orbiting the primary. The dramatic\nchange in shape over four decades is modeled as an opacity variation in a\ntenuous outer envelope or disk of the secondary object. We presume that the\nsecondary is an extremely young protostar at an earlier evolutionary phase than\ncan be commonly observed elsewhere in the Galaxy and that the opacity\nvariations observed are related to its digestion of some accreted matter over\nthe last 50-100 yr.

We use the analysis of X-ray\nobservations in order to study the polar cap region of radio pulsars. The size\nof the hot spots implies that the magnetic field configuration just above the\nstellar surface differs significantly from a purely dipole one. We can estimate\nthe surface magnetic field as of the order of $10^{14}\\,{\\rm G}$. On the other\nhand, the temperature of the hot spots is about a few million Kelvins. Based on\nthese two facts the Partially Screened Gap (PSG) model was proposed to describe\nthe Inner Acceleration Region (IAR). The PSG model assumes that the temperature\nof the actual polar cap is equal to the so-called critical value, i.e. the\ntemperature at which the outflow of thermal ions from the surface screens the\ngap completely.\n  We have found that, depending on the conditions above the polar cap, the\ngeneration of high energetic photons in IAR can be caused either by Curvature\nRadiation (CR) or by Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS). This results in two\ndifferent scenarios of breaking the acceleration gap: the so-called PSG-off\nmode for CR-dominated gaps and the PSG-on mode ICS-dominated gaps. The\nexistence of two different mechanisms of gap breakdown naturally explains the\nmode-changing and the pulse nulling. Furthermore, the mode changes of the IAR\nmay explain the anti-correlation of radio and X-ray emission in very recent\nobservations of PSR B0943+10 (Hermsen et al., 2013).\n  Simultaneous analysis of X-ray and radio properties have allowed to develop a\nmodel which explains the drifting subpulse phenomenon. According to this model\nthe drift takes place when the charge density in IAR differs from the\nGoldreich-Julian co-rotational density. The proposed model allows to verify\nboth the radio drift parameters and X-ray efficiency of the observed pulsars.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 170 pages, 104 figures, 7 tables.

Toward the study of fixed\npoints (stable configurations on which no grain can move) obtained from $N$\nstacked grains, we propose an iterative study of KSPM evolution consisting in\nthe repeated addition of one grain on a heap of sand, triggering an avalanche\nat each iteration. We develop a formal background for the study of avalanches,\nresumed in a finite state word transducer, and explain how this transducer may\nbe used to predict the form of fixed points. Further precise developments\nprovide a plain formula for fixed points of KSPM(3), showing the emergence of a\nwavy shape.\n","Comment: 30 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1106.2670,\n  arXiv:1101.5940"]}]

Our aim was to study\nboth theoretically and experimentally its reaction-diffusion mechanism to find\nthe source of that selectivity. Methods ClO2 permeation measurements through\nprotein membranes were performed and the time delay of ClO2 transport due to\nreaction and diffusion was determined. To calculate ClO2 penetration depths and\nestimate bacterial killing times, approximate solutions of the\nreaction-diffusion equation were derived. Additionally, as a preliminary test,\nthree patients with infected wounds were treated with a 300 ppm high purity\nClO2 solution and the healing process was documented. Results The rate law of\nthe reaction-diffusion model predicts that the killing time is proportional to\nthe square of the characteristic size (e.g. diameter) of a body, thus, small\nones will be killed extremely fast. For example, the killing time for a\nbacterium is on the order of milliseconds in a 300 ppm ClO2 solution. Thus, the\nfew minutes of contact time (owing to the volatility of ClO2) is quite enough\nto kill all bacteria, but short enough to keep ClO2 penetration into the living\ntissues safely below 0.1 mm, minimizing cytotoxic effects.

The network as well\nas the embedded computers and sensors in the vehicle will be invisible to the\ndriver, who will get the required services during his journey. New type of ad\nhoc network is the Vehicular Ad hoc Network, in which vehicles constitute the\nmobile nodes in the network. Due to the prohibitive cost of deploying and\nimplementing such as system in a real world, most research work in VANET relies\non simulations for evaluation purpose. The key concept for VANET simulations is\na real world vehicular mobility model which will ensures conclusions drawn from\nsimulation experiments will carry through to real world deployments. In this\npaper we present a tool SUMO, MOVE that allows users to easily generate real\nworld mobility models for VANET simulations. MOVE tool is built on top of SUMO\nwhich is open source micro traffic simulator. Output of MOVE is a real world\nmobility model and can used by NS-2 and Qual-net simulator. In this paper we\nevaluate and compare ad hoc routing performance for vehicular nodes using MOVE,\nwhich is using random way point model.
