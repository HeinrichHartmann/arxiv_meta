The key for the dependence modelling is the covariance matrix of an\nunderlying latent multivariate Gaussian. Most approaches to MLE in multivariate\nprobit regression rely on MCEM algorithms to avoid computationally intensive\nevaluations of multivariate normal orthant probabilities. As an alternative to\nthe much used Gibbs sampler a new SMC sampler for truncated multivariate\nnormals is proposed. The algorithm proceeds in two stages where samples are\nfirst drawn from truncated multivariate Student $t$ distributions and then\nfurther evolved towards a Gaussian. The sampler is then embedded in a MCEM\nalgorithm. The sequential nature of SMC methods can be exploited to design a\nfully sequential version of the EM, where the samples are simply updated from\none iteration to the next rather than resampled from scratch. Recycling the\nsamples in this manner significantly reduces the computational cost. An\nalternative view of the standard conditional maximisation step provides the\nbasis for an iterative procedure to fully perform the maximisation needed in\nthe EM algorithm. The identifiability of MPM is also thoroughly discussed. In\nparticular, the likelihood invariance can be embedded in the EM algorithm to\nensure that constrained and unconstrained maximisation are equivalent. A simple\niterative procedure is then derived for either maximisation which takes\neffectively no computational time. The method is validated by applying it to\nthe widely analysed Six Cities dataset and on a higher dimensional simulated\nexample. Previous approaches to the Six Cities overly restrict the parameter\nspace but, by considering the correct invariance, the maximum likelihood is\nquite naturally improved when treating the full unrestricted model.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 2 figures.

By analyzing within-patient longitudinal\nsequence data, we make four observations that shed a light on the underlying\nprocesses and allow us infer the short-term effective population size of the\nviral population in a patient. Our first observation is that the evolution of\ndrug resistance usually occurs by the fixation of one drug-resistance mutation\nat a time, as opposed to several changes simultaneously. Second, we find that\nthese fixation events are accompanied by a reduction in genetic diversity in\nthe region surrounding the fixed drug-resistance mutation, due to the\nhitchhiking effect. Third, we observe that the fixation of drug-resistance\nmutations involves both hard and soft selective sweeps. In a hard sweep, a\nresistance mutation arises in a single viral particle and drives all linked\nmutations with it when it spreads in the viral population, which dramatically\nreduces genetic diversity. On the other hand, in a soft sweep, a resistance\nmutation occurs multiple times on different genetic backgrounds, and the\nreduction of diversity is weak. Using the frequency of occurrence of hard and\nsoft sweeps we estimate the effective population size of HIV to be 1.5 * 10^5\n(95% confidence interval 0.8 * 10^5, 4.8 * 10^5). This number is much lower\nthan the actual number of infected cells, but much larger than previous\npopulation size estimates based on synonymous diversity.

In this paper we shed more light on the\nphysical origin of the tail by regularizing the term which is usually ignored\nin the literature since it vanishes due to the action of the delta function.\nWith this extra term the Green's function does not satisfy the source-free wave\nequation (in the region outside of the source). We show that this term\ncorresponds to a charge imprinted on the light cone shell. Unlike the vector\nfield charge, a moving scalar field charge is not Lorentz invariant and is\ncontracted by the relativistic $\\sqrt{1-v^2}$ factor. If a scalar charge is\nmoving at the speed of light, it appears to be zero in the static (with respect\nto the original physical charge) observer's frame.

In this paper, we aim to track the GCE by using the 29Si/30Si ratios in\nevolved stars and tentatively relate this to presolar grain composition. We\nused the APEX telescope to detect thermal SiO isotopologue emission toward four\noxygen-rich M-type stars. Together with the data retrieved from the Herschel\nscience archive and from the literature, we were able to obtain the 29Si/30Si\nratios for a total of 15 evolved stars inferred from their optically thin 29SiO\nand 30SiO emission. These stars cover a range of masses and ages, and because\nthey do not significantly alter 29Si/30Si during their lifetimes, they provide\nexcellent probes of the ISM metallicity (or 29Si/30Si ratio) as a function of\ntime. The 29Si/30Si ratios inferred from the thermal SiO emission tend to be\nlower toward low-mass oxygen-rich stars (e.g., down to about unity for W Hya),\nand close to an interstellar or solar value of 1.5 for the higher-mass carbon\nstar IRC+10216 and two red supergiants. There is a tentative correlation\nbetween the 29Si/30Si ratios and the mass-loss rates of evolved stars, where we\ntake the mass-loss rate as a proxy for the initial stellar mass or current\nstellar age. This is consistent with the different abundance ratios found in\npresolar grains. We found that older objects (up to possibly 10 Gyr old) in our\nsample trace a previous, lower 29Si/30Si value of about 1. Material with this\nisotopic ratio is present in two subclasses of presolar grains, providing\nindependent evidence of the lower ratio. Therefore, the 29Si/30Si ratio derived\nfrom the SiO emission of evolved stars is a useful diagnostic tool for the\nstudy of the GCE and presolar grains.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Similarly all\nneighbors broadcasted PFR is received and processed by the node to define the\n'G' and 'BP' values. The G value is used to isolate selfish nodes from the\nrouting paths and BP denotes the amount of packets to be dropped by an honest\nnode against a selfish node in spite of its misbehavior/packet drops.\nCooperation within the neighbors, certainly result in subsiding misbehavior of\nselfish nodes, therein enhancing cooperation of the whole MANET. This model\nensures honesty and reliability in MANET because it does not eliminate a node,\nbut it behaves in the same way as the node behaved. Therefore, it justifies its\nname, after all mirrors reflects the same.

The answer may follow from the observation that in quantum theory,\nunlike in other theories, whenever there is an experiment to measure $A$\nsimultaneously with $B$, another to measure $B$ with $C$, and another to\nmeasure $A$ with $C$, there is always an experiment to measure all of them\nsimultaneously. This property implies that quantum theory satisfies a seemingly\nirrelevant restriction called the exclusivity (E) principle which,\nsurprisingly, explains the set of quantum correlations in some fundamental\nscenarios. An open problem is whether the E principle explains the maximum\nquantum violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. Here we show experimentally that\nthe E principle imposes an upper bound to the violation of the Bell-CHSH\ninequality that matches the maximum predicted by quantum theory. For that, we\nuse the result of an independent experiment testing a specific\nnon-contextuality inequality. We perform both experiments: the Bell-CHSH\ninequality experiment on polarization entangled states of pairs of photons in\nStockholm and, to demonstrate independence, the non-contextuality inequality\nexperiment on single photons' orbital angular momentum states in Rome. The\nobserved results provide the first experimental evidence that the E principle\ndetermines the limits of quantum correlations and prove that hypothetical\nsuper-quantum violations for either experiment would violate the E principle.\nThis supports the conclusion that the E principle captures a fundamental\nlimitation of nature.

The data are obtained from thorough analyses of the\nresults of magnetization, magnetoresistance and spin-dependent Hall effect\nmeasurements. The experimental findings compare favorably, without adjustable\nparameters, with the prediction of the Rudermann-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY)\nmodel or its continuous-medium limit, that is, the Zener model, provided that\nthe presence of the competing antiferromagnetic spin-spin superexchange\ninteraction is taken into account, and the complex structure of the valence\nband is properly incorporated into the calculation of the spin susceptibility\nof the hole liquid. In general terms, the findings demonstrate how the\ninterplay between the ferromagnetic RKKY interaction, carrier localization, and\nintrinsic antiferromagnetic superexchange affects the ordering temperature and\nthe saturation value of magnetization in magnetically and electrostatically\ndisordered systems.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures"]}]
