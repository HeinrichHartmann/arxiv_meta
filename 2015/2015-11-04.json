Practical ADCs not only sample but\nalso quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is\nan inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth.\nIn this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the\nemphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In\nparticular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture\njust their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal\nreconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on\nthe best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d.\nrandom Gaussian matrices describe measurement mappings achieving, with\noverwhelming probability, nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider\nreconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the\nBinary $\\epsilon$-Stable Embedding (B$\\epsilon$SE) property, which\ncharacterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the\nsame class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also\nenable such a robust mapping.

In a recent work \\citep{ref:rc} this rumor source detection problem\nwas introduced and studied. The authors proposed the graph score function {\\em\nrumor centrality} as an estimator for detecting the source. They establish it\nto be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible\nInfected (SI) model with exponential spreading times for regular trees. They\nshowed that as the size of the infected graph increases, for a path graph\n(2-regular tree), the probability of source detection goes to $0$ while for\n$d$-regular trees with $d \\geq 3$ the probability of detection, say $\\alpha_d$,\nremains bounded away from $0$ and is less than $1/2$. However, their results\nstop short of providing insights for the performance of the rumor centrality\nestimator in more general settings such as irregular trees or the SI model with\nnon-exponential spreading times.\n  This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of\nrumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model\nwith a generic spreading time distribution. The key result is an interesting\nconnection between a continuous time branching process and the effectiveness of\nrumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection\nprobability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all previous results as a\nspecial case and obtain a variety of novel results including the {\\em\nuniversality} of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI\nmodel with a generic spreading time distribution.\n","Comment: 38 pages, 6 figures"]}]

In particular, the self force of a\npoint charge in the geometry is characterized analitically. The differences\nbetween the self force in both cases is a theoretical experiment for\ndistinguishing both geometries, which otherwise are locally indistinguishable.\nThis idea was applied before to four and higher dimensional black holes by the\npresent and other authors. However, the particularities of the BTZ geometry\nmakes the analysis considerable more complicated than usual electrostatic in a\nflat geometry, and its even harder than its four dimensional counterparts.\nFirst, the BTZ space times are not asymptotically flat but instead\nasymptotically AdS. In addition, the relative distance $d(r,r+1)$ between two\nparticles located at a radius $r$ and $r+1$ in the geometry tends to zero when\n$r\\to\\infty$. This behavior, which is radically different in a flat geometry,\nchanges the analysis of the asymptotic conditions for the electrostatic field.\nIn addition, there are no summation formulas that allow a closed analytic\nexpression for the self force. We find a method to calculate such force in\nseries, and the resulting expansion is convergent to the real solution.\nHowever, we suspect that the convergence is not uniform. In other, for points\nthat are far away from the black hole the calculation of the force requires\nhigher order summation. These subtleties are carefully analyzed in the paper,\nand it is shown that they lead to severe problems when calculating the self\nforce for asymptotic points in the geometry.\n","Comment: Contains some more elaborated interpretation of the results and\n  larger explanations"]}]

Here, we apply this\ntechnique to study the interaction between the free atoms and the vacuum in a\ncavity. Due to the gradient field in the vacuum cavity, the external orbital\nmotions and the internal electronic states of atoms can be weakly coupled via\nthe atom-field electric-dipole interaction.

In the quantum field\ntheoretic approach the Schwinger's mechanism is generally used to give an\nexplanation of this tunneling process. It is the decay of quantum vacuum into\nparticle anti-particle pairs near the black hole surface. However, in a\nreference frame undergoing an uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat\nMinkowski space-time geometry, in the non-relativistic approximation, the\nparticle production near the event horizon of a black hole may be treated as a\nkind of Fowler-Nordheim field emission, which is the typical electron emission\nprocess from a metal surface under the action of an external electrostatic\nfield. This type of emission from metal surface is allowed even at extremely\nlow temperature. It has been noticed that in one-dimensional scenario, the\nSchr$\\ddot{\\rm{o}}$dinger equation satisfied by the created particle\n(anti-particle) near the event horizon, can be reduced to a differential form\nwhich is exactly identical with that obeyed by an electron immediately after\nthe emission from the metal surface under the action of a strong electrostatic\nfield. The mechanism of particle production near the event horizon of a black\nhole is therefore identified with Schwinger process in relativistic quantum\nfield theory, whereas in the non-relativistic scenario it may be interpreted as\nFowler-Nordheim emission process, when observed from an uniformly accelerated\nframe.\n","Comment: Title has been changed, the result is re-analyzed, the conclusion\n  part is changed accordimgly. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1412.2215 To appear in Astrophysics and Space Science"]}]

Focusing the study to the\nlarge and small cosmic time $t$ limits, we were able to find which $F(R)$\ngravities can generate the matter bounce Hubble parameter. In the case of small\ncosmic time limit, which corresponds to large curvature values, the $F(R)$\ngravity is $F(R)\\sim R+\\alpha R^2$, which is an inflation generating gravity,\nand at small curvature, or equivalently, large cosmic time, the $F(R)$ gravity\ngenerating the corresponding limit of the matter bounce Hubble parameter, is\n$F(R)\\sim \\frac{1}{R}$, a gravity known to produce late-time acceleration. Thus\nwe have the physically appealing picture in which a Jordan frame $F(R)$ gravity\nthat imitates the matter bounce solution at large and small curvatures, can\ngenerate Starobinsky inflation and late-time acceleration. Moreover, the scale\nfactor corresponding to the reconstruction technique coincides almost\ncompletely to the matter bounce scenario scale factor, when considered in the\naforementioned limiting curvature cases.

We calculate the probability that a\ncomplex made up of a given number of molecules is completely formed, as well as\nthe distribution of completion times, upon the binding of a seed molecule at a\ntarget site on the filament (without explicitly modeling the three-dimensional\ndiffusion that precedes binding). We compare two different mechanisms of\nassembly where molecules bind in sequential and random order. Our results\nindicate that while the probability of completion is greater for random\nbinding, the completion time scales exponentially with the size of the complex;\nin contrast, it scales as a power-law or slower for sequential binding,\nasymptotically. Furthermore, we provide model predictions for the dissociation\nand residence times of the seed molecule, which are observables accessible in\nsingle molecule tracking experiments.\n","Comment: to appear in Phys.

Our results show that the concentration and mass estimates in the\nmodified gravity models are, within the errorbars, the same as in $\\Lambda$CDM.\nThis result demonstrates that, for the Nonlocal model, the modifications to\ngravity are too weak at the cluster redshifts, and for the Galileon model, the\nscreening mechanism is very efficient inside the cluster radius. However, at\ndistances $\\sim \\left[2-20\\right] {\\rm Mpc}/h$ from the cluster center, we find\nthat the surrounding force profiles are enhanced by $\\sim20-40\\%$ in the Cubic\nGalileon model. This has an impact on dynamical mass estimates, which means\nthat tests of gravity based on comparisons between lensing and dynamical masses\ncan also be applied to the Cubic Galileon model.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables.

In addition, I obtain the contribution of\nthe spatial structure of the wave to this torque, unknown to this date, showing\nits effect in the orbiting of the object, and demonstrating that it often leads\nto a negative torque on a single particle, i.e. opposite to the incident\nhelicity, producing an orbital motion contrary to its spinning. Furthermore, I\nestablish a decomposition of the electromagnetic torque into conservative and\nnon-conservative components in which the helicity and its flow play a role\nanalogous to the energy and its flux for electromagnetic forces.

The last five years have witnessed an explosion in\nmagnetar research which has led, among other things, to the discovery of\ntransient, or \"outbursting,\" and \"low-field\" magnetars. Substantial progress\nhas been made also on the theoretical side. Quite detailed models for\nexplaining the magnetars' persistent X-ray emission, the properties of the\nbursts, the flux evolution in transient sources have been developed and\nconfronted with observations. New insight on neutron star asteroseismology has\nbeen gained through improved models of magnetar oscillations. The long-debated\nissue of magnetic field decay in neutron stars has been addressed, and its\nimportance recognized in relation to the evolution of magnetars and to the\nlinks among magnetars and other families of isolated neutron stars. The aim of\nthis paper is to present a comprehensive overview in which the observational\nresults are discussed in the light of the most up-to-date theoretical models\nand their implications. This addresses not only the particular case of magnetar\nsources, but the more fundamental issue of how physics in strong magnetic\nfields can be constrained by the observations of these unique sources.\n","Comment: 81 pages, 24 figures, This is an author-created, un-copyedited\n  version of an article submitted to Reports on Progress in Physics"]}]

The fractional contributions of stellar mass loss to the cosmic star\nformation rate (SFR) and stellar mass densities increase with time, reaching\n$35 \\%$ and $19 \\%$, respectively, at $z=0$. The importance of recycling\nincreases steeply with galaxy stellar mass for $M_{\\ast} < 10^{10.5}$\nM$_{\\odot}$, and decreases mildly at higher mass. This trend arises from the\nmass dependence of feedback associated with star formation and AGN, which\npreferentially suppresses star formation fuelled by recycling. Recycling is\nmore important for satellites than centrals and its contribution decreases with\ngalactocentric radius. The relative contribution of AGB stars increases with\ntime and towards galaxy centers. This is a consequence of the more gradual\nrelease of AGB ejecta compared to that of massive stars, and the preferential\nremoval of the latter by star formation-driven outflows and by lock up in\nstellar remnants. Recycling-fuelled star formation exhibits a tight, positive\ncorrelation with galaxy metallicity, with a secondary dependence on the\nrelative abundance of alpha elements (which are predominantly synthesized in\nmassive stars), that is insensitive to the subgrid models for feedback. Hence,\nour conclusions are directly relevant for the origin of the mass-metallicity\nrelation and metallicity gradients. Applying the relation between recycling and\nmetallicity to the observed mass-metallicity relation yields our best estimate\nof the mass-dependent contribution of recycling.

The combination of favourable\natmospheric parameters for detailed abundance studies and their known distances\nmake these objects ideal probes of the internal AGB third dredge-up and\ns-process nucleosynthesis in that they provide observational constraints for\ntheoretical AGB models.

We used Integral Field\nSpectra from the Wide Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3 m telescope to provide\nspectroscopy across the whole object covering the spectral range 3400-7000\n{\\AA}. We formed narrow-band images to investigate the excitation structure.\nThe spectral analysis shows that the object is a distant Peimbert Type I PN of\nlow excitation, formally of excitation class of 0.5. The low electron density,\nhigh dynamical age, and low surface brightness of the object confirm that it is\nobserved fairly late in its evolution. It shows clear evidence for dredge-up of\nCN-processed material characteristic of its class. In addition, the low\npeculiar velocity of 7 km s$^{-1}$ shows it to be a member of the young disk\ncomponent of our Galaxy. We built a self-consistent photoionisation model for\nthe PNe matching the observed spectrum, the H$\\beta$ luminosity, and the\ndiameter. On the basis of this we derive an effective temperature $\\log T_{\\rm\neff} \\sim 5.05$ and luminosity $1.85 < \\log L < 2.25$. The temperature is much\nhigher than might have been expected using the excitation class, proving that\nthis can be misleading in classifying evolved PNe. PN G342.0-01.7 is in\ninteraction with its surrounding interstellar medium through which the object\nis moving in the south-west direction.

We find new chains of\nself-gravitating |n| = 1 Skyrmions-anti-Skyrmions (S-A) which emerge at some\ncritical non-zero value of the gravitational coupling and do not have flat\nspace limit. In contrast, the branches of self-gravitating |n| $\\ge$ 2 S-A\nchains emerge from the corresponding flat space configurations. In both cases\nthese branches merge at some maximal value of the effective gravitational\ncoupling the branches of different type. The branch of gravitating S-A pair\nextends all the way back to the limit of vanishing coupling constant where\nsolutions approach the corresponding generalised Bartnik-McKinnon solutions.\nThe upper branch of gravitating S-A-S chain exist up to some critical value of\nthe gravitational coupling at which the chain becomes broken. We further find\nthat for small values of the coupling constant on the upper branches, the\nsolutions correspond to composite systems, consisting of a scaled inner\nEinstein-Yang-Mills solution and outer Skyrmions which are separating from the\ninner configuration.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

Extracting such information from microwave\nsurveys requires disentangling between foreground emissions and the\ncosmological signal, which boils down to solving a component separation\nproblem. Component separation techniques have been widely studied for the\nrecovery of CMB temperature anisotropies but quite rarely for the polarization\nmodes.

More\nrecent methods, which rather emphasize on the sparsity of the components in the\nwavelet domain, have been shown to provide low-foreground, full-sky estimate of\nthe CMB temperature anisotropies. Building on sparsity, the present paper\nintroduces a new component separation technique dubbed PolGMCA (Polarized\nGeneralized Morphological Component Analysis), which refines previous work to\nspecifically tackle the estimation of the polarized CMB maps: i) it benefits\nfrom a recently introduced sparsity-based mechanism to cope with partially\ncorrelated components, ii) it builds upon estimator aggregation techniques to\nfurther yield a better noise contamination/non-Gaussian foreground residual\ntrade-off. The PolGMCA algorithm is evaluated on simulations of full-sky\npolarized microwave sky simulations using the Planck Sky Model (PSM), which\nshow that the proposed method achieve a precise recovery of the CMB map in\npolarization with low noise/foreground contamination residuals.

The broadband\nfrequency coverage, together with the fast survey speed generated by LOFAR's\nmultibeaming capabilities, make MSSS the first survey of the sort anticipated\nto be carried out with the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Two of the\nsixteen frequency bands included in the survey were chosen to exactly overlap\nthe frequency coverage of large-area Very Large Array (VLA) and Giant Metrewave\nRadio Telescope (GMRT) surveys at 74 MHz and 151 MHz respectively. The survey\nperformance is illustrated within the \"MSSS Verification Field\" (MVF), a region\nof 100 square degrees centered at J2000 (RA,Dec)=(15h,69deg).

PSN\nJ07285387+3349106 exploded in the inner region of an infrared luminous galaxy,\nand is the most reddened SN Ibn discovered so far. We apply multiple methods to\nderive the total reddening to the SN, and determine a total colour excess\nE(B-V)(tot) = 0.99 +- 0.48 mag. Accounting for the reddening correction, which\nis affected by a large uncertainty, we estimate a peak absolute magnitude of\nM(V) = -20.30 +- 1.50. The spectra are dominated by continuum emission at early\nphases, and He I lines with narrow P-Cygni profiles are detected. We also\nidentify weak Fe III and N II features. All these lines show an absorption\ncomponent which is blue-shifted by about 900-1000 km/s. The spectra also show\nrelatively broad He I line wings with low contrast, which extend to above 3000\nkm/s. From about 2 weeks past maximum, broad lines of O I, Mg II and the Ca II\nnear-infrared triplet are identified. The composition and the expansion\nvelocity of the circumstellar material, and the presence of He I and\nalpha-elements in the SN ejecta indicate that PSN J07285387+3349106 was\nproduced by the core-collapse of a stripped-envelope star. We suggest that the\nprecursor was WNE-type Wolf-Rayet star in its dense, He-rich circumstellar\ncocoon.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Our goal is to characterize the integrated and resolved\nspectral properties of VLSS J1431+1331 and estimate source ages based on\nsynchrotron radio emission models, thus putting constraints on the AGN duty\ncycle. Using a broad spectral coverage, we have derived spectral and curvature\nmaps, and used synchrotron ageing models to determine the time elapsed from the\nlast time the source plasma was energized. We used LOFAR, Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope (GMRT) and Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) data. Based on our ageing\nanalysis, we infer that the AGN that created this source currently has very low\nlevels of activity or that it is switched off. The derived ages for the larger\nsource component range from around 60 to 130 Myr, hinting that the AGN activity\ndecreased or stopped around 60 Myr ago. Our analysis suggests that VLSS\nJ1431.8+1331 is an intriguing, two-component source. The larger component seems\nto host a faint radio core, suggesting that the source may be an AGN radio\nrelic. The spectral index we observe from the smaller component is distinctly\nflatter at lower frequencies than the spectral index of the larger component,\nsuggesting the possibility that the smaller component may be a shocked plasma\nbubble.

A minimum level of nuclear activity is thought to be necessary\n--- but not sufficient --- for planets to be habitable. Extending previous work\nthat focused on short-lived nuclei, this paper considers the delivery of\nlong-lived radioactive nuclei to circumstellar disks in star forming regions.\nAlthough the long-lived nuclear species are always present, their abundances\ncan be enhanced through multiple mechanisms. Most stars form in embedded\ncluster environments, so that disks can be enriched directly by intercepting\nejecta from supernovae within the birth clusters. In addition, molecular clouds\noften provide multiple episodes of star formation, so that nuclear abundances\ncan accumulate within the cloud; subsequent generations of stars can thus\nreceive elevated levels of radioactive nuclei through this distributed\nenrichment scenario. This paper calculates the distribution of additional\nenrichment for $^{40}$K, the most abundant of the long-lived radioactive\nnuclei. We find that distributed enrichment is more effective than direct\nenrichment. For the latter mechanism, ideal conditions lead to about 1 in 200\nsolar systems being directly enriched in $^{40}$K at the level inferred for the\nearly solar nebula (thereby doubling the abundance). For distributed enrichment\nfrom adjacent clusters, about 1 in 80 solar systems are enriched at the same\nlevel.

There was particular interest in determining the rationality of a\ngiven algebraic $k$ tori. As rationality problems for algebraic varieties are\nin general difficult, it is natural to consider relaxed notions such as stable\nrationality, or even retract rationality. Work of the above authors and later\nSaltman in the eighties determined necessary and sufficient conditions to\ndetermine when an algebraic torus is stably rational, respectively retract\nrational in terms of the integral representations of its associated character\nlattice. An interesting question is to ask whether a stably rational algebraic\n$k$ torus is always rational. In the general case, there exist examples of\nnon-rational stably rational $k$ varieties. Algebraic $k$ tori of dimension $r$\nare classified up to isomorphism by conjugacy classes of finite subgroups of\nGL$_r(\\mathbb{Z})$. This makes it natural to example the rationality problem\nfor algebraic $k$ tori of small dimensions. In 1967, Voskresenskii proved that\nall algebraic tori of dimension 2 are rational. In 1990, Kunyavskii determined\nwhich algebraic tori of dimension 3 were rational.

Once we determine the saturation power corresponding to\nthe maximum EE in advance, we can solve the EE maximization problem with SE\nmaximization schemes with low complexity. The derived saturation power is\nparameterized by employing random matrix theory, which relies only on the\nsecond order channel statistics.

We use a reinforcement learning\nframework within the full and partial observability of Markov decision\nprocesses and analyse the underlying behaviour of the manipulators by finding\nthe causes of what encourages the traders to perform fraudulent activities.\nThis reveals procedures to counter the problem that may be helpful to market\nregulators as our model predicts the activity of spoofers.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables"]}]

The situation can be improved by additionally applying some data\ncompression techniques: removing redundancy and optimally encoding the actual\ninformation. Preferably, both filtering and data compression should fit in FPGA\nalready used for data acquisition - reducing requirements of both data storage\nand networking architecture.\n  We will briefly explain and discuss some basic techniques, for a better focus\napplied to design a dedicated data compression system basing on a sample data\nfrom a prototype of a tracking detector: 10000 events for 48 channels. We will\nfocus on the time data here, which after neglecting the headers and applying\ndata filtering, requires on average 1170 bits/event using the current coding.\nEncoding relative times (differences) and grouping data by channels, reduces\nthis number to 798 bits/channel, still using fixed length coding: a fixed\nnumber of bits used for a given value. Using variable length Huffman coding to\nencode numbers of digital pulses for a channel and the most significant bits of\nvalues (simple binning) reduces further this number to 552 bits/event. Using\nadaptive binning: denser for frequent values, and an accurate entropy coder we\nget further down to 455 bits/event - this option can easily fit unused\nresources of FPGA currently used for data acquisition. Finally, using separate\nprobability distributions for different channels, what could be done by a\nsoftware compressor, leads to 437bits/event, what is 2.67 times less than the\noriginal 1170 bits/event.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures"]}]
