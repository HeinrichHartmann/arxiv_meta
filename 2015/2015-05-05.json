For a given initial state of the system, these\nbounds depend on the nature and state of the controller. We consider a general\nsituation where the controlled quantum system is coupled to both an external\nclassical field (referred to as a classical controller) and an auxiliary\nquantum system (referred to as a quantum controller). In this general\nsituation, the kinematic bound is between the classical kinematic bound (CKB),\ncorresponding to the case when only the classical controller is available, and\nthe quantum kinematic bound (QKB), corresponding to the ultimate physical limit\nof the objective's value. Specifically, when the control objective is the\nexpectation value of a quantum observable (a Hermitian operator on the system's\nHilbert space), the QKBs are the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of this\noperator. We present, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the necessary and\nsufficient conditions for surpassing the CKB and reaching the QKB, through the\nuse of a quantum controller. The general conditions are illustrated by examples\nin which the system and controller are initially in thermal states. The\nobtained results provide a basis for the design of quantum controllers capable\nof maximizing the control yield and reaching the ultimate physical limit.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The liquid helium 4 is strongly interacting and has no spin; there is\nalmost no way to change its parameters, such as interaction strength and\ndensity. The new superfluid, Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), offers various\naspects of advantages over liquid helium. On the one hand, BEC is weakly\ninteracting and has spin degrees of freedom.

Great efforts have been devoted to studying\nthese new aspects of superfluidity, and the results have greatly enriched our\nunderstanding of superfluidity. Here we review these developments by focusing\non the stability and critical velocity of various superfluids. The BEC systems\nconsidered include a uniform superfluid in free space, a superfluid with its\ndensity periodically modulated, a superfluid with artificially engineered\nspin-orbit coupling, and a superfluid of pure spin current. Due to the weak\ninteraction, these BEC systems can be well described by the mean field\nGross-Pitaevskii theory and their superfluidity, in particular critical\nvelocities, can be examined with Landau's theory of superfluid.

In this paper we study the problem of fair spectrum\nallocation across multiple NCOFDM-enabled point-to-point cognitive radio links\nunder certain practical considerations that arise from such non-contiguous\naccess. When using NC-OFDMA, the channels allocated to a cognitive link are\nspread across several disjoint frequency bands leading to a large spectral span\nfor that link. Increased spectral span requires higher sampling rates, leading\nto increased power consumption in the ADC/DAC of the transmit/receive nodes.

Under constant transmit powers and\northogonal spectrum allocation, such an optimization is a mixed-integer linear\nprogram and can be solved efficiently.

Thus, the application of such a model to AGNs\nfails to produce their observed X-ray emission. As a consequence, a fraction of\ndisk accretion energy is usually assumed to be transferred to the corona. To\navoid this assumption, we propose that gas in a vertically extended\ndistribution is supplied to a supermassive black hole by the gravitational\ncapture of interstellar medium or stellar wind material. In this picture, the\ngas partially condenses to an underlying cool disk as it flows toward the black\nhole, releasing accretion energy as X-ray emission and supplying mass for the\ndisk accretion.

While the later route is very challenging, requiring\nvery precise theory and experiment, it allows a much higher resolution of short\ndistance scales than it is possible with the help of the LHC. In fact in the\ncoming flavour precision era, in which the accuracy of the measurements of rare\nprocesses and of the relevant lattice QCD calculations will be significantly\nincreased, there is a good chance that we may get an insight into the scales as\nshort as 10^{-21} m (Zeptouniverse) corresponding to energy scale of 200 TeV or\neven shorter distance scales. We discuss the requirements that have to be met\nfor such a flavour expedition to the Zeptouniverse to be successful. In\nparticular we emphasize the power of correlations between flavour observables\nin the search for New Physics and identify a number of correlations that could\nallow to discover NP even if it would appear at the level of 20% of the SM\ncontributions.

The\nfirst one is a high performance scheme, which benefits from optimized source\nand channel rate adaptation. In the second scheme, the channel coding rate is\nfixed and optimized along with transmission power with respect to channel and\nsource variations; hence this scheme enjoys simplicity of implementation. The\ntwo last schemes have fixed transmission power with optimized adaptive or fixed\nchannel coding rate. For all the proposed schemes, closed form solutions for\nmean distortion, optimized rate and power are provided and in the high SNR\nregime, the mean distortion exponent and the asymptotic mean power gains are\nderived. The proposed schemes with buffering exploit the diversity due to\nsource and channel variations.

Furthermore, analytical and numerical results demonstrate that\nwith limited buffer size, the system performance in terms of reconstructed\nsignal SNR saturates as transmission power is increased, suggesting that\nappropriate buffer size selection is important to achieve a desired\nreconstruction quality.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1202.6175"]}]
