Instead of estimating the conditional\ndistribution of the response given values of covariates, we model the\nconditional distribution of covariates given the discretized response (aka\n\"slices\"). By assigning a prior probability to each possible discretization\nscheme, we can compute efficiently a Bayes factor (BF)-statistic for the\nindependence (or conditional independence) test using a dynamic programming\nalgorithm. Asymptotic and finite-sample properties such as power and null\ndistribution of the BF statistic are studied, and a stepwise variable selection\nmethod based on the BF statistic is further developed. We compare the BF\nstatistic with some existing classical methods and demonstrate its statistical\npower through extensive simulation studies.

This situation was changed in 1995, when a new superfluid was\nborn with the realization of the Bose-Einstein condensation in ultracold atomic\ngases. The liquid helium 4 is strongly interacting and has no spin; there is\nalmost no way to change its parameters, such as interaction strength and\ndensity. The new superfluid, Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), offers various\naspects of advantages over liquid helium. On the one hand, BEC is weakly\ninteracting and has spin degrees of freedom. On the other hand, it is\nconvenient to tune almost all the parameters of a BEC, for example, the kinetic\nenergy by spin-orbit coupling, the density by the external potential, and the\ninteraction by Feshbach resonance. Great efforts have been devoted to studying\nthese new aspects of superfluidity, and the results have greatly enriched our\nunderstanding of superfluidity. Here we review these developments by focusing\non the stability and critical velocity of various superfluids. The BEC systems\nconsidered include a uniform superfluid in free space, a superfluid with its\ndensity periodically modulated, a superfluid with artificially engineered\nspin-orbit coupling, and a superfluid of pure spin current. Due to the weak\ninteraction, these BEC systems can be well described by the mean field\nGross-Pitaevskii theory and their superfluidity, in particular critical\nvelocities, can be examined with Landau's theory of superfluid.

Non-contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing\n(NC-OFDM) is a promising technique to utilize such disjoint frequency bands in\nan efficient manner. In this paper we study the problem of fair spectrum\nallocation across multiple NCOFDM-enabled point-to-point cognitive radio links\nunder certain practical considerations that arise from such non-contiguous\naccess. When using NC-OFDMA, the channels allocated to a cognitive link are\nspread across several disjoint frequency bands leading to a large spectral span\nfor that link. Increased spectral span requires higher sampling rates, leading\nto increased power consumption in the ADC/DAC of the transmit/receive nodes. In\nthis context, this paper proposes a spectrum allocation that maximizes the\nminimum rate achieved by the cognitive radio links, under a constraint on the\nmaximum permissible spectral span. Under constant transmit powers and\northogonal spectrum allocation, such an optimization is a mixed-integer linear\nprogram and can be solved efficiently. There exists a clear trade-off between\nthe max-min rate achieved and the maximum permissible spectral span.

In our model stochastic\nprocesses govern all events. A major novelty of this approach is that it\npermits studying random variations in the immune process. Four basic components\nare simulated in the model: non-immune self cells, nonself cells (pathogens), B\nlymphocytes, and bone marrow cells that produce naive B lymphocytes. A point in\na generalized shape space plus the size of the corresponding population\nrepresents nonself and non-immune self cells. On the other hand, each\nindividual B cell is represented by a disc that models its recognition region\nin the shape space. Infection is simulated by an \"injection\" of nonself cells\ninto the system. Division of pathogens may instigate an attack of naive B\ncells, which in turn may induce clonal proliferation and hypermutation in the\nattacking B cells, and which eventually may slow down and stop the exponential\ngrowth of pathogens. Affinity maturation of newly produced B cells becomes\nexpressed as a result of selection when the number of pathogens decreases.\nUnder favorable conditions, the expanded primary B cell clones may stimulate\nthe expansion of secondary B cell clones carrying complementary receptors to\nthe stimulating B cells. Like in a hall of mirrors, the image of pathogens in\nthe primary B cell clones then will be reflected in secondary B cell clones.\nThis \"ping-pong\" game may survive for a long time even in the absence of the\npathogen, creating a local network memory.

To address this gap, we propose\na scalable and flexible novel Bayesian approach for estimation and model\nselection in Gaussian undirected graphical models.

The class of\nGeneralized Bartlett graphs contains the class of decomposable graphs as a\nspecial case, but is substantially larger than the class of decomposable\ngraphs. We proceed to derive theoretical properties of the proposed Gibbs\nsampler.
