Unlike in the linear\nsetting where Rayleigh quotient optimization coincides with classification,\nthese two problems are very different under nonlinear settings. In this paper,\nwe clarify this difference and show that Rayleigh quotient optimization may be\nof independent scientific interests. One major challenge of Rayleigh quotient\noptimization is that the variance of quadratic statistics involves all fourth\ncross-moments of predictors, which are infeasible to compute for\nhigh-dimensional applications and may accumulate too many stochastic errors.\nThis issue is resolved by considering a family of elliptical models. Moreover,\nfor heavy-tail distributions, robust estimates of mean vectors and covariance\nmatrices are employed to guarantee uniform convergence in estimating\nnonpolynomially many parameters, even though only the fourth moments are\nassumed. Methodologically, QUADRO is based on elliptical models which allow us\nto formulate the Rayleigh quotient maximization as a convex optimization\nproblem. Computationally, we propose an efficient linearized augmented\nLagrangian method to solve the constrained optimization problem.

While\nwalking on the streets, pedestrians can be aware of attractions like shopping\nwindows. They can be influenced by the attractions and some of them might shift\ntheir attention towards the attractions, namely switching behavior. As a first\nstep to incorporate the switching behavior, this study investigates collective\neffects of switching behavior for an attraction by developing a behavioral\nmodel. Numerical simulations exhibit different patterns of pedestrian behavior\ndepending on the strength of the social influence and the average length of\nstay. When the social influence is strong along with a long length of stay, a\nsaturated phase can be defined at which all the pedestrians have visited the\nattraction. If the social influence is not strong enough, an unsaturated phase\nappears where one can observe that some pedestrians head for the attraction\nwhile others walk in their desired direction. These collective patterns of\npedestrian behavior are summarized in a phase diagram by comparing the number\nof pedestrians who visited the attraction to the number of passersby near the\nattraction. Measuring the marginal benefits with respect to the strength of the\nsocial influence and the average length of stay enables us to identify under\nwhat conditions enhancing these variables would be more effective.

Longitudinal data represent an interesting field of\napplication of such models; due to their peculiar features, they represent a\nsubstantial challenge, in that the standard, cross-sectional, model\nrepresentation needs to be extended for dealing with such kind of data. In\nfact, repeated observations from the same statistical unit poses a problem of\ndependence; in a conditional perspective, this dependence could be ascribed to\nsources of unobserved, individual-specific, heterogeneity. Along these lines,\nquantile regression models have recently been extended to the analysis of\nlongitudinal, continuous, responses, by modelling dependence via time-constant\nor time-varying random effects. In this manuscript, we introduce a general\nquantile regression model for longitudinal, continuous, responses where\ntime-varying and time-constant random parameters are jointly taken into\naccount. A further feature of longitudinal designs is the presence of partially\nincomplete sequences, due to some individuals leaving the study before its\ndesigned end. The missing data process may produce a selection of units which\ncan be informative with respect to the parameters of the longitudinal data\nmodel. To deal with the case of irretrievable drop-out, we introduce a pattern\nmixture version of the linear quantile hidden Markov model, where we account\nfor time-varying heterogeneity and for changes in the fixed effect vector due\nto differential propensities to stay in the study.

The new\ncontributions are chiral in that they act in opposite directions in plasmas\ncontaining an excess of left- or right-handed quarks and in that they are\nproportional to the coefficient of the axial anomaly. These new contributions\nto the drag force act either parallel to or antiparallel to an external\nmagnetic field or to the vorticity of the fluid plasma. In all these respects,\nthese contributions to the drag force felt by a heavy quark are analogous to\nthe chiral magnetic effect on light quarks. However, the new contribution to\nthe drag force is independent of the electric charge of the heavy quark and is\nthe same for heavy quarks and antiquarks. We show that although the chiral drag\nforce can be non-vanishing for heavy quarks that are at rest in the local fluid\nrest frame, it does vanish for heavy quarks that are at rest in a suitably\nchosen frame. In this frame, the heavy quark at rest sees counterpropagating\nmomentum and charge currents, both proportional to the axial anomaly\ncoefficient, but feels no drag force. This provides strong concrete evidence\nfor the absence of dissipation in chiral transport, something that has been\npredicted previously via consideration of symmetries. Along the way to our\nprincipal results, we provide a general calculation of the corrections to the\ndrag force due to the presence of gradients in the flowing fluid in the\npresence of a nonzero chemical potential.

Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally\nfriendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium,\n2) conservative, and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium\nand conservative EVs are considered to be interested only in charging their\nbatteries, with noticeably higher rate of charging for premium EVs. Green\nvehicles are more environmentally friendly, and thus assist the CS to reduce\nits cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as\ndistributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of\nEV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed\ninteger programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed\nclassification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be\neffectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy\ntrading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data\nare used for performance analysis of the system.

In\nparticular, we measure the shear rheology of a model system - a suspension of\nglass beads with an average diameter of $\\sim$ 7 {\\mu}m - at solid volume\nfractions {\\phi} $\\gtrsim$ 0.40. We show that recent insights into the role of\ninter-particle friction in suspension rheology allow us to use flow data to\npredict some of the boundaries between different types of granulation as {\\phi}\nincreases from $\\sim$ 0.4 towards and beyond the maximum packing point of\nrandom close packing.\n","Comment: This paper was submitted for presentation at the 7th International\n  Granulation Workshop (2015), Sheffield (1st - 3rd July 2015), paper number 53"]}]

Linear\ninterference of waves with random phase has often been cited as one possible\nexplanation, but apparently does not satisfactorily explain the probability of\nextreme events in the ocean. Other explanations therefore suggested a decisive\nrole of a nonlinearity in the system. Here we show that linear interference of\na finite and variable number of waves may very well explain the heavy tail in\nthe wave height distribution. Our model can explain all prototypical ocean\nrogue waves reported so far, including the \"three sisters\" as well as rogue\nholes.

The\nfrequency of those oscillations are related to the brain functions. However,\nlittle is know about how the oscillating frequency of neural system affects\nneural information transmission in them. In this paper, we investigated how the\nsignal processing in single neuron is modulated by subthreshold membrane\npotential oscillation generated by upstream rhythmic neural activities. We\nfound that the high frequency oscillations facilitate the transferring of\nstrong signals, whereas slow oscillations the weak signals. Though the capacity\nof information convey for weak signal is low in single neuron, it is greatly\nenhanced when weak signals are transferred by multiple pathways with different\noscillation phases. We provided a simple phase plane analysis to explain the\nmechanism for this stimulus-dependent frequency modulation in the leakage\nintegrate-and-fire neuron model. Those results provided a basic understanding\nof how the brain could modulate its information processing simply through\noscillating frequency.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures"]}]
