In the\nfirst class you get to know Schroedinger's equation and find the form and\ndynamics of simple physical systems (square well, harmonic oscillator, hydrogen\natom); most calculations are analytic and inspired by calculations originally\ndone in the 1920s and 1930s. In the second class you learn about large systems\nsuch as molecular structures, crystalline solids, or lattice models; these\ncalculations are usually so complicated that it is difficult for the student to\nunderstand them in all detail.\n  This lecture tries to bridge the gap between simple analytic calculations and\ncomplicated large-scale computations. We will revisit most of the problems\nencountered in introductory quantum mechanics, focusing on computer\nimplementations for finding analytical as well as numerical solutions and their\nvisualization.\n  Most of these calculations are too complicated to be done by hand. Even\nrelatively simple problems, such as two interacting particles in a\none-dimensional trap, do not have analytic solutions and require the use of\ncomputers for their solution and visualization.

We introduce a simple\nmodification for autoencoder neural networks that yields powerful generative\nmodels. Our method masks the autoencoder's parameters to respect autoregressive\nconstraints: each input is reconstructed only from previous inputs in a given\nordering. Constrained this way, the autoencoder outputs can be interpreted as a\nset of conditional probabilities, and their product, the full joint\nprobability. We can also train a single network that can decompose the joint\nprobability in multiple different orderings. Our simple framework can be\napplied to multiple architectures, including deep ones. Vectorized\nimplementations, such as on GPUs, are simple and fast. Experiments demonstrate\nthat this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art tractable distribution\nestimators. At test time, the method is significantly faster and scales better\nthan other autoregressive estimators.\n","Comment: 9 pages and 1 page of supplementary material.

Two possible ways out are: i) To extend GMSB by direct\nsuperpotential messenger-MSSM Yukawa couplings to generate sizeable mixing,\nthus reintroducing the flavor problem; ii) To extend the MSSM Higgs sector with\nsinglets and/or triplets providing extra tree-level corrections to the Higgs\nmass.

However, such lossy models\nrequire an additional mechanism for pumping energy to the system to control the\nlocomotion and to reach a limit-cycle. Some studies solved this problem by\nadding an actively controllable torque actuation at the hip joint and this\nactuation has been successively used in many robotic platforms, such as the\npopular RHex robot. However, hip torque actuation produces forces on the COM\ndominantly at forward direction with respect to ground, making height control\nchallenging especially at slow speeds.

To this end, we propose an\nextension of the lossy SLIP model with a slider-crank mechanism, SLIP- SCM,\nthat can generate a stable limit-cycle when the body is constrained to vertical\ndirection. We propose an approximate analytical solution to the nonlinear\nsystem dynamics of SLIP- SCM model to characterize its behavior during the\nlocomotion.

The types of singularities that occur in this context have been\nstudied by Mori, Koll\\'ar, Reid, and others, beginning in the 1980s with the\nintroduction of the minimal model program. Normal singularities that are\nterminal, canonical, log terminal, and log canonical, and their non-normal\ncounterparts, are typically studied using a resolution of singularities (or a\nsemiresolution) and finding numerical conditions that relate the canonical\nclass of the variety to that of its resolution. In order to do this, it has\nbeen assumed that a variety $X$ has a $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class:\nsome multiple $mK_X$ of the canonical class is Cartier. In particular, this\ndivisor can be pulled back under a resolution $f: Y \\rightarrow X$ by pulling\nback its local sections. Then one has a relation $K_Y \\sim \\frac{1}{m}f^*(mK_X)\n+ \\sum a_iE_i$. It is then the coefficients of the exceptional divisors $E_i$\nthat determine the type of singularities that belong to $X$. It might be asked\nwhether this $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier hypothesis is necessary in studying\nsingularities in birational classification. In \\cite{dFH09}, de Fernex and\nHacon construct a boundary divisor $\\Delta$ for arbitrary normal varieties, the\nresulting divisor $K_X + \\Delta$ being $\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier even though $K_X$\nitself is not. This they call (for reasons that will be made clear) an\n$m$-compatible boundary for $X$, and they proceed to show that the\nsingularities defined in terms of the pair $(X, \\Delta)$ are none other than\nthe singularities just described, when $K_X$ happens to be\n$\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier. In the present paper, we extend the results of\n\\cite{dFH09} still further, to include demi-normal varieties without a\n$\\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier canonical class.\n"]}]
