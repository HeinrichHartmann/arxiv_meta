The key ideas involved in the method\ninclude: (i) employing a higher-order spectral finite-element basis that is\namenable to mesh adaption; (ii) using a Chebyshev filter to construct a\nsubspace which is an approximation to the occupied eigenspace in a given\nself-consistent field iteration; (iii) using a localization procedure to\nconstruct a non-orthogonal localized basis spanning the Chebyshev filtered\nsubspace; (iv) using a Fermi-operator expansion in terms of the\nsubspace-projected Hamiltonian represented in the non-orthogonal localized\nbasis to compute relevant quantities like the density matrix, electron density\nand band energy.

The rate at\nwhich MRI-driven turbulence transports angular momentum is related to both the\nstrength of the amplitudes of the fluctuations on various scales and the degree\nof anisotropy of the underlying turbulence. This has motivated several studies\nof the distribution of turbulent power in spectral space. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the anisotropic nature of MRI-driven turbulence using a\npseudo-spectral code and introduce novel ways to robustly characterize the\nunderlying turbulence. We show that the general flow properties vary in a\nquasi-periodic way on timescales comparable to 10 inverse angular frequencies\nmotivating the temporal analysis of its anisotropy. We introduce a 3D tensor\ninvariant analysis to quantify and classify the evolution of the anisotropic\nturbulent flow. This analysis shows a continuous high level of anisotropy, with\nbrief sporadic transitions towards two- and three-component isotropic turbulent\nflow. This temporal-dependent anisotropy renders standard shell-average,\nespecially when used simultaneously with long temporal averages, inadequate for\ncharacterizing MRI-driven turbulence. We propose an alternative way to extract\nspectral information from the turbulent magnetized flow, whose anisotropic\ncharacter depends strongly on time. This consists of stacking 1D Fourier\nspectra along three orthogonal directions that exhibit maximum anisotropy in\nFourier space. The resulting averaged spectra show that the power along each of\nthe three independent directions differs by several orders of magnitude over\nmost scales, except the largest ones.

I describe here a new membrane approach to\ntidal perturbations based on the general theory of viscoelastic-gravitational\ndeformations of spherically symmetric bodies. The massive membrane approach\nleads to explicit formulas for viscoelastic tidal Love numbers which are exact\nin the limit of zero crust thickness. Formulas for load Love numbers come as a\nbonus. The accuracy on $k_2$ and $h_2$ is better than one percent if the crust\nthickness is less than five percents of the surface radius, which is probably\nthe case for Europa and Titan. The new approach allows for density differences\nbetween crust and ocean and correctly includes crust compressibility. This last\nfeature makes it more accurate than the incompressible propagator matrix\nmethod. Membrane formulas factorize shallow and deep interior contributions,\nthe latter affecting Love numbers mainly through density stratification. I show\nthat a screening effect explains why ocean stratification typically increases\nLove numbers instead of reducing them. For Titan, a thin and dense liquid layer\nat the bottom of a light ocean can raise $k_2$ by more than ten percents. The\nmembrane approach can also deal with dynamical tides in a non-rotating body. I\nshow that a dynamical resonance significantly decreases the tilt factor and may\nthus lead to underestimating Europa's crust thickness. Finally, the dynamical\nresonance increases tidal deformations and tidal heating in the crust if the\nocean thickness is of the order of a few hundred meters.\n","Comment: 71 pages, 15 figures, 11 tables, submitted to Icarus.

This deceptively simple question has important consequences\nfor ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo\ndramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of\nthese shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states.\nUnfortunately, the concept of stability in ecology has suffered from\nsubstantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where\nstochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable\nstates. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a\nball-in-cup diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the\nposition of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push\nthe ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by\na potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. However,\nsystems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite\nrare. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other\napproaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear\nstability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and,\nas we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will\nbehave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how\nthe potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly,\nemploying a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential. Using\nthree classic ecological models, we demonstrate that the quasi-potential\nprovides a useful way to quantify stability in stochastic systems.\n"]}]

This\nimplies that the hydrostatic SIS initial condition leading to Shu's classical\ninside-out solution is not expected to occur, and therefore neither should the\ninside-out solution.

In view of a lack of radio eclipses and an optical\nnon-detection, the system most likely has a low orbital inclination.

Based on a basic first-order\naverage-consensus protocol, this paper estimates its fastest convergence rate\nunder unknown switching network topologies and additive noises. It is shown\nthat the fastest convergence rate is of the order 1/t for the best topologies,\nand for the worst topologies which are balanced and uniformly jointly\nconnected. This implies for any balanced and uniformly jointly connected\ntopologies, the fastest convergence rate is of the order 1/t. Another effort of\nthis paper is to investigate the critical topological condition for consensus\nof this protocol. We propose a new joint-connectivity condition called\nextensible joint-connectivity that contains a parameter \\delta (termed as an\nextensible exponent). Using this condition we show the critical value of \\delta\nfor consensus is 1/2, and prove the fastest convergence speed is of the order\nt^{1-2\\delta}, which quantitatively describes a relation between the\nconvergence speed and connectivity. Also, the extensible joint-connectivity can\nbe used to deal with the system whose network topology affects complex\nuncertainty, such as the consensus analysis of the system with non stationary\nand strongly correlated stochastic topologies.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 0 figure"]}]
