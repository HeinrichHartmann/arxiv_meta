One explanation for this decrease in angle relies on the\nassumption that a ship cannot generate wavelengths much greater than its hull\nlength. An alternative interpretation is that the wave pattern that is observed\nin practice is defined by the location of the highest peaks; for wakes created\nby sufficiently fast-moving objects, these highest peaks no longer lie on the\noutermost divergent waves, resulting in a smaller apparent angle. In this\npaper, we focus on the problems of free surface flow past a single submerged\npoint source and past a submerged source doublet. In the linear version of\nthese problems, we measure the apparent wake angle formed by the highest peaks,\nand observe the following three regimes: a small Froude number pattern, in\nwhich the divergent waves are not visible; standard wave patterns for which the\nmaximum peaks occur on the outermost divergent waves; and a third regime in\nwhich the highest peaks form a V-shape with an angle much less than the Kelvin\nangle. For nonlinear flows, we demonstrate that nonlinearity has the effect of\nincreasing the apparent wake angle so that some highly nonlinear solutions have\napparent wake angles that are greater than Kelvin's angle. For large Froude\nnumbers, the effect on apparent wake angle can be more dramatic, with the\npossibility of strong nonlinearity shifting the wave pattern from the third\nregime to the second.

In the streamer context, the\nrelevant regularisation on the interface is not provided by surface tension,\nbut instead has been postulated to involve a mechanism equivalent to kinetic\nundercooling, which acts to penalise high velocities and prevent blow-up of the\nunregularised solution. Previous asymptotic results for the Hele-Shaw finger\nproblem with kinetic undercooling suggest that for a given value of the kinetic\nundercooling parameter, there is a discrete set of possible finger shapes, each\nanalytic at the nose and occupying a different fraction of the channel width.\nIn the limit in which the kinetic undercooling parameter vanishes, the fraction\nfor each family approaches 1/2, suggesting that this 'selection' of 1/2 by\nkinetic undercooling is qualitatively similar to the well-known analogue with\nsurface tension. We treat the numerical problem of computing these\nSaffman-Taylor fingers with kinetic undercooling, which turns out to be more\nsubtle than the analogue with surface tension, since kinetic undercooling\npermits finger shapes which are corner-free but not analytic.

The destruction of the fan-spine topology\nowing to the interaction between its magnetic fields and an nearby emerging\nflux region (EFR) is firstly observed. The line-of-sight magnetograms from the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the SDO reveal that the dome is\nlocated on the mixed magnetic fields, with its rim rooted in the redundant\npositive polarity surrounding the minority parasitic negative fields.

The jet occurring around 13:54 UT is accompanied with\na quasi-circular ribbon that brightens in the clockwise direction along the\nbottom rim of the dome, which may indicate an occurrence of slipping\nreconnection in the fan-spine topology. The EFR emerges continuously and meets\nwith the magnetic fields of the dome.
