Each RLP is obtained by means of the Liouville\ntransformation (LT) of the appropriate rational canonical Sturm-Liouville\nequation (RCSLE) with second-order poles.

It is proven that the CLDT preserves the rational form of the RCSLE\nif its factorization function (FF) is an almost-everywhere holomorphic (AEH)\nsolution of the RCSLE (or, in other words, a solution with a rational\nlogarithmic derivative). As explained in the paper there are up to four gauge\ntransformations which convert each RCSLE of our interest into the second-order\ndifferential equations with energy-dependent polynomial coefficients. The most\nimportant result of the paper is that polynomial solutions of these equations\nbelong to sequences of Heine polynomials obtained by varying free terms at\nfixed values of singular points and the appropriate characteristic exponents.\nThis allows us to construct networks of polynomial solutions -- the so-called\n\"r-, c-, or i-Gauss-seed\" (r-, c-, or i-GS) Heine polynomials -- starting from\nJacobi, (generalized) Laguerre or Routh polynomials, respectively.\n","Comment: 112 pages, 1 figure"]}]

Here, I show that\nquantum decoherence offers a window into otherwise inaccessible realms. There\nis a standard quantum limit for diffusion that restricts some\nentanglement-generating phenomena, like soft collisions with new particle\nspecies, from having appreciable classical influence on normal matter. Such\nphenomena are classically undetectable but can be revealed by the anomalous\ndecoherence they induce on non-classical superpositions with long-range\ncoherence in phase space. This gives strong, novel motivation for the\nconstruction of matter interferometers and other experimental sources of large\nsuperpositions, which recently have seen rapid progress. Decoherence is always\nat least second order in the coupling strength, so such searches are best\nsuited for soft interactions (e.g., small momentum transfers), but not weak\nones (i.e., small coupling constants).\n","Comment: Published version"]}]

The central question in this geometric context is, which\nconditions on the k-dimensional facets of an n-simplex S guarantee that S has\nno obtuse dihedral angles. First we study the properties of an n-simplex S\nwhose k-facets are all nonobtuse, and generalize some classical results by\nFiedler. We prove that if all (n-1)-facets of an n-simplex S are nonobtuse,\neach makes at most one obtuse dihedral angle with another facet. This helps to\nidentify a special type of tetrahedron, which we will call sub-orthocentric,\nwith the property that if all tetrahedral facets of S are sub-orthocentric,\nthen S is nonobtuse. Rephrased in the language of linear algebra, this\nconstitutes a purely geometric proof of the fact that each symmetric\nultrametric matrix is the inverse of a weakly diagonally dominant M-matrix.\n  Review papers support our belief that the linear algebraic perspective on the\ninverse M-matrix problem dominates the literature. The geometric perspective\nhowever connects sign properties of entries of inverses of a symmetric positive\ndefinite matrix to the dihedral angle properties of an underlying simplex, and\nenables an explicit visualization of how these angles and signs can be\nmanipulated. This will serve to formulate purely geometric conditions on the\nk-facets of an n-simplex S that may render S nonobtuse also for k>3. For this,\nwe generalize the class of sub-orthocentric tetrahedra that gives rise to the\nclass of ultrametric matrices, to sub-orthocentric simplices that define\nsymmetric positive definite matrices A with special types of k x k principal\nsubmatrices for k>3. Each sub-orthocentric simplices is nonobtuse, and we\nconjecture that any simplex with sub-orthocentric facets only, is\nsub-orthocentric itself.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 20 figures"]}]
