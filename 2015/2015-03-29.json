Physarum networks also\nexhibit computationally desirable measures of transport efficiency in terms of\noverall path length, minimal connectivity and network resilience. Although\nsignificant progress has been made in mathematically modelling the behaviour of\nPhysarum networks (and other biological transport networks) based on observed\nfeatures in experimental settings, their initial emergence - and in particular\ntheir long-term persistence and evolution - is still poorly understood. We\npresent a low-level, bottom-up, approach to the modelling of emergent transport\nnetworks. A population of simple particle-like agents coupled with paracrine\nchemotaxis behaviours in a dissipative environment results in the spontaneous\nemergence of persistent, complex structures. Second order emergent behaviours,\nin the form of network surface minimisation, are also observed contributing to\nthe long term evolution and dynamics of the networks. The framework is extended\nto allow data presentation and the population is used to perform a direct\n(spatial) approximation of network minimisation problems.
