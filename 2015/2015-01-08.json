Three main modulating\nfactors affecting the optical response are identified: the near-field\ndistribution at the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic, how SH light\ncouples to the diffraction orders of the lattice, and its propagation\nproperties inside the holes. It is shown that light generated at the second\nharmonic can excite electromagnetic modes otherwise inaccessible in the linear\nregime under normal incidence illumination. It is demonstrated that the\nemission of SH radiation is only allowed along off-normal paths precisely due\nto that symmetry. Two different regimes are studied in the context of\nextraordinary optical transmission, where enhanced linear transmission either\noccurs through localized electromagnetic modes or is aided by surface plasmon\npolaritons (SPPs). While localized resonances in metallic hole arrays have been\npreviously investigated, the role played by SPPs in SH generation has not been\naddressed so far. In general, good agreement is found between our calculations\n(based on the finite difference time domain method) and the experimental\nresults on localized resonances, even though no free fitting parameters were\nused in describing the materials. It is found that SH emission is strongly\nmodulated by enhanced fields at the fundamental wavelength (either localized or\nsurface plasmon modes) on the glass metal interface.

Local non-equilibrium properties are\npresented for interaction quenches and hybridization quenches. We augment our\nnumerical data by an analytical calculation that becomes exact at short times\nand find excellent agreement between the numerics and the analytical theory.\nFor interaction quenches within the screened phase we find a universal function\nfor the time-dependent local double occupancy. We trace back the discrepancy\nbetween our results and the data obtained by a time-dependent Gutzwiller\nvariational approach to restrictions of the wave-function ansatz in the\nGutzwiller theory: while the NRG ground states properly account for the\nformation of an extended spin moment which decouples from the system in the\nunscreened phase, the Gutzwiller ansatz only allows the formation of the spin\nmoment on the local impurity orbital.\n"]}]

We address some properties of this type of systems by using a\nSlater-Koster tight-binding model. We predict that topological\nsuperconductivity is nearly universal when ferromagnetic transition metal\nchains form straight lines on superconducting substrates and that it is\npossible for more complex chain structures. The proximity induced\nsuperconducting gap is $\\sim \\Delta E_{so} / J$ where $\\Delta$ is the $s$-wave\npair-potential on the chain, $E_{so}$ is the spin-orbit splitting energy\ninduced in the normal chain state bands by hybridization with the\nsuperconducting substrate, and $J$ is the exchange-splitting of the\nferromagnetic chain $d$-bands. Because of the topological character of the 1D\nsuperconducting state, Majorana end modes appear within the gaps of finite\nlength chains. We find, in agreement with experiment, that when the chain and\nsubstrate orbitals are strongly hybridized, Majorana end modes are\nsubstantially reduced in amplitude when separated from the chain end by less\nthan the coherence length defined by the $p$-wave superconducting gap. We\nconclude that Pb is a particularly favorable substrate material for\nferromagnetic chain topological superconductivity because it provides both\nstrong $s-$wave pairing and strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling, but that there\nis an opportunity to optimize properties by varying the atomic composition and\nstructure of the chain.

The host star is of G5\nspectral type, with magnitude V=11.2, and lies 125+/-80 pc distant. We find\nstellar parameters of T_eff=5685+/-65 K, super-solar metallicity\n([Fe/H]=0.08+/-0.10), M_star=1.04+/-0.07 M_sun and R_star=0.96+/-0.13 R_sun.\nThe system has a K-dwarf binary companion, WASP-85B, at a separation of\napproximately 1.5\". The close proximity of this companion leads to\ncontamination of our photometry, decreasing the apparent transit depth that we\naccount for during our analysis. Without this correction, we find the depth to\nbe 50 percent smaller, the stellar density to be 32 percent smaller, and the\nplanet radius to be 18 percent smaller than the true value. Many of our radial\nvelocity observations are also contaminated; these are disregarded when\nanalysing the system in favour of the uncontaminated HARPS observations, as\nthey have reduced semi-amplitudes that lead to underestimated planetary masses.\nWe find a long-term trend in the binary position angle, indicating a\nmisalignment between the binary and orbital planes. WASP observations of the\nsystem show variability with a period of 14.64 days, indicative of rotational\nmodulation caused by stellar activity. Analysis of the Ca ii H+K lines shows\nstrong emission that implies that both binary components are strongly active.\nWe find that the system is likely to be less than a few Gyr old. WASP-85 lies\nin the field of view of K2 Campaign 1. Long cadence observations of the planet\nclearly show the planetary transits, along with the signature of stellar\nvariability. Analysis of the K2 data, both long and short cadence, is ongoing.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables Replacement to correct typos and update\n  a couple of references"]}]

By adopting a\nrather strict definition of correctness - guaranteeing that honest players\nobtain their correct outcomes only - we can show that every strictly correct\nquantum protocol implementing a non-trivial classical primitive necessarily\nleaks information to a dishonest player. This extends known impossibility\nresults to all non-trivial primitives. We provide a framework for quantifying\nthis leakage and argue that leakage is a good measure for the privacy provided\nto the players by a given protocol. Our framework also covers the case where\nthe two players are helped by a trusted third party. We show that despite the\nhelp of a trusted third party, the players cannot amplify the cryptographic\npower of any primitive. All our results hold even against quantum\nhonest-but-curious adversaries who honestly follow the protocol but purify\ntheir actions and apply a different measurement at the end of the protocol. As\nconcrete examples, we establish lower bounds on the leakage of standard\nuniversal two-party primitives such as oblivious transfer.\n","Comment: 38 pages, completely supersedes arXiv:0902.4036"]}]
