A powerful and\nwidespread class of network analysis methods is based on algebraic graph\ntheory, i.e., representing graphs as square adjacency matrices.

We consider\na wide range of turbulent intensities and system sizes, corresponding to the\nDamk\\\"ohler numbers Da = 0.1-6.0.

In particular, we find\nthree effects. 1) Turbulent flame speed develops pulsations with the observed\npeak-to-peak amplitude > 10 and a characteristic time scale close to a\nlarge-scale eddy turnover time. Such variability is caused by the interplay\nbetween turbulence, which continuously creates the flame surface, and highly\nintermittent flame collisions, which consume the flame surface. 2) Unstable\nburning results in the periodic pressure build-up and the formation of pressure\nwaves or shocks, when the flame speed approaches or exceeds the speed of a\nChapman-Jouguet deflagration. 3) Coupling of pressure gradients formed during\npulsations with density gradients across the flame leads to the anisotropic\namplification of turbulence inside the flame volume and flame acceleration.\nSuch process, which is driven by the baroclinic term in the vorticity transport\nequation, is a reacting-flow analog of the mechanism underlying the\nRichtmyer-Meshkov instability.

Although H$_2$O on rutile TiO$_2$(110) has been\nthoroughly studied both experimentally and theoretically, a quantitative value\nfor the energy of the highest H$_2$O occupied levels is still lacking. For\nexperiment, this is due to the H$_2$O levels being obscured by hybridization\nwith TiO$_2$(110) levels in the difference spectra obtained via ultraviolet\nphotoemission spectroscopy (UPS). For theory, this is due to inherent\ndifficulties in properly describing many-body effects at the\nH$_2$O-TiO$_2$(110) interface. Using the projected density of states (DOS) from\nstate-of-the-art quasiparticle (QP) $G_0W_0$, we disentangle the adsorbate and\nsurface contributions to the complex UPS spectra of H$_2$O on TiO$_2$(110).

Due to hybridization with the TiO$_2$(110)\nsurface, the H$_2$O 3a$_1$ and 1b$_1$ levels are broadened into several peaks\nbetween 5 and 1 eV below the TiO$_2$(110) valence band maximum (VBM).

The main results can be split into three parts. The\nresults of the first part guarantee that each \"unit distance graph\" in the\nplane has an induced subgraph with chromatic number at most 4 that covers at\nleast 91.7 percent of the vertices of the whole graph.\n  The results of the second and third parts are related to the standard model\nof a random graph with n labeled vertices in which the edges occur\nindependently with probability p, where p is a function of n. This is known as\nthe Erdos--Renyi model G(n,p). Given a monotone property of a graph, Erdos and\nRenyi's theorem (1960) states that there exists a critical threshold value of\np(n) below which the probability that a random graph has that property tends to\none (as n tends to infinity) and above which the probability tends to zero.\n  The main results of the second part are concerned with the (monotone)\nproperty of a graph to be isomorphic to some unit-distance graph in Euclidean\nd-space with fixed dimension d. The results of this part guarantee that for d\nin {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, the threshold value of p(n) is big-Theta of 1/n.\nFurthermore, the case d = 1 stands apart from the case of higher dimensions;\nhere the threshold probability is big-Theta of 1/(n^(4/3)).\n  The results of the third part are devoted to studying \"graphs of diameters\"\nfrom the probabilistic standpoint. In particular, it is shown that under some\nconditions, almost all graphs of diameters in the plane have chromatic number\nless than 3. More generally, it is shown for G(n,p) that graphs of diameters\nhave a tendency to chromatic degeneration (for large n) when p is close to 0,\nbut have a tendency to completeness when p is close to 1.\n","Comment: 16 pages, in Russian, candidate-degree dissertation author's review,\n  Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (State University), November 2014,\n  adviser: A.
