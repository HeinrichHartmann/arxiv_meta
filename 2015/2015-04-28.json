A common approach is to estimate demand for sizes directly from the\nsales data. This approach may yield information for the demand for sizes if\naggregated over all branches and products. However, as we will show in a\nreal-world business case, this direct approach is in general not capable to\nprovide information about each branch's individual demand for sizes: the supply\nper branch is so small that either the number of sales is statistically too\nsmall for a good estimate (early measurement) or there will be too much\nunsatisfied demand neglected in the sales data (late measurement). Moreover, in\nour real-world data we could not verify any of the demand distribution\nassumptions suggested in the literature. Our approach cannot estimate the\ndemand for sizes directly.

The macroscopic eigenvalue distribution of such matrices is governed by\nthe so called Single Ring Theorem, due to Guionnet, Krishnapur and Zeitouni.

Then, we study the fluctuations of the\noutliers of $A$ around the eigenvalues of $P$ and prove that they are\ndistributed as the eigenvalues of some finite dimensional random matrices.

More surprising facts are\nthat outliers can here have very various rates of convergence to their limits\n(depending on the Jordan Canonical Form of $P$) and that some correlations can\nappear between outliers at a macroscopic distance from each other (a fact\nalready noticed by Knowles and Yin in the Hermitian case, but only in the case\nof non Gaussian models, whereas spiked Gaussian matrices belong to our model\nand can have such correlated outliers).

However, the HH model was\nproposed in 1952 when the real structure of the ion channel was unknown. It is\nnow common knowledge that in many ion-channel proteins the flow of ions through\nthe pore is governed by a gate, comprising a so-called selectivity filter\ninside the ion channel, which can be controlled by electrical interactions. The\nselectivity filter is believed to be responsible for the selection and fast\nconduction of particular ions across the membrane of an excitable cell. Other\n(generally larger) parts of the molecule such as the pore-domain gate control\nthe access of ions to the channel protein. In fact, two types of gates are\nconsidered here for ion channels: the external gate, which is the voltage\nsensitive gate, and the internal gate which is the selectivity filter gate\n(SFG). Some quantum effects are to expected in the SFG due to its small\ndimensions, which may play an important role in the operation of an ion\nchannel.

To establish an efficient framework to\ncompute sum rules of the response that is adaptable to the optimization of the\nnuclear EDF and large-scale surveys of collective strength, we have developed a\nnew technique within the complex-energy FAM based on the QRPA.

The first game is formulated to design the optimal (in maxmin\nsense) scanning algorithm, while the second one allows one to find the optimal\nvalues of the parameters for the algorithm depending on parameters of the\nnetwork. These games provide solutions for two dilemmas that the rivals face.\nThe Invader's dilemma consists of the following: the more bandwidth the Invader\nattempts to use leads to a larger payoff if he is not detected, but at the same\ntime also increases the probability of being detected and thus fined.\nSimilarly, the Scanner faces a dilemma: the wider the bandwidth scanned, the\nhigher the probability of detecting the Invader, but at the expense of\nincreasing the cost of building the scanning system. The equilibrium strategies\nare found explicitly and reveal interesting properties. In particular, we have\nfound a discontinuous dependence of the equilibrium strategies on the network\nparameters, fine and the type of the Invader's award. This discontinuity of the\nfine means that the network provider has to take into account a human/social\nfactor since some threshold values of fine could be very sensible for the\nInvader, while in other situations simply increasing the fine has minimal\ndeterrence impact.

The reconstructed dust emission is found to be non-uniform, but composed\nof multiple regions that are heated by both diffuse and strongly clumped\nstar-formation. The highest surface brightness region is a ~1.9*0.7 kpc\ndisk-like structure, whose small extent is consistent with a potential\nsize-bias in gravitationally lensed starbursts. Although surrounded by extended\nstar formation, with a density of 20-30+/-10 M_sol/yr/kpc^2, the disk contains\nthree compact regions with densities that peak between 120-190+/-20\nM_sol/yr/kpc^2. Such star-formation rate densities are below what is expected\nfor Eddington-limited star-formation by a radiation pressure supported\nstarburst. There is also a tentative variation in the spectral slope of the\ndifferent star-forming regions, which is likely due to a change in the dust\ntemperature and/or opacity across the source.\n","Comment: MNRAS accepted 2015 April 15"]}]

For the RL NLS1\nshowing bluer colours, instead, we cannot exclude the presence of a\nstar-forming host galaxy although, on average, we expect a lower star-formation\nrate. Studying the radio (1.4GHz) to mid-IR (22micron) flux ratios of the RL\nNLS1 in the sample we found that in ~10 objects the star-forming activity could\nrepresent the most important component also at radio frequencies, in addition\n(or in alternative) to the relativistic jet.

Susko et\nal. (2004) reported some strikingly broad results about the forms of\ninconsistency in tree estimation that can arise if corrected distances are not\nproportional to the true distances. They showed that if the corrected distance\nis a concave function of the true distance, then inconsistency due to long\nbranch attraction will occur. If these functions are convex, then two \"long\nbranch repulsion\" trees will be preferred over the true tree -- though these\ntwo incorrect trees are expected to be tied as the preferred true. Here we\nextend their results, and demonstrate the existence of a tree shape (which we\nrefer to as a \"twisted Farris-zone\" tree) for which a single incorrect tree\ntopology will be guaranteed to be preferred if the corrected distance function\nis convex. We also report that the standard practice of treating gaps in\nsequence alignments as missing data is sufficient to produce non-linear\ncorrected distance functions if the substitution process is not independent of\nthe insertion/deletion process. Taken together, these results imply\ninconsistent tree inference under mild conditions. For example, if some\npositions in a sequence are constrained to be free of substitutions and\ninsertion/deletion events while the remaining sites evolve with independent\nsubstitutions and insertion/deletion events, then the distances obtained by\ntreating gaps as missing data can support an incorrect tree topology even given\nan unlimited amount of data.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 3 figures"]}]

A new dynamic stochastic state (DS-state) is then defined to\ncharacterize the goal set of a dialog state at different stages of the dialog\nprocess. Furthermore, an entropy minimization dialog management(EMDM) strategy\nis also proposed to combine with the DS-states to facilitate a robust and\nefficient solution in reaching a user's goals. A Song-On-Demand task, with a\ntotal of 38117 songs and 12 attributes corresponding to each song, is used to\ntest the performance of the proposed approach. In an ideal simulation, assuming\nno errors, the EMDM strategy is the most efficient goal-seeking method among\nall tested approaches, returning the correct song within 3.3 dialog turns on\naverage. Furthermore, in a practical scenario, with top five candidates to\nhandle the unavoidable automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language\nunderstanding (NLU) errors, the results show that only 61.7\\% of the dialog\ngoals can be successfully obtained in 6.23 dialog turns on average when random\nquestions are asked by the system, whereas if the proposed DS-states are\nupdated with the top 5 candidates from the SLU output using the proposed EMDM\nstrategy executed at every DS-state, then a 86.7\\% dialog success rate can be\naccomplished effectively within 5.17 dialog turns on average. We also\ndemonstrate that entropy-based DM strategies are more efficient than\nnon-entropy based DM.
