Here (Part I), we\npresent a symmetry-based approach which derives analytic expressions governing\nthe mean velocity profile (MVP) from an innovative Lie-group analysis. The new\napproach begins by identifying a set of order functions (e.g. stress length,\nshear-induced eddy length), in analogy with the order parameter in Landau's\nmean-field theory, which aims at capturing symmetry aspects of the fluctuations\n(e.g. Reynolds stress, dissipation). The order functions are assumed to satisfy\na dilation group invariance - representing the effects of the wall on\nfluctuations - which allows us to postulate three new kinds of invariant\nsolutions of the mean momentum equation (MME), focusing on group invariants of\nthe order functions (rather than those of the mean velocity as done in previous\nstudies). The first - a power law solution - gives functional forms for the\nviscous sublayer, the buffer layer, the log-layer, and a newly identified\ncentral `core' (for channel and pipe, but non-existent for TBL). The second - a\ndefect power law of form $1-r^{m}$ ($r$ being the distance from the center\nline) - describes the `bulk zone' (the region of balance between production and\ndissipation). The third - a relation between the group invariants of the stress\nlength function and its first derivative - describes scaling transition between\nadjacent layers. A combination of these three expressions yields a multi-layer\nformula covering the entire flow domain, identifying three important\nparameters: scaling exponent, layer thickness, and transition sharpness. All\nthree kinds of invariant solutions are validated, individually and in\ncombination, by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS).\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The\npolarization fraction ($p$) of the dust emission decreases by $(21\\pm6)$ % from\n353 to 70 GHz.

Moreover the paper considers one of the most\nimportant examples of self-predicative universals in pure mathematics, namely\nadjoint functors or adjunctions. It gives a parsing of adjunctions into two\nhalves (left and right semi-adjunctions) using the heterodox notion of\nheteromorphisms, and then shows that the parts can be recombined in a new way\nto define the cognate-to-adjoints notion of a brain functor that provides an\nabstract conceptual model of a brain. 4.

In\nthe buckled shape, both approaches exhibit a locally compressive hoop stress in\na region where experiments and simulations show the development of polygonal\nwrinkles, along the dimple edge.

The RRHs and\nthe CP are equipped with renewable energy harvesters and share their energies\nvia a lossy micropower grid for improving the efficiency in conveying\ninformation and green energy to mobile receivers via radio frequency (RF)\nsignals. The considered resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a\nmixed non-convex and combinatorial optimization problem taking into account the\nlimited backhaul capacity and the quality of service requirements for\nsimultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We aim at\nminimizing the total network transmit power when only imperfect channel state\ninformation of the wireless energy harvesting receivers, which have to be\npowered by the wireless network, is available at the CP. In light of the\nintractability of the problem, we reformulate it as an optimization problem\nwith binary selection, which facilitates the design of an iterative resource\nallocation algorithm to solve the problem optimally using the generalized\nBender's decomposition (GBD). Furthermore, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed\nto strike a balance between computational complexity and system performance.\nSimulation results illustrate that the proposed GBD based algorithm obtains the\nglobal optimal solution and the suboptimal algorithm achieves a\nclose-to-optimal performance. Besides, the distributed antenna network for\nSWIPT with renewable energy sharing is shown to require a lower transmit power\ncompared to a traditional system with multiple co-located antennas.\n","Comment: accepted for publication, IEEE Transactions on Wireless\n  Communications, May 10, 2015"]}]

The objective then in our\nproblem is to find a partition, so that each agent is guaranteed her maximin\nshare. In settings with indivisible goods, such allocations are not guaranteed\nto exist, so we resort to approximation algorithms. Our main result is a\n$2/3$-approximation, that runs in polynomial time for any number of agents.\nThis improves upon the algorithm of Procaccia and Wang, which also produces a\n$2/3$-approximation but runs in polynomial time only for a constant number of\nagents. To achieve this, we redesign certain parts of their algorithm.\nFurthermore, motivated by the apparent difficulty, both theoretically and\nexperimentally, in finding lower bounds on the existence of approximate\nsolutions, we undertake a probabilistic analysis. We prove that in randomly\ngenerated instances, with high probability there exists a maximin share\nallocation.

In turn this provides quantitative insights into the\nmechanisms that lead to the non-monotonic behaviour of the mean first passage\ntime.

Given the sheer size of such social networks, many\nexisting studies resort to sampling techniques that draw random nodes from an\nonline social network through its restrictive web/API interface. Almost all of\nthem use the exact same underlying technique of random walk - a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo based method which iteratively transits from one node to its random\nneighbor.\n  Random walk fits naturally with this problem because, for most online social\nnetworks, the only query we can issue through the interface is to retrieve the\nneighbors of a given node (i.e., no access to the full graph topology). A\nproblem with random walks, however, is the \"burn-in\" period which requires a\nlarge number of transitions/queries before the sampling distribution converges\nto a stationary value that enables the drawing of samples in a statistically\nvalid manner.\n  In this paper, we consider a novel problem of speeding up the fundamental\ndesign of random walks (i.e., reducing the number of queries it requires)\nwithout changing the stationary distribution it achieves - thereby enabling a\nmore efficient \"drop-in\" replacement for existing sampling-based analytics\ntechniques over online social networks. Our main idea is to leverage the\nhistory of random walks to construct a higher-ordered Markov chain. We develop\ntwo algorithms, Circulated Neighbors and Groupby Neighbors Random Walk (CNRW\nand GNRW) and prove that, no matter what the social network topology is, CNRW\nand GNRW offer better efficiency than baseline random walks while achieving the\nsame stationary distribution.

A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet.

A fundamental question is how one can optimally\nresolve this trade-off. A big challenge is the fact that an adversary can also\nutilize the knowledge of such usability vs. security trade-offs to strengthen\nits attack. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for analyzing\nthe optimal trade-offs in the face of strategic adversaries. We consider two\ntypes of adversaries: those limited in their number of tries, and those that\nare ruled by the cost of making individual guesses. For each type, we derive\nthe mutually-optimal decisions as Nash Equilibria, the strategically\npessimistic decisions as maximin, and optimal commitments as Strong Stackelberg\nEquilibria of the game. We establish that when the adversaries are faced with a\ncapped number of guesses, the user's optimal trade-off is a uniform\nrandomization over a subset of the secret domain. On the other hand, when the\nattacker strategy is ruled by the cost of making individual guesses, Nash\nEquilibria may completely fail to provide the user with any level of security,\nsignifying the crucial role of credible commitment for such cases.

In this follow-up paper we answer some of the questions\nthat were raised in the introductory study. In addition, we study spicules\noff-limb in C II 1330 {\\AA} for the first time. We find that Ca II H spicules\nare more similar to Mg II 2796 {\\AA} spicules than initially reported. For a\nsample of 54 spicules, we find that 44% of Si IV 1400 {\\AA} spicules are\nbrighter toward the top; 56% of the spicules show an increase in Si IV emission\nwhen the Ca II H component fades. We find several examples of spicules that\nfade from passbands other than Ca II H, and we observe that if a spicule fades\nfrom a passband, it also generally fades from the passbands with lower\nformation temperatures. We discuss what these new, multi-spectral results mean\nfor the classification of type I and II spicules.\n","Comment: Accepted in APJ"]}]

Along the magnetic field, Viriato allows for either a\nsecond-order accurate MacCormack method or, for higher accuracy, a\nspectral-like scheme composed of the combination of a total variation\ndiminishing (TVD) third order Runge-Kutta method for the time derivative with a\n7th order upwind scheme for the fluxes.

Our algorithms\nare realized in a program \"KERTAP\" in two versions: MATLAB and Python. The key\ningredients of KERTAP are: a graphic user interface, a {\\it backward}\nray-tracing algorithm, a polarization propagator dealing with gravitational\nFaraday rotation, and algorithms computing observables such as flux\nmagnification and polarization angles. Our algorithms can be easily realized in\nother programming languages such as FORTRAN, C, and C++. The MATLAB version of\nKERTAP is parallelized using the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox and the\nDistributed Computing Server. The Python code was sped up using Cython and\nsupports full implementation of MPI using 'mpi4py' package. As an example, we\ninvestigate the inclination angle dependence of the observed polarization and\nthe strong lensing magnification of AGN X-ray emission. We conclude that it is\npossible to perform complex numerical-relativity-related computations using\ninterpreted languages such as MATLAB and Python.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning, which may result in\nexpensive query evaluation, while others apply heuristics aiming at minimizing\ninter-node communication during query evaluation. This requires an expensive\ndata preprocessing phase, leading to high startup costs for very large RDF\nknowledge bases. Apriori knowledge of the query workload has also been used to\ncreate partitions, which however are static and do not adapt to workload\nchanges; hence, inter-node communication cannot be consistently avoided for\nqueries that are not favored by the initial data partitioning.\n  In this paper, we propose AdHash, a distributed RDF system, which addresses\nthe shortcomings of previous work. First, AdHash applies lightweight\npartitioning on the initial data, that distributes triples by hashing on their\nsubjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time, the\nlocality-aware query optimizer of AdHash takes full advantage of the\npartitioning to (i)support the fully parallel processing of join patterns on\nsubjects and (ii) minimize data communication for general queries by applying\nhash distribution of intermediate results instead of broadcasting, wherever\npossible. Second, AdHash monitors the data access patterns and dynamically\nredistributes and replicates the instances of the most frequent ones among\nworkers. As a result, the communication cost for future queries is drastically\nreduced or even eliminated. To control replication, AdHash implements an\neviction policy for the redistributed patterns. Our experiments with synthetic\nand real data verify that AdHash (i) starts faster than all existing systems,\n(ii) processes thousands of queries before other systems become online, and\n(iii) gracefully adapts to the query load, being able to evaluate queries on\nbillion-scale RDF data in sub-seconds.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

Basic problems in this context are range\ncharacterization--where systems of PDE appear--and inversion formulae. As we\npointed out in a series of joint papers with Pierre Schapira, the language of\nsheaves and D-modules provides both a natural framework and powerful tools for\nthe study of such problems. In particular, it provides a general adjunction\nformula which is a sort of archetypical theorem in integral geometry. Focusing\non range characterization, we illustrate this approach with a discussion of the\nRadon transform, in some of its manifold manifestations.\n","Comment: 21 pages, LaTeX"]}]
