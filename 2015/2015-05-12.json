Here (Part I), we\npresent a symmetry-based approach which derives analytic expressions governing\nthe mean velocity profile (MVP) from an innovative Lie-group analysis. The new\napproach begins by identifying a set of order functions (e.g. stress length,\nshear-induced eddy length), in analogy with the order parameter in Landau's\nmean-field theory, which aims at capturing symmetry aspects of the fluctuations\n(e.g. Reynolds stress, dissipation). The order functions are assumed to satisfy\na dilation group invariance - representing the effects of the wall on\nfluctuations - which allows us to postulate three new kinds of invariant\nsolutions of the mean momentum equation (MME), focusing on group invariants of\nthe order functions (rather than those of the mean velocity as done in previous\nstudies). The first - a power law solution - gives functional forms for the\nviscous sublayer, the buffer layer, the log-layer, and a newly identified\ncentral `core' (for channel and pipe, but non-existent for TBL). The second - a\ndefect power law of form $1-r^{m}$ ($r$ being the distance from the center\nline) - describes the `bulk zone' (the region of balance between production and\ndissipation). The third - a relation between the group invariants of the stress\nlength function and its first derivative - describes scaling transition between\nadjacent layers. A combination of these three expressions yields a multi-layer\nformula covering the entire flow domain, identifying three important\nparameters: scaling exponent, layer thickness, and transition sharpness. All\nthree kinds of invariant solutions are validated, individually and in\ncombination, by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS).\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Moreover the paper considers one of the most\nimportant examples of self-predicative universals in pure mathematics, namely\nadjoint functors or adjunctions. It gives a parsing of adjunctions into two\nhalves (left and right semi-adjunctions) using the heterodox notion of\nheteromorphisms, and then shows that the parts can be recombined in a new way\nto define the cognate-to-adjoints notion of a brain functor that provides an\nabstract conceptual model of a brain. 4.

In\nthe buckled shape, both approaches exhibit a locally compressive hoop stress in\na region where experiments and simulations show the development of polygonal\nwrinkles, along the dimple edge.

We aim at\nminimizing the total network transmit power when only imperfect channel state\ninformation of the wireless energy harvesting receivers, which have to be\npowered by the wireless network, is available at the CP. In light of the\nintractability of the problem, we reformulate it as an optimization problem\nwith binary selection, which facilitates the design of an iterative resource\nallocation algorithm to solve the problem optimally using the generalized\nBender's decomposition (GBD). Furthermore, a suboptimal algorithm is proposed\nto strike a balance between computational complexity and system performance.\nSimulation results illustrate that the proposed GBD based algorithm obtains the\nglobal optimal solution and the suboptimal algorithm achieves a\nclose-to-optimal performance. Besides, the distributed antenna network for\nSWIPT with renewable energy sharing is shown to require a lower transmit power\ncompared to a traditional system with multiple co-located antennas.\n","Comment: accepted for publication, IEEE Transactions on Wireless\n  Communications, May 10, 2015"]}]

The waveform is accurate to 1.5 post-Newtonian order\n[$O((v/c)^3)$] beyond the leading-order tensor gravitational waves (the\n\"Newtonian quadrupole\"). To solve the scalar-tensor field equations, we adapt\nthe direct integration of the relaxed Einstein equations formalism developed by\nWill, Wiseman, and Pati. The internal gravity of the compact objects is treated\nwith an approach developed by Eardley. We find that the scalar waves are\ndescribed by the same small set of parameters which describes the equations of\nmotion and tensor waves. For black hole--black hole binaries, the scalar\nwaveform vanishes, as expected from previous results which show that these\nsystems in scalar-tensor theory are indistinguishable from their general\nrelativistic counterparts. For black hole--neutron star binaries, the scalar\nwaveform simplifies considerably from the generic case, essentially depending\non only a single parameter up to first post-Newtonian order.

Given the sheer size of such social networks, many\nexisting studies resort to sampling techniques that draw random nodes from an\nonline social network through its restrictive web/API interface. Almost all of\nthem use the exact same underlying technique of random walk - a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo based method which iteratively transits from one node to its random\nneighbor.\n  Random walk fits naturally with this problem because, for most online social\nnetworks, the only query we can issue through the interface is to retrieve the\nneighbors of a given node (i.e., no access to the full graph topology). A\nproblem with random walks, however, is the \"burn-in\" period which requires a\nlarge number of transitions/queries before the sampling distribution converges\nto a stationary value that enables the drawing of samples in a statistically\nvalid manner.\n  In this paper, we consider a novel problem of speeding up the fundamental\ndesign of random walks (i.e., reducing the number of queries it requires)\nwithout changing the stationary distribution it achieves - thereby enabling a\nmore efficient \"drop-in\" replacement for existing sampling-based analytics\ntechniques over online social networks. Our main idea is to leverage the\nhistory of random walks to construct a higher-ordered Markov chain. We develop\ntwo algorithms, Circulated Neighbors and Groupby Neighbors Random Walk (CNRW\nand GNRW) and prove that, no matter what the social network topology is, CNRW\nand GNRW offer better efficiency than baseline random walks while achieving the\nsame stationary distribution.

The light curve folded on the new period\nis qualitatively similar to that reported previously, having a spike at phase 0\nand broad sinusoidal modulation. The X-ray flux enhancement at phase 0 occurs\nmore regularly in time than was previously suggested. A spiky structure at this\nphase seems to be a persistent feature, although there is some variability.\nFurthermore, we find that the source flux clearly correlates with the spectral\nhardness throughout all orbital phases, and that the broadband X-ray spectra\nmeasured with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Swift are well fit with an unbroken\npower-law model. This spectrum suggests that the system may not be\naccretion-powered.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

The hydrodynamic escape rates of\nNeptune- and sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets are comparable to the\ndiffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen, and therefore the escape is heavily\naffected by diffusive separation between hydrogen and helium. A helium\natmosphere can thus be formed -- from a primordial hydrogen-helium atmosphere\n-- via atmospheric hydrodynamic escape from the planet. The helium atmosphere\nhas very different abundances of major carbon and oxygen species from those of\na hydrogen atmosphere, leading to distinctive transmission and thermal emission\nspectral features. In particular, the hypothesis of a helium-dominated\natmosphere can explain the thermal emission spectrum of GJ 436 b, a warm\nNeptune-sized exoplanet, while also consistent with the transmission spectrum.\nThis model atmosphere contains trace amounts of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen,\nwith the predominance of CO over CH4 as the main form of carbon.

Whether it is a password for user authentication or a secret key\nfor a cryptographic primitive, picking it requires the user to trade-off\nusability costs with resistance against an adversary: a simple password is\neasier to remember but is also easier to guess; likewise, a shorter\ncryptographic key may require fewer computational and storage resources but it\nis also easier to attack. A fundamental question is how one can optimally\nresolve this trade-off. A big challenge is the fact that an adversary can also\nutilize the knowledge of such usability vs. security trade-offs to strengthen\nits attack. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for analyzing\nthe optimal trade-offs in the face of strategic adversaries. We consider two\ntypes of adversaries: those limited in their number of tries, and those that\nare ruled by the cost of making individual guesses. For each type, we derive\nthe mutually-optimal decisions as Nash Equilibria, the strategically\npessimistic decisions as maximin, and optimal commitments as Strong Stackelberg\nEquilibria of the game. We establish that when the adversaries are faced with a\ncapped number of guesses, the user's optimal trade-off is a uniform\nrandomization over a subset of the secret domain. On the other hand, when the\nattacker strategy is ruled by the cost of making individual guesses, Nash\nEquilibria may completely fail to provide the user with any level of security,\nsignifying the crucial role of credible commitment for such cases.

The monotonicity of the period\nvariations and the morphology of the respective ETV diagrams are thoroughly\nexplored in both the direct impact and the accretion disk mode of mass\ntransfer, accompanied by different types of mass and angular momentum losses\n(through a hot-spot emission from the gainer and via the L2/L3 points). Mass\ntransfer rates comparable to or greater than 10^{-8} M_sun/yr are measurable\nfor typical noise levels of the ETV diagrams, regardless of whether the process\nis conservative. However, the presence of a transient disk around the more\nmassive component defines a critical mass ratio q_cr ~ 0.83 above which the\nperiod turns out to decrease when still in the conservative regime, rendering\nthe measurability of the anticipated variations a much more complicated task.\nThe effects of gravitational radiation proved to be rather undetectable, except\nfor systems with physical characteristics that only refer to cataclysmic\nvariables.

This is consistent with the picture of a patchy wind. The\nmost significant variation occurred in September 2013 when the source\nbrightened for two weeks. A higher and steeper intrinsic continuum and a lower\nobscurer covering fraction are both required to explain the spectral shape\nduring the flare. We suggest that a geometrical change of the soft X-ray source\nbehind the obscurer cause the observed drop in the covering fraction. Due to\nthe higher soft X-ray continuum level the September 2013 Chandra spectrum is\nthe only X ray spectrum of the campaign where individual features of the warm\nabsorber could be detected.

Viriato uses operator splitting (Strang or Godunov) to\nseparate the dynamics parallel and perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field\n(assumed strong). Along the magnetic field, Viriato allows for either a\nsecond-order accurate MacCormack method or, for higher accuracy, a\nspectral-like scheme composed of the combination of a total variation\ndiminishing (TVD) third order Runge-Kutta method for the time derivative with a\n7th order upwind scheme for the fluxes.

Some systems perform cheap hash partitioning, which may result in\nexpensive query evaluation, while others apply heuristics aiming at minimizing\ninter-node communication during query evaluation. This requires an expensive\ndata preprocessing phase, leading to high startup costs for very large RDF\nknowledge bases. Apriori knowledge of the query workload has also been used to\ncreate partitions, which however are static and do not adapt to workload\nchanges; hence, inter-node communication cannot be consistently avoided for\nqueries that are not favored by the initial data partitioning.\n  In this paper, we propose AdHash, a distributed RDF system, which addresses\nthe shortcomings of previous work. First, AdHash applies lightweight\npartitioning on the initial data, that distributes triples by hashing on their\nsubjects; this renders its startup overhead low. At the same time, the\nlocality-aware query optimizer of AdHash takes full advantage of the\npartitioning to (i)support the fully parallel processing of join patterns on\nsubjects and (ii) minimize data communication for general queries by applying\nhash distribution of intermediate results instead of broadcasting, wherever\npossible. Second, AdHash monitors the data access patterns and dynamically\nredistributes and replicates the instances of the most frequent ones among\nworkers. As a result, the communication cost for future queries is drastically\nreduced or even eliminated. To control replication, AdHash implements an\neviction policy for the redistributed patterns. Our experiments with synthetic\nand real data verify that AdHash (i) starts faster than all existing systems,\n(ii) processes thousands of queries before other systems become online, and\n(iii) gracefully adapts to the query load, being able to evaluate queries on\nbillion-scale RDF data in sub-seconds.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]
