The potential generates stress in the magnetostrictive layer and rotates\nits magnetization by a large angle to carry out Bennett clocking. This method\nof clocking is far more energy-efficient than using spin transfer torque. In\norder to assess if such a clocking scheme can be also reasonably fast, we have\nstudied the magnetization dynamics of a multiferroic logic array with nearest\nneighbor dipole coupling using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. We\nfind that switching delays of ~ 3 ns (clock rates of 0.33 GHz) can be achieved\nwith proper design provided we clock non-adiabatically and dissipate ~48,000 kT\n(at room temperature) of energy per clock cycle per bit flip in the clocking\ncircuit.

Motivated by these observations, we study\nthe non-radial oscillation modes of giant planets containing a solid core. Our\ncalculations include the elastic response of the core and consider a wide range\nof possible values of the core shear modulus. While the elasticity of the core\nonly slightly changes the frequencies of acoustic modes, which reside mostly in\nthe fluid envelope, it adds two new classes of shear modes that are largely\nconfined to the core. We also calculate the effects of the Coriolis force on\nthe planetary oscillation modes. In addition to changing the mode frequencies,\nthe Coriolis force can cause the shear modes to mix with the f-modes. Such\nmixing occurs when the frequencies of the shear mode and the f-mode are close\nto each other, and results in \"mixed modes\" with similar properties that are\nslightly split in frequency. We discuss our results in light of the recent work\nby Hedman & Nicholson (2013), which revealed the presence of density waves in\nSaturn's C-ring that appear to be excited by the gravitational perturbations\nassociated with the f-mode oscillations within Saturn. We find that the fine\nsplitting in wave frequencies observed in the rings can in principle be\nexplained by the rotation-induced mixing between core shear modes and f-modes,\npossibly indicating the presence of a solid core within Saturn. However, in our\ncurrent calculations, which assume rigid-body rotation and include only\nfirst-order rotational effects, significant fine-tuning in the planetary model\nparameters is needed in order to achieve these mode mixings and to explain the\nobserved fine frequency splitting.

We investigate the\nrole of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low\nmass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively\nexcited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential\nrotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into\nsub-giants, however, low frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and\ncannot propagate below the hydrogen burning shell, allowing the spin of the\ncore to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the\nbase of the sub-giant branch when stars have surface temperatures of roughly\n5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region,\nimplying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep\ncore near the hydrogen burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region\nmay also prevent the core from accreting high-angular momentum material and\nslow the rate of core spin-up.

This scenario could explain several\nfeatures of FRBs: their short time scales, large energies, locally produced\nscattering tails, and high event rates. We predict that FRBs are localized to\ngalactic centers, and that our own galactic center harbors a large population\nof NS-mass ($M\\sim1.4 M_\\odot$) black holes.

I\nanalyze the eight transmission spectra using the newly-developed,\nself-consistent atmospheric retrieval framework, SCARLET. Unlike previous\nmethods, SCARLET combines the physical and chemical consistency of complex\natmospheric models with the statistical treatment of observational\nuncertainties known from atmospheric retrieval techniques. I find that all\neight hot Jupiters consistently require carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) below\n0.9. The finding of C/O<0.9 is highly robust for HD209458b, WASP-12b, WASP-19b,\nHAT-P-1b, and XO-1b.

I further show that the water abundances on all eight hot Jupiters\nare consistent with solar composition. The relatively small depth of the\ndetected water absorption features is due to the presence of clouds, not due to\na low water abundance as previously suggested for HD209458b.

However, the recent suggestion that a ring system\nmight exist (or have existed) about Rhea, a moon whose shape includes a strong\nprolate component pointed toward Saturn, raises the question of whether rings\naround a triaxial primary can be stable. We study the role of prolateness in\nthe behavior of rings around Rhea and extend our results to similar problems\nsuch as possible rings around exoplanets. Using a Hamiltonian approach, we\npoint out that the dynamical behavior of ring particles is governed by three\ndifferent time scales: the orbital period of the particles, the rotation period\nof the primary, and the precession period of the particles' orbital plane. In\nthe case of Rhea, two of these are well separated from the third, allowing us\nto average the Hamiltonian twice. To study the case of slow rotation of the\nprimary, we also carry out numerical simulations of a thin disk of particles\nundergoing secular effects and damping. For Rhea, the averaging reduces the\nHamiltonian to an oblate potential, under which rings would be stable only in\nthe equatorial plane. This is not the case for Iapetus; rather, it is the lack\nof a prolate component to its shape that allows Iapetus to host rings.\nPlausible exoplanets should mostly be in the same regime as Rhea, though other\noutcomes are possible.

The temporal graph exploration problem TEXP is the problem of computing a\nforemost exploration schedule for a temporal graph, i.e., a temporal walk that\nstarts at a given start node, visits all nodes of the graph, and has the\nsmallest arrival time. We consider only temporal graphs that are connected at\neach step. For such temporal graphs with $n$ nodes, we show that it is NP-hard\nto approximate TEXP with ratio $O(n^{1-\\epsilon})$ for any $\\epsilon>0$. We\nalso provide an explicit construction of temporal graphs that require\n$\\Theta(n^2)$ steps to be explored. We then consider TEXP under the assumption\nthat the underlying graph (i.e. the graph that contains all edges that are\npresent in the temporal graph in at least one step) belongs to a specific class\nof graphs. Among other results, we show that temporal graphs can be explored in\n$O(n^{1.5} k^2 \\log n)$ steps if the underlying graph has treewidth $k$ and in\n$O(n \\log^3 n)$ steps if the underlying graph is a $2\\times n$ grid.
