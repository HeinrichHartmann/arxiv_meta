While these methods do not provide an unambiguous\ndetection of exorings, we show that the large amplitude of these effects\ncombined with their relatively simple analytic description, makes them highly\nsuited to large-scale surveys to identify candidate ringed planets worthy of\nmore detailed investigation.

The\nrippling morphology of graphene, discovered also in other 2D materials, has a\nprofound impact on its electronic, mechanical and chemical properties.\nActually, before the discovery of graphene, rippling phenomena are widely\nobserved: for example, the roughing transition of crystalline interface, the\nrippled phase in biomembrane, and crumpling of flexible sheet polymers modeled\nby tethered surfaces. The fascinating truth that ripples exist in so many\ndifferent membrane-like materials implies possible existence of a universal\nphysical mechanism which was unclear. We consider the ripples in suspended\ngraphene as two parts, characterizing the first part by the spontaneous\ncurvature k which stabilizes the possible soft ZA modes, and the second part by\nthe thermal curvature kt which is caused directly by height fluctuation. By\nchoosing k as the order parameter of the system, we establish the Landau theory\nmodified by thermal fluctuation for wrinkling transition of large sized\ngraphene. We find that as temperature rises from 0K, a second order phase\ntransition occurs at a size dependent critical temperature Tc, which\ncorresponds to a change of equilibrium configuration from a flat state to a\nrippling state. Interestingly, the order parameter is stablized as temperature\nincreases, and the phase transition is associated with a jump of equilibrium\nbond length as well as a vanishing intrinsic bending rigidity. The results\nobtained suggest that the interplay between the rippling morphology and the\nelementary excitations is vital for understanding the behavior of 2D materials.\nThe concepts and theory developed here is of general significance at least for\ntethered membranes.\n","Comment: 26 pages (18 main text, 8 supplementary information), 4 figures(3\n  main text, 1 supplementary information)"]}]

In particular, the exponential forms of the vector rotations\nenables us to take advantage of the addition or subtraction of exponential\narguments of two rotated vectors in the derivation of the ray tracing\ninvariants in cylindrical and spherical coordinates. We showed that the light\nrays inside the optical fiber trace a polygonal helical path characterized by\nthree invariants that relate successive reflections inside the fiber: the ray\npath distance, the difference in axial distances, and the difference in the\nazimuthal angles. We also rederived the known generalized formula for the\nnumerical aperture for skew rays, which simplifies to the standard form for\nmeridional rays.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures.

By adopting a two-layer\nencoding scheme, a rate-adaptive channel code is applied in each fading block\nto enable successful decoding by a chosen subset of users (which varies over\ndifferent blocks) and an application layer erasure code is employed across\nmultiple blocks to ensure that every user is able to recover the message after\ndecoding successfully in a sufficient number of blocks. The transmit signal and\ncode-rate in each block determine opportunistically the subset of users that\nare able to successfully decode and can be chosen to maximize the long-term\nmulticast efficiency. The employment of OUS not only helps avoid\nrate-limitations caused by the user with the worst channel, but also helps\ncoordinate interference among different cells and multicast groups. In this\nwork, efficient algorithms are proposed for the design of the transmit\ncovariance matrices, the physical layer code-rates, and the target user subsets\nin each block. In the single group scenario, the system parameters are\ndetermined by maximizing the group-rate, defined as the physical layer\ncode-rate times the fraction of users that can successfully decode in each\nblock. In the multi-group scenario, the system parameters are determined by\nconsidering a group-rate balancing optimization problem, which is solved by a\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) approach. To further reduce the feedback\noverhead, we also consider the case where only part of the users feed back\ntheir channel vectors in each block and propose a design based on the balancing\nof the expected group-rates.

The current experiments combine two different techniques, an array\nof surface detectors and fluorescence telescopes. The latter allow an almost\ncalorimetric measurement of the primary energy. Thus, hadron-initiated showers\ndetected by both type of detectors are used to calibrate the energy estimator\nfrom the surface array (usually the interpolated signal at a certain distance\nfrom the shower core S(r0)) with the primary energy. On the other hand, this\ncalibration is not feasible when searching for photon primaries since no high\nenergy photon has been unambiguously detected so far.

In\nparticular, we observe an analogy between a spectrum of physical theories (from\nclassical to quantum) and a spectrum of convex optimization problems (from\nlinear programming to semidefinite programming, through second-order cone\nprogramming). In this analogy, classical systems correspond to linear\nprogramming problems and the level of quantum features in the system is\ncorrelated to the level of sophistication of the semidefinite programming\nmodels on the optimization side.\n  Concerning security analysis, we use the classical point games to prove that\nevery classical protocol of this type allows exactly one of the parties to\nentirely determine the coin-flip.
