Considering the $x_i$ as\njobs to be performed, an integer assignment satisfying $S$ schedules the jobs\nsubject to the constraints of the atomic formulas. The scheduling counting\nfunction counts the number of solutions to $S$. We prove that this counting\nfunction is a polynomial in the number of time slots allowed. Scheduling\npolynomials include the chromatic polynomial of a graph, the zeta polynomial of\na lattice, the Billera-Jia-Reiner polynomial of a matroid.\n  To any scheduling problem, we associate not only a counting function for\nsolutions, but also a quasisymmetric function and a quasisymmetric function in\nnon-commuting variables. These scheduling functions include the chromatic\nsymmetric functions of Sagan, Gebhard, and Stanley, and a close variant of\nEhrenborg's quasisymmetric function for posets.\n  Geometrically, we consider the space of all solutions to a given scheduling\nproblem. We extend a result of Steingr\\'immson by proving that the $h$-vector\nof the space of solutions is given by a shift of the scheduling polynomial.\nFurthermore, under certain niceness conditions on the defining boolean\nfunction, we prove partitionability of the space of solutions and positivity of\nfundamental expansions of the scheduling quasisymmetric functions and of the\n$h$-vector of the scheduling polynomial.\n","Comment: Final version, substantially shortened, 18 pages"]}]

Hence they may serve as a\ntheoretical (as well as an experimental) tool to detect the spatial properties\nof the entanglement entropy of a subsystem. In the ground state of quantum\nmany-body systems, its scaling is typically linear in the boundary of the\nsubsystem (area law). Here we propose a microscopic insight into the spatial\nstructure of entanglement and fluctuations using the concept of \\emph{contour},\nrecently introduced to decompose the bipartite entanglement entropy of lattice\nfree fermions between two extended regions $A$ and $B$ into contributions from\nsingle sites in $A$. We generalize the notion of contour to the entanglement of\nany quadratic (bosonic or fermionic) lattice Hamiltonian, as well as to\nparticle-number fluctuations. The entanglement and fluctuations contours are\nfound to generally decay when moving away from the boundary between $A$ and\n$B$. We show that in the case of free fermions the decay of the entanglement\ncontour follows closely that of the fluctuation contour. In the case of\nBose-condensed interacting bosons, treated via the Bogoliubov and spin-wave\napproximations, such a link cannot be established -- fluctuation and\nentanglement contours are found to be radically different, as they lead to a\nlogarithmically violated area law for fluctuations, and to a strict area law of\nentanglement. Analyzing in depth the role of the zero-energy Goldstone mode of\nspin-wave theory, and of the corresponding lowest-energy mode in the\nentanglement spectrum, we unveil a subtle interplay between the special contour\nand energy scaling of the latter, and universal additive logarithmic\ncorrections to entanglement area law discussed extensively in the recent\nliterature.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 14 figures"]}]

Entropy measures the rate of information gain, or degree of\nregularity in a time series e.g. heartbeat. Ideally, entropy should be able to\nquantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as\ndetermine if the variation arises from a random process. Unfortunately current\nentropy measures mostly are unable to perform the latter differentiation. Thus,\na high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, whereas a low score\nindicates a high degree of regularity. This leads to the observation that\ncurrent entropy measures are equivalent to evaluating how random a series is,\nor conversely the degree of regularity in a time series. This raises the\npossibility that existing tests for randomness, such as the runs test or\npermutation test, may have similar utility in diagnosing certain conditions.\nThis paper compares various tests for randomness with existing entropy-based\nmeasurements such as sample entropy, permutation entropy and multi-scale\nentropy.
