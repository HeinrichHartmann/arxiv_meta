The free\nenergy divergence is due to the large degeneracy and continuity of the low\nenergy spectrum in the boundary theory at the deconfinement phase.

Consequently, the observation of bulk\nCDW order in YBCO was a significant development [5,6,7]. Hg1201 features\nparticularly high structural symmetry and recently has been demonstrated to\nexhibit Fermi-liquid charge transport in the relevant temperature-doping range\nof the phase diagram, whereas for YBCO and other cuprates this underlying\nproperty of the CuO$_2$ planes is partially or fully masked [8-10].

Furthermore, the\nsmaller CDW modulation wave vector observed for Hg1201 is consistent with the\nlarger electron pocket implied by both QO [4] and Hall-effect [14]\nmeasurements, which suggests that CDW correlations are indeed responsible for\nthe low-temperature QO phenomenon.\n"]}]

Complex irreversible\nprocesses arise from the coupling effects between simple irreversible\nprocesses. Each simple irreversible process is assiciated with an entropy or\nenergy density function. During complex irreversible processes with multiple\nfields present, this entropy or energy density function is assumed to be\ndependent on all independent field variables. Using the total entropy\nfunctionals, the TE effects and TDMT are analysed and important kinetic\ncoefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient and the heat of transport are\ndetermined with straightforward physical contents. Using the total energy\nfunctionals, the linear irreversible processes are analysed with the Onsager\napproach and the nonlinear irreversible processes with PFVA. It is found both\nthe Onsager's relations and the fluxes defined using PFVA guarantee the\nsatisfaction of the first law of thermodynamics during the process of\nconversion of energies. To analyze the diffusion process under the influence of\nelasticity, PFVA is also modified to incorporate the reversible evolution of\nelastic fields. It is shown energies are conserved via both the irreversible\ndiffusion process and the reversible evolution of the elastic fields. Finally,\nPFVA is generalized to study nonequilibrium thermodynamics using an extra\nkinetic contribution to the entropy density function. The analyses can be\nextended to a nonequilibrium thermodynamic system with multiple physical fields\npresent. Thus, it is believed PFVA has the potential of not only significantly\nadvancing our understanding of the thermodynamics of irreversible processes,\nbut also making thermodynamics as a discipline and the study of it truly\ndynamic.\n","Comment: A new section 6 added and references corrected"]}]

The\nmotivating example is the famous Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model of\nriffle-shuffling of a deck of cards, which arises in this manner from the\nshuffle algebra.\n  The primary reason for constructing Hopf-power Markov chains, or for\nrephrasing familiar chains through this lens, is that much information about\nthem comes simply from translating well-known facts on the underlying Hopf\nalgebra. For example, there is an explicit formula for the stationary\ndistribution (Theorem 4.5.1), and constructing quotient algebras show that\ncertain statistics on a Hopf-power Markov chain are themselves Markov chains\n(Theorem 4.7.1). Perhaps the pinnacle is Theorem 2.5.1, a collection of\nalgorithms for a full left and right eigenbasis in many common cases where the\nunderlying Hopf algebra is commutative or cocommutative. This arises from a\ncocktail of the Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem, the Cartier-Milnor-Moore\ntheorem, Reutenauer's structure theory of the free Lie algebra, and Patras's\nEulerian idempotent theory.\n  Since Hopf-power Markov chains can exhibit very different behaviour depending\non the structure of the underlying Hopf algebra and its distinguished basis,\none must restrict attention to certain styles of Hopf algebras in order to\nobtain stronger results. This thesis will focus respectively on a\nfree-commutative basis, which produces \"independent breaking\" chains, and a\ncofree basis; there will be both general statements and in-depth examples.\n","Comment: Revised version of PhD thesis. 178 pages, 6 figures.

This paper will discuss the\ngeothermal exploration based on regional scale surface temperature analysis\nwith Landsat image to have a more detail interpretation of the geological\nsetting and magneto-telluric or MT survey at prospect zones, which identified\nby the previous method, to have a more exact and in depth local scale\nstructural interpretation. Both methods are directed to pin point appropriate\nlocations for geothermal pilot hole drilling and testing.\n  We used four scenes of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper or ETM+ data to\nestimate the surface manifestation of a geothermal system. Temporal analysis of\nLand Surface Temperature or LST was applied and coupled with field temperature\nmeasurement at seven locations. By combining the TTM with NDVI threshold, the\nauthors can identify six zones with surface temperature anomaly. Among these\nsix zones, three zones were interpreted to have a relation with geothermal\nsystem and the other three zones were related to human activities. Then, MT\nsurvey was performed at the three geothermal prospects identified from previous\nremote sensing analysis, at the east flank of the volcano, to estimate the\ndetail subsurface structures. The MT survey successfully identified four buried\nnormal faults in the area, which positively are a part of the conduits in the\ngeothermal system east of Mount Ciremai. From MT analysis, the author also\nfound the locations of volcanic zone, bedrock zone, and the prospect zone. The\ncombination of Landsat analysis on regional scale and MT measurement on a more\ndetail scale has proven to be the reliable method to map geothermal prospect\narea.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 2 tables, 13 figures"]}]

The\nfinancial industry operates some of the largest datacenters in the world. With\nincreasing energy costs and the financial services sector growth, emerging\nfinancial analytics workloads may incur extremely high operational costs, to\nmeet their latency targets. Microservers have recently emerged as an\nalternative to high-end servers, promising scalable performance and low energy\nconsumption in datacenters via scale-out. Unfortunately, stark differences in\narchitectural features, form factor and design considerations make a fair\ncomparison between servers and microservers exceptionally challenging. In this\npaper we present a rigorous methodology and new metrics for fair comparison of\nserver and microserver platforms. We deploy our methodology and metrics to\ncompare a microserver with ARM cores against two servers with x86 cores,\nrunning the same real-time financial analytics workload. We define\nworkload-specific but platform-independent performance metrics for platform\ncomparison, targeting both datacenter operators and end users. Our methodology\nestablishes that a server based the Xeon Phi processor delivers the highest\nperformance and energy-efficiency. However, by scaling out energy-efficient\nmicroservers, we achieve competitive or better energy-efficiency than a\npower-equivalent server with two Sandy Bridge sockets despite the microserver's\nslower cores. Using a new iso-QoS (iso-Quality of Service) metric, we find that\nthe ARM microserver scales enough to meet market throughput demand, i.e. a 100%\nQoS in terms of timely option pricing, with as little as 55% of the energy\nconsumed by the Sandy Bridge server.\n"]}]

Low frequency (nanoHz) GWs are detectable through long-term\ntiming observations of the most stable pulsars. Radio observatories worldwide\nare currently carrying out observing programmes to detect GWs, with data sets\nbeing shared through the International Pulsar Timing Array project. One of the\nmost likely sources of low frequency GWs are supermassive black hole binaries\n(SMBHBs), detectable as a background due to a large number of binaries, or as\ncontinuous or burst emission from individual sources. No GW signal has yet been\ndetected, but stringent constraints are already being placed on galaxy\nevolution models. The SKA will bring this research to fruition.\n  In this chapter, we describe how timing observations using SKA1 will\ncontribute to detecting GWs, or can confirm a detection if a first signal\nalready has been identified when SKA1 commences observations. We describe how\nSKA observations will identify the source(s) of a GW signal, search for\nanisotropies in the background, improve models of galaxy evolution, test\ntheories of gravity, and characterise the early inspiral phase of a SMBHB\nsystem.\n  We describe the impact of the large number of millisecond pulsars to be\ndiscovered by the SKA; and the observing cadence, observation durations, and\ninstrumentation required to reach the necessary sensitivity. We describe the\nnoise processes that will influence the achievable precision with the SKA. We\nassume a long-term timing programme using the SKA1-MID array and consider the\nimplications of modifications to the current design. We describe the possible\nbenefits from observations using SKA1-LOW.

The rule-based\nmodelling language Kappa allows to unambiguously specify mechanistic details\nsuch as DNA binding sites, dimerisation of transcription factors, or\nco-operative interactions. However, such a detailed description comes with\ncomplexity and computationally costly execution. We propose a general method\nfor automatically transforming a rule-based program, by eliminating\nintermediate species and adjusting the rate constants accordingly. Our method\nconsists of searching for those interaction patterns known to be amenable to\nequilibrium approximations (e.g. Michaelis-Menten scheme). The reduced model is\nefficiently obtained by static inspection over the rule-set, and it represents\na particular theoretical limit of the original model. The Bhattacharyya\ndistance is proposed as a metric to estimate the reduction error for a given\nobservable.
