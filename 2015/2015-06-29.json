Solutions of this functional equation are called projective\nflows. A vector field of a rational flow is a pair of 2-homogenic rational\nfunctions.

In this paper we are interested in all\nnon-singular (satisfying the boundary condition) and unramified (without\nbranching points, i.e. single-valued functions in C^2\\{union of curves})\nprojective flows whose vector field is still rational.

As a result, vendors and operators are now\nlooking at using every tool at hand to improve network capacity. In this epic\ncampaign, three paradigms are noteworthy, i.e., network densification, the use\nof higher frequency bands and spectral efficiency enhancement techniques. This\npaper aims at bringing further common understanding and analysing the potential\ngains and limitations of these three paradigms, together with the impact of\nidle mode capabilities at the small cells as well as the user equipment density\nand distribution in outdoor scenarios. Special attention is paid to network\ndensification and its implications when transitioning to ultra-dense small cell\ndeployments. Simulation results show that network densification with an average\ninter site distance of 35 m can increase the cell- edge UE throughput by up to\n48x, while the use of the 10GHz band with a 500MHz bandwidth can increase the\nnetwork capacity up to 5x.

We apply a variety of initial\nperturbations to the interfaces between the two fluids in which the physical\nstandard deviation, wave number range, and the spectral slope of the\nperturbations are held constant, but the number of modes initially present is\nvaried. By thus decreasing the density of initial spectral modes of the\ninterface, we find that we can achieve as much as 25\\% less total mixing at\nlate times.

Scheduling parallel jobs is performed as a\nmeans to balance the load of a system in order to improve the performance of a\nparallel application. Parallel job scheduling is presented as a mapping between\ntwo graphs: one represents the dependency of jobs and the other represents the\ninterconnection among processors. The usual implementation of parallel job\nscheduling algorithms is via the master-slave paradigm. The master-slave\nparadigm has inherent communication bottleneck that reduces the performance of\nthe system when more processors are needed to process the jobs.

The difficulty lies in\nthe fact that, for a recent applications with high-dimensional covariates, the\nnumber of possible high-order interaction features would be extremely large.\nIdentifying statistically significant features from such a huge pool of\ncandidates would be highly challenging both in computational and statistical\nsenses. To work with this problem, we consider a two stage algorithm where we\nfirst select a set of high-order interaction features by marginal screening,\nand then make statistical inferences on the regression model fitted only with\nthe selected features. Such statistical inferences are called post-selection\ninference (PSI), and receiving an increasing attention in the literature. One\nof the seminal recent advancements in PSI literature is the works by Lee et al.\nwhere the authors presented an algorithmic framework for computing exact\nsampling distributions in PSI.

The goal of this paper is to overcome this difficulty by\nintroducing a novel efficient method for PSI.

This is, however, computationally\nchallenging task because the number of high-order interaction features to be\nconsidered would be extremely large unless the number of covariates is\nsufficiently small. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient algorithm for\nLASSO-based sparse learning of such high-order interaction models. Our basic\nstrategy for reducing the number of features is to employ the idea of recently\nproposed safe feature screening (SFS) rule. An SFS rule has a property that, if\na feature satisfies the rule, then the feature is guaranteed to be non-active\nin the LASSO solution, meaning that it can be safely screened-out prior to the\nLASSO training process. If a large number of features can be screened-out\nbefore training the LASSO, the computational cost and the memory requirment can\nbe dramatically reduced. However, applying such an SFS rule to each of the\nextremely large number of high-order interaction features would be\ncomputationally infeasible. Our key idea for solving this computational issue\nis to exploit the underlying tree structure among high-order interaction\nfeatures. Specifically, we introduce a pruning condition called safe feature\npruning (SFP) rule which has a property that, if the rule is satisfied in a\ncertain node of the tree, then all the high-order interaction features\ncorresponding to its descendant nodes can be guaranteed to be non-active at the\noptimal solution.

In this\npaper we propose a new LPBL selection method based on the mid-infrared\nemission, in addition to the traditional optical indices. We considered the\nradio-selected sample of Best & Heckman (2012, MNRAS, 421, 1569) and\ncross-matched it with the WISE all-sky survey. In a new diagnostic plane\nincluding the W2-W3 color and the Dn(4000) index, LPBL are located in a region\nscarcely populated by other sources. By filtering objects with small emission\nline equivalent width, we isolated 36 LPBL candidates up to redshift 0.15.\nTheir radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz spans the range log L_r = 39.2-41.5 [erg/s].\nConsidering the completeness of our sample, we analyzed the BL Lac luminosity\nfunction (RLF), finding a dramatic paucity of LPBL with respect to the\nextrapolation of the RLF toward low power. This requires a break in the RLF\nlocated at log L_r~40.6 [erg/s]. The consequent peak in the BL Lacs number\ndensity is possibly the manifestation of a minimum power required to launch a\nrelativistic jet.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

We speak of\npseudo-telepathy when quantum entanglement serves to eliminate the classical\nneed to communicate. In earlier examples of pseudo-telepathy, classical\nprotocols could succeed with high probability unless the inputs were very\nlarge. Here we present a simple multi-party distributed problem for which the\ninputs and outputs consist of a single bit per player, and we present a perfect\nquantum protocol for it.
