The fluctuating pressure forces acting on a fluid particle are taken to\nbe a colored noise and follow a stationary process and are described by the\nUhlenbeck-Ornstein model while it appears plausible to take their correlation\ntime to have a power-law dependence on the flow Reynolds number $R_e$, thus\nintroducing a bridge between the Lagrangian quantities and the Eulerian\nparameters for this problem. This ansatz is in qualitative agreement with the\npossibility of a connection speculated earlier by Corrsin [26] between the\nwhite-noise representation for the fluctuating pressure forces and the\nlarge-$R_e$ assumption in the Kolmogorov [4] theory for the 3D fully developed\nturbulence (FDT) as well as the argument of Monin and Yaglom [23] and the\nresult of Sawford [13] and Borgas and Sawford [24] that the Lagrangian\nacceleration is delta-function auto-correlated in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It\nalso provides an insight into the result that the Richardson-Obukhov scaling\nholds only in the infinite-$R_e$ limit and disappears otherwise. This ansatz\nfurther confirms the Lin-Reid [18] conjecture regarding the connection between\nthe fluctuating pressure-force parameter and the energy dissipation rate in\nturbulence and leads to an $R_e$-dependent explicit relation between the two\nspeculated by Lin and Reid [18]. More specifically, this ansatz provides a\ndetermination of the Richardson-Obukhov constant $g$ as a function of $R_e$,\nwith an asymptotic constant value in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It is shown to\nlead to full agreement, in the small-$R_e$ limit as well, with the\nBatchelor-Townsend [27] scaling for the rate of change of the mean square\ninterparticle separation in 3D FDT, hence validating its soundness further.\n"]}]

Currently,\nmany researchers resort to microarray technology for identifying relevant\ngenetic prognostic markers, with particular attention on trimming or extending\na Cox regression model.\n  Among NSCLC, adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are two\nmajor histology subtypes.

The public health response was\nchallenged by difficulties with disease surveillance, which impacted subsequent\nanalysis and decision-making regarding optimal interventions. We developed a\nstage-structured model of Ebola virus disease (EVD). A key feature of the model\nis that it includes a generalized correction term accounting for factors such\nas the fraction of cases reported and fraction of the population at risk (e.g.\ndue to contact patterns, interventions, spatiotemporal spread, pre-existing\nimmunity, asymptomatic cases, etc.). We generated a range of short-term\nforecasts for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, which we then validated using\nsubsequent data. We also used the model to examine the uncertainty in the\nrelative contributions to transmission by the different stages of infection\n(early, late, and funeral). We found that a wide range of forecasted\ntrajectories fit approximately equally well to the early data. However, by\nincluding the correction factor term the best-fit models correctly forecasted\nEVD activity for all three countries, both individually and for all countries\ncombined. In particular, the model correctly forecasted the slow-down in\nLiberia, as well as the continued exponential growth in Sierra Leone through\nNovember 2014.

PS-W is a challenging material for microtomography\nsince it exhibits a random porous network at different length-scales (from\nnanometers to micrometers) and is hardly penetrable by X-rays. Furthermore,\ninner porosity causes strong internal scattering. The key challenges were,\nfirstly, to optimize the beam parameters considering the inherent trade-off\nbetween photon energy (penetration depth) and spatial resolution and, secondly,\nto develop effective signal filtering algorithms. Despite the limited\nsignal-to-noise ratio detected, large volumes of PS-W could be reconstructed\nwith good image quality and micrometric resolution (voxel size = 1.4 {\\mu}m).\nAs an important result, we report excellent image quality and higher\npenetration depth by applying the same setup on a ferrous microstructure,\nnamely a 10%W/Steel MMC used as interlayer between PS-W and a\nferritic/martensitic steel substrate. The paper reports a detailed 3D\nmorphological analysis of all inclusion types in PS-W and W/Steel, which led to\ndisclosure of a complex connected porous network in both media. The analysis is\npresented in terms of multiphase volume fraction, ratio of percolation and 3D\nshape descriptors. 3D percolation patterns are analyzed in detail and\nsensitivity towards segmentation threshold for the noise-affected PS-W region\nis discussed.

The left part is a GNR of width\n$W_{L}$, the middle part is a GNR of width $W_{M}$, and the right part is a GNR\nof width $W_{R}$. We assume that the left and right parts of the GNR\nheterojunction interact with the middle part only. Under this approximation,\nthe Hamiltonian of the system can be expressed as a block tridiagonal matrix.\nThe matrix elements of the tridiagonal matrix are computed using real space\nnearest neighbor orthogonal TB approximation. The electronic structure of the\nGNR heterojunction is analyzed by computing the density of states. We\ndemonstrate that for heterojunctions for which $W_{L} = W_{R}$, the band gap of\nthe system can be tuned continuously by varying the length of the middle part,\nthus providing a new approach to band gap engineering in GNRs.
