There are two kinds of\ntechniques for this purpose. The first, projective methods, builds an explicit\nlinear projection from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional one.\nOn the other hand, the nonlinear methods utilizes nonlinear and implicit\nmapping between the two spaces. In both cases, the methods considered in\nliterature have usually relied on computationally very intensive matrix\nfactorizations, frequently the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The\ncomputational burden of SVD quickly renders these dimension reduction methods\ninfeasible thanks to the ever-increasing sizes of the practical datasets.\n  In this paper, we present a new decomposition strategy, Reduced Basis\nDecomposition (RBD), which is inspired by the Reduced Basis Method (RBM). Given\n$X$ the high-dimensional data, the method approximates it by $Y \\, T (\\approx\nX)$ with $Y$ being the low-dimensional surrogate and $T$ the transformation\nmatrix. $Y$ is obtained through a greedy algorithm thus extremely efficient. In\nfact, it is significantly faster than SVD with comparable accuracy. $T$ can be\ncomputed on the fly. Moreover, unlike many compression algorithms, it easily\nfinds the mapping for an arbitrary ``out-of-sample'' vector and it comes with\nan ``error indicator'' certifying the accuracy of the compression. Numerical\nresults are shown validating these claims.\n"]}]

In ITER,\ndisruptions are expected to generate REs mainly through knock-on collisions,\nwhere enough momentum can be transferred from existing runaways to slow\nelectrons to transport the latter beyond a critical momentum, setting off an\navalanche of REs. Since knock-on runaways are usually scattered off with a\nsignificant perpendicular component of the momentum with respect to the local\nmagnetic field direction, these particles are highly magnetized. Consequently,\nthe momentum dynamics require a full 3-D kinetic description, since these\nelectrons are highly sensitive to the magnetic non-uniformity of a toroidal\nconfiguration. A bounce-averaged knock-on source term is derived. The\ngeneration of REs from the combined effect of Dreicer mechanism and knock-on\ncollision process is studied with the code LUKE, a solver of the 3-D linearized\nbounce-averaged relativistic electron Fokker-Planck equation, through the\ncalculation of the response of the electron distribution function to a constant\nparallel electric field. This work shows that the avalanche effect can be\nimportant even in non-disruptive scenarios. RE formation through knock-on\ncollisions is found to be strongly reduced when taking place off the magnetic\naxis, since trapped electrons cannot contribute to the RE population. The\nrelative importance of the avalanche mechanism is investigated as a function of\nthe key parameters for RE formation; the plasma temperature and the electric\nfield strength. In agreement with theoretical predictions, the simulations show\nthat in low temperature and E-field knock-on collisions are the dominant source\nof REs and can play a significant role for RE generation, including in\nnon-disruptive scenarios.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 12 figures"]}]

Our novel approach is to\nformulate the sum rate maximization problem as an equivalent multi-convex\noptimization problem by adding two sets of auxiliary variables. An iterative\nalgorithm which alternatingly adjusts the system variables and the auxiliary\nvariables is proposed to solve the multi-convex optimization problem. The\nproposed algorithm is applied to a downlink cellular scenario consisting of\nseveral cells each of which contains a base station serving several mobile\nstations. We examine the two cases, with or without several half-duplex\namplify-and-forward relays assisting the transmission. A sum power constraint\nat the base stations and a sum power constraint at the relays are assumed.\nFinally, we show that the proposed multi-convex formulation of the sum rate\nmaximization problem is applicable to many other wireless systems in which the\nestimated data symbols are multi-affine functions of the system variables.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures"]}]

We also show that $BV_{\\frac{n}{n-1}}(\\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ and\n$BV(\\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ are isometrically isomorphic, where $BV(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ is\ndefined as the space of all functions $u$ in $L^{1}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ such that\n$Du$ is a finite vector-valued measure. As a consequence of our\ncharacterizations, an old issue raised in Meyers-Ziemer [MZ] is resolved by\nconstructing a locally integrable function $f$ such that $f$ belongs to\n$BV(\\mathbb{R}^n)^{*}$ but $|f|$ does not. Moreover, we show that the measures\nin $BV_{\\frac{n}{n-1}}(\\mathbb{R}^n)^*$ coincide with the measures in $\\dot\nW^{1,1}(\\mathbb{R}^n)^*$, the dual of the homogeneous Sobolev space $\\dot\nW^{1,1}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, in the sense of isometric isomorphism. For a bounded\nopen set $\\Omega$ with Lipschitz boundary, we characterize the measures in the\ndual space $BV_0(\\Omega)^*$. One of the goals of this paper is to make precise\nthe definition of $BV_0(\\Omega)$, which is the space of functions of bounded\nvariation with zero trace on the boundary of $\\Omega$. We show that the\nmeasures in $BV_0(\\Omega)^*$ coincide with the measures in\n$W^{1,1}_0(\\Omega)^*$. Finally, the class of finite measures in $BV(\\Omega)^*$\nis also characterized.\n","Comment: 26 pages"]}]
