The virial theorem limiting BL power does not\napply to BL which is not closed system like the Sun or Galaxy systems and is\nstrongly dependent part of the infinitely extended in time and space large\nsystem.

While it is possible to predict its position\nby using effective models specifically built to reproduce some of the features\nof the underlying theory (QCD), the quality of the predictions (\\textit{e.g.},\nthe CEP position) obtained by such effective models, depends on whether solving\nthe model equations constitute a well- or ill-posed inverse problem.\n  Considering these predictions as being inverse problems provides tools to\nevaluate if the problem is ill-conditioned, meaning that infinitesimal\nvariations of the inputs of the model can cause comparatively large variations\nof the predictions. If it is ill-conditioned, it has major consequences because\nof finite variations that could come from experimental and/or theoretical\nerrors.\n  In the following, we shall apply such a reasoning on the predictions of a\nparticular Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model within the mean field + ring\napproximations, with special attention to the prediction of the chiral CEP\nposition in the $(T-\\mu)$ plane.

This prior information is encoded in the model\nthrough a truncated multivariate Ising Markov random field, which also takes\ninto consideration the facts that pixels cannot be empty (i.e, there is at\nleast one material present in each pixel), and that different materials may\nexhibit different degrees of spatial regularity.

Since\nproteins half-lives can be comparable to the cell-cycle length, randomness in\ncell-division times generates additional intercellular variability in protein\nlevels. Moreover, as many mRNA/protein species are expressed at low-copy\nnumbers, errors incurred in partitioning of molecules between the mother and\ndaughter cells are significant. We derive analytical formulas for the total\nnoise in protein levels for a general class of cell-division time and\npartitioning error distributions. Using a novel hybrid approach the total noise\nis decomposed into components arising from i) stochastic expression; ii)\npartitioning errors at the time of cell-division and iii) random cell-division\nevents.

We build the theory starting from fundamental properties of\nladder operators. Particularly, we show that the ladder operators of Hagedorn\nare a natural set obtained from the position and momentum operators using the\nsymplectic group. The idea that pervades our view of the Hagedorn wave packets\nis so-called symplectic covariance; it generalizes some of fundamental results\nconcerning the Hagedorn wave packets as well as simplifies their proofs. We\napply our formulation to show the existence of minimal uncertainty products for\nthe Hagedorn wave packets; it generalizes the one-dimensional result by\nHagedorn to multi-dimensions. The Hagedorn--Hermite correspondence also leads\nto an alternative derivation of the generating function for the Hagedorn wave\npackets and clarifies its relationship with the generating function for the\nHermite functions. This result, in turn, reveals the relationship between the\nHagedorn polynomials and the Hermite polynomials.\n","Comment: 31 pages"]}]

It may happen that none of the labels of the\nnodes is known and additionally there is no information about number of classes\nto which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has to be\nselected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is: \"labels of\nwhich nodes should be collected and used for learning in order to provide the\nbest classification accuracy for the whole network?\". Active learning and\ninference is a practical framework to study this problem.\n  A set of methods for active learning and inference for within network\nclassification is proposed and validated. The utility score calculation for\neach node based on network structure is the first step in the process. The\nscores enable to rank the nodes. Based on the ranking, a set of nodes, for\nwhich the labels are acquired, is selected (e.g. by taking top or bottom N from\nthe ranking). The new measure-neighbour methods proposed in the paper suggest\nnot obtaining labels of nodes from the ranking but rather acquiring labels of\ntheir neighbours. The paper examines 29 distinct formulations of utility score\nand selection methods reporting their impact on the results of two collective\nclassification algorithms: Iterative Classification Algorithm and Loopy Belief\nPropagation.\n  We advocate that the accuracy of presented methods depends on the structural\nproperties of the examined network. We claim that measure-neighbour methods\nwill work better than the regular methods for networks with higher clustering\ncoefficient and worse than regular methods for networks with low clustering\ncoefficient.
