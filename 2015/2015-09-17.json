The\nsynchronous variant of this protocol, in which each clock rings precisely at\ntimes $1,2,\\dots$, has been studied extensively. We prove the following results\nfor any $n$-vertex graph: In either version, the average spread time is at most\nlinear even if only the pull operation is used, and the guaranteed spread time\nis within a logarithmic factor of the average spread time, so it is $O(n\\log\nn)$. In the asynchronous version, both the average and guaranteed spread times\nare $\\Omega(\\log n)$. We give examples of graphs illustrating that these bounds\nare best possible up to constant factors. We also prove theoretical\nrelationships between the guaranteed spread times in the two versions. Firstly,\nin all graphs the guaranteed spread time in the asynchronous version is within\nan $O(\\log n)$ factor of that in the synchronous version, and this is tight.\nNext, we find examples of graphs whose asynchronous spread times are\nlogarithmic, but the synchronous versions are polynomially large. Finally, we\nshow for any graph that the ratio of the synchronous spread time to the\nasynchronous spread time is $O(n^{2/3})$.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

The organization of data is referred to as the data\nstructure's state, and the sequence of past operations constitutes the data\nstructure's history. A data structure state can therefore be used as an oracle\nto derive information about its history. As a result, for history-sensitive\napplications, such as privacy in e-voting, incremental signature schemes, and\nregulatory compliant data retention; it is imperative to conceal historical\ninformation contained within data structure states.\n  Data structure history can be hidden by making data structures history\nindependent. In this paper, we explore how to achieve history independence.\n  We observe that current history independence notions are significantly\nlimited in number and scope. There are two existing notions of history\nindependence -- weak history independence (WHI) and strong history independence\n(SHI). WHI does not protect against insider adversaries and SHI mandates\ncanonical representations, resulting in inefficiency.\n  We postulate the need for a broad, encompassing notion of history\nindependence, which can capture WHI, SHI, and a broad spectrum of new history\nindependence notions. To this end, we introduce $\\Delta$history independence\n($\\Delta$HI), a generic game-based framework that is malleable enough to\naccommodate existing and new history independence notions.\n  As an essential step towards formalizing $\\Delta$HI, we explore the concepts\nof abstract data types, data structures, machine models, memory representations\nand history independence. Finally, to bridge the gap between theory and\npractice, we outline a general recipe for building end-to-end, history\nindependent systems and demonstrate the use of the recipe in designing two\nhistory independent file systems.\n"]}]

Recently, the availability of large annotated\ntraining sets and the accessibility of affordable parallel computing resources\nvia GPUs have made it feasible for \"deep learning\" methods such as\nconvolutional networks (ConvNets) to succeed in image classification tasks.\nThese methods have the advantage that used classification features are trained\ndirectly from the imaging data. We present a fully-automated bottom-up method\nfor pancreas segmentation in computed tomography (CT) images of the abdomen.\nThe method is based on hierarchical coarse-to-fine classification of local\nimage regions (superpixels). Superpixels are extracted from the abdominal\nregion using Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). An initial probability\nresponse map is generated, using patch-level confidences and a two-level\ncascade of random forest classifiers, from which superpixel regions with\nprobabilities larger 0.5 are retained. These retained superpixels serve as a\nhighly sensitive initial input of the pancreas and its surroundings to a\nConvNet that samples a bounding box around each superpixel at different scales\n(and random non-rigid deformations at training time) in order to assign a more\ndistinct probability of each superpixel region being pancreas or not.

Using this\ndiffusion model, we obtain the steady-state distributions of virtual waiting\ntime and queue length, which in turn yield simple formulas for performance\nmeasures such as the service level and the effective abandonment fraction.\nThese formulas are generally accurate when the mean patience time is several\ntimes longer than the mean service time and the patience time distribution does\nnot change rapidly around the mean virtual waiting time.

The\nappearance energy of the fragment ion indicative of the loss of a H atom\nfollowing photoionization is also similar for either ethynyl-substituted PAH\nmolecule and its non-substituted counterpart.

Excellent\nagreements were obtained, such as the values for luminous efficiencies in a\ntropical and humid climate. In this paper, a comparison of the model output\nwith detailed measures is presented using a dedicated test cell in Reunion\nIsland (French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean), thus confirming the\ninterest for thermal and daylighting designs in low-energy buildings.\nIntroduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow\nsimulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2],\nand TRNSYS [3]. These applications allow an increasing number of models to be\nintegrated, such as airflow, pollutant transport, and daylighting. In the\nlatter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After\nmore than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to\nadd a lighting module to our software. This paper therefore provides some\ndetails on this evolution and elements of validation. The CODYRUN initial\nsoftware and its validation Developed by the Physics and Mathematical\nEngineering Laboratory for Energy and Environment at the University of Reunion\nIsland, CODYRUN [5-14] is a multi-zone software program integrating ventilation\nand moisture transport transfer in buildings. The software employs a zone\napproach based on nodal analysis and resolves a coupled system describing\nthermal and airflow phenomena. Numerous validation tests of the CODYRUN code\nwere successfully applied to the software. Apart from the daylighting model,\nthe majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. The International Energy\nAgency (IEA) sponsors a number of programs to improve the use and associated\ntechnologies of energy. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\ndeveloped BESTEST, which is a method based on comparative testing of building\nsimulation programs, on the IEA's behalf. The procedure consists of a series of\ntest cases buildings that are designed to isolate individual aspects of\nbuilding energy and test the extremes of a program. As the modelling approach\nis very different between codes, the test cases are specified so that input\nequivalency can be defined thus allowing the different cases to be modelled by\nmost of codes. The basis for comparison is a range of results from a number of\nprograms considered to be a state-of-art in United States and Europe.\nAssociated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of\nvalidation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].\n","Comment: ICRET 2014 : 2014 International Conference on Renewable Energy\n  Technologies, Nov 2014, Hong Kong, China. 2014"]}]

We use our architecture to anticipate driving maneuvers several\nseconds before they happen on a natural driving data set of 1180 miles. The\ncontext for maneuver anticipation comes from multiple sensors installed on the\nvehicle.
