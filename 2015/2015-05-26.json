Similarly, the complexity class\nTheta(k) is related to the closure of the k-th level of the CFL hierarchy under\nlog-space truth-table reductions. We also argue that the CFL hierarchy\ncoincides with a hierarchy over CFL built by application of many-one\nCFL-reductions.

Databases with strong support of\nsparse operations, such as SciDB or Apache Accumulo, are ideally suited to this\ntechnique. Examples are shown for the application of CMD to a complex DNA\nmatching algorithm and to database operations over social media data.\n","Comment: to appear in IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing 2014\n  (ieee-hpec.org)"]}]

The\ncalculations provide clear illustrations of this system for three cases: a) the\nmoving charges of the magnet are assumed to continue in their unperturbed\nmotion, b) the moving charges of the magnet are free to accelerate but have no\nmutual interactions, and c) the moving charges of the magnet are free to\naccelerate and also interact with each other. It is noted that when the\ncurrent-carrying charges of the magnet are allowed to interact, the magnet\nitself will contain internal electromagnetic linear momentum, something which\nhas not been presented clearly in the research and teaching literature.\n","Comment: 23 pages.

In\nthe case studied here, topological order is reflected in the presence of two\n(nearly) isolated Majorana fermionic end bound modes together forming an\nelectronic state that can be occupied or not, leading to two (nearly)\ndegenerate ground states characterized by fermion parity. Our study begins with\na characterization of the static properties of the finite-sized wire, including\nthe behavior of the Majorana end modes and the form of the tunnel coupling\nbetween them; a transfer matrix approach to analytically determine the\nlocations of the zero energy contours where this coupling vanishes; and a\nPfaffian approach to map the ground state parity in the associated phase\ndiagram. We next study the quench dynamics resulting from initializing the\nsystem in a topological ground state and then dynamically tuning one of the\nparameters of the Hamiltonian. For this, we develop a dynamic quantum many-body\ntechnique that invokes a Wick's theorem for Majorana fermions, vastly reducing\nthe numerical effort given the exponentially large Hilbert space. We\ninvestigate the salient and detailed features of two dynamic quantities - the\noverlap between the time-evolved state and the instantaneous ground state\n(adiabatic fidelity) and the residual energy. When the parity of the\ninstantaneous ground state flips successively with time, we find that the\ntime-evolved state can dramatically switch back and forth between this state\nand an excited state even when the quenching is very slow, a phenomenon that we\nterm \"parity blocking\".

We perform experiments using the the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset,\nwhich is designed for the task of classifying the relationship between two\nnominals marked in a sentence. Using CRCNN, we outperform the state-of-the-art\nfor this dataset and achieve a F1 of 84.1 without using any costly handcrafted\nfeatures. Additionally, our experimental results show that: (1) our approach is\nmore effective than CNN followed by a softmax classifier; (2) omitting the\nrepresentation of the artificial class Other improves both precision and\nrecall; and (3) using only word embeddings as input features is enough to\nachieve state-of-the-art results if we consider only the text between the two\ntarget nominals.\n","Comment: Accepted as a long paper in the 53rd Annual Meeting of the\n  Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2015)"]}]

We derive a closed\nalgebraic formula which well-approximates the shrinking time as a function of\nWD cooling age, the physical properties of the star and the physical and\norbital properties of the ring particles. The shrinking timescale increases\nwith both particle size and cooling age, yielding age-dependent WD debris disc\nsize distributions.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Specifically, in information-theoretic $k$-server\nPIR, the database is replicated among $k$ non-communicating servers, and each\nserver learns nothing about the item retrieved by the user. The cost of PIR\nprotocols is usually measured in terms of their communication complexity, which\nis the total number of bits exchanged between the user and the servers, and\nstorage overhead, which is the ratio between the total number of bits stored on\nall the servers and the number of bits in the database. Since single-server\ninformation-theoretic PIR is impossible, the storage overhead of all existing\nPIR protocols is at least $2$.\n  In this work, we show that information-theoretic PIR can be achieved with\nstorage overhead arbitrarily close to the optimal value of $1$, without\nsacrificing the communication complexity. Specifically, we prove that all known\n$k$-server PIR protocols can be efficiently emulated, while preserving both\nprivacy and communication complexity but significantly reducing the storage\noverhead. To this end, we distribute the $n$ bits of the database among $s+r$\nservers, each storing $n/s$ coded bits (rather than replicas). For every fixed\n$k$, the resulting storage overhead $(s+r)/s$ approaches $1$ as $s$ grows;\nexplicitly we have $r\\le k\\sqrt{s}(1+o(1))$. Moreover, in the special case $k =\n2$, the storage overhead is only $1 + \\frac{1}{s}$. In order to achieve these\nresults, we introduce and study a new kind of binary linear codes, called here\n$k$-server PIR codes. We then show how such codes can be constructed, and we\nestablish several bounds on the parameters of $k$-server PIR codes.

A geometrical\ndecomposition of the screw extruder in a partially and a fully filled regions\n(PFZ and FFZ) allows to describe the material convection in the extruder\nchamber by a 1D hyperbolic Partial Differential Equation (PDE) coupled with an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE). After solving the hyperbolic PDE by the\nMethod of Characteristics (MC), the coupled PDE-ODE's system is transformed\ninto a nonlinear state-dependent input delay system. The aforementioned delay\nsystem is extended to the nonisothermal case with the consideration of periodic\nfluctuations acting on the material's convection speed, which represent the\neffect of viscosity variations due to temperature changes in the extruder\nchamber, resulting to a nonlinear system with an input delay that\nsimultaneously depends on the state and the time variable. Global Exponential\nStability (GES) of the nonlinear delay-free plant is established under a\npiecewise exponential feedback controller that is designed. By combining the\nnominal, piecewise exponential feedback controller with nonlinear predictor\nfeedback the compensation of the time- and state-dependent input delay of the\nextruder model is achieved.

Various MX2-type transition metal\ndichalcogenides, such as WTe2, IrTe2, and MoS2, have triggered great attention\nrecently, either for the discovery of novel phenomena or some extreme or exotic\nphysical properties, or for their potential applications. PdTe2 is a\nsuperconductor in the class of transition metal dichalcogenides, and\nsuperconductivity is enhanced in its Cu-intercalated form, Cu0.05PdTe2. It is\nimportant to study the electronic structures of PdTe2 and its intercalated form\nin order to explore for new phenomena and physical properties and understand\nthe related superconductivity enhancement mechanism. Here we report systematic\nhigh resolution angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) studies on PdTe2 and\nCu0.05$PdTe2 single crystals, combined with the band structure calculations. We\npresent for the first time in detail the complex multi-band Fermi surface\ntopology and densely-arranged band structure of these compounds.

Several tests are SU in finite\nsamples or asymptotically, including tests robust to weak IV (such as the\nAnderson-Rubin, score, conditional quasi-likelihood ratio, and I.

The same change of variable also renders the Kolmogorov\nequation with the effect of mutations added separable, as long as the mutation\nmatrix has equal entries in each row.

We focus on the growth of fixation times\nwith the number of subpopulations, and variation of fixation probabilities and\ntimes with initial distributions of mutants. A general formula for the fixation\nprobability for arbitrary initial condition is derived by extending a duality\nrelation between forwards- and backwards-time properties of the model from a\npanmictic to a subdivided population. From this we obtain new formulae,\nformally exact in the limit of extremely weak migration, for the mean fixation\ntime from an arbitrary initial condition for Wright's island model, presenting\ntwo cases as examples.

These formulae contain\nparameters that typically have to be obtained numerically, a procedure we\nfollow for two contrasting clustered models. These data suggest that variation\nof fixation time with the initial condition is slight, but depends strongly on\nthe nature of subdivision. In particular, we demonstrate conditions under which\nthe fixation time remains finite even in the limit of an infinite number of\ndemes.
