Similarly, the complexity class\nTheta(k) is related to the closure of the k-th level of the CFL hierarchy under\nlog-space truth-table reductions. We also argue that the CFL hierarchy\ncoincides with a hierarchy over CFL built by application of many-one\nCFL-reductions.

We seek correlations between R(M) and the stiffness of the EOS\nbelow the hyperon threshold needed to pass the 2 Msun test. For NS masses\n1.0<M/Msun<1.6, we get R>13km, because of a very stiff pre-hyperon segment of\nthe EOS. At nuclear density, the pressure is significantly higher than a robust\nupper bound obtained recently using chiral effective field theory.\n  If massive NSs do have a sizable hyperon core, then according to current\nmodels the radii for M=1.0-1.6 Msun are necessarily >13km. If, on the contrary,\na NS with a radius R<12 km is observed in this mass domain, then sizable\nhyperon cores in NSs, as we model them now, are ruled out. Future X-ray\nmissions with <5% precision for a simultaneous M and R measurement will have\nthe potential to solve the problem with observations of NSs. Irrespective of\nthis observational test, present EOS allowing for hyperons that fulfill\ncondition M_max>2 Msun yield a pressure at nuclear density that is too high\nrelative to up-to-date microscopic calculations of this quantity.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, published in A&A"]}]

In addition, metal whiskers exhibit a rather\nunusual dynamic property of relatively high amplitude movements under gentle\nair flow or, according to some testimonies, without obvious stimuli.\nUnderstanding the physics behind that motion would give additional insights\ninto the nature of metal whiskers. Here, we quantitatively analyze several\npossible mechanisms potentially responsible for the observed movements: (1)\nminute air currents, (2) Brownian motion due to random bombardments with the\nair molecules, (3) mechanically caused movements, such as (a) externally\ntransmitted vibrations of the sample, and (b) torque exerted due to material\npropagation along curved whiskers responsible for the whisker growth (similar\nto the known garden hose oscillations), (4) time dependent electric fields due\nto diffusion of ions across the metal surface, and (5) nonequilibrium electric\nfield configurations making it possible for {\\it some} whiskers to move. For\nall these scenarios we provide numerical estimates. Our conclusion is that the\nobserved movements are likely due to the minor air currents, intentional or\nill-controlled, and that external mechanical vibrations could force such\nmovements in a rather harsh environment or/and for whiskers with severe\nconstrictions.

The second\nstep, eliminating the intrinsic quadratic nature of SSIM, allows a near linear\ncorrelation with human observer scores, and without invoking the usual, but\narbitrary, sigmoid model fitting.

We use the term\nDissimilarity Quotient (DQ) for the specifically anti/symmetric SSIM derived\nNVF.

Specifically, in information-theoretic $k$-server\nPIR, the database is replicated among $k$ non-communicating servers, and each\nserver learns nothing about the item retrieved by the user. The cost of PIR\nprotocols is usually measured in terms of their communication complexity, which\nis the total number of bits exchanged between the user and the servers, and\nstorage overhead, which is the ratio between the total number of bits stored on\nall the servers and the number of bits in the database. Since single-server\ninformation-theoretic PIR is impossible, the storage overhead of all existing\nPIR protocols is at least $2$.\n  In this work, we show that information-theoretic PIR can be achieved with\nstorage overhead arbitrarily close to the optimal value of $1$, without\nsacrificing the communication complexity. Specifically, we prove that all known\n$k$-server PIR protocols can be efficiently emulated, while preserving both\nprivacy and communication complexity but significantly reducing the storage\noverhead. To this end, we distribute the $n$ bits of the database among $s+r$\nservers, each storing $n/s$ coded bits (rather than replicas). For every fixed\n$k$, the resulting storage overhead $(s+r)/s$ approaches $1$ as $s$ grows;\nexplicitly we have $r\\le k\\sqrt{s}(1+o(1))$. Moreover, in the special case $k =\n2$, the storage overhead is only $1 + \\frac{1}{s}$. In order to achieve these\nresults, we introduce and study a new kind of binary linear codes, called here\n$k$-server PIR codes. We then show how such codes can be constructed, and we\nestablish several bounds on the parameters of $k$-server PIR codes. Finally, we\nbriefly discuss extensions of our results to nonbinary alphabets, to robust\nPIR, and to $t$-private PIR.\n"]}]

Currently, the impact of the grid structure on the grid robustness is\nmainly assessed by purely topological metrics, that fail to capture the\nfundamental properties of the electrical power grids such as power flow\nallocation according to Kirchhoff's laws. This paper deploys the effective\ngraph resistance as a metric to relate the topology of a grid to its robustness\nagainst cascading failures.

More particularly, our supercharged solution substantially\nreduces the convergence time of an IP router upon link or node failure without\ninducing any reconfiguration of the IP router itself. Our key insight is to use\nthe SDN controller to precompute backup forwarding entries and immediately\nactivate them upon failure, enabling almost immediate data-plane recovery,\nwhile letting the router converge at its typical slow pace. By boosting\nexisting equipment's performance, we not only increase their lifetime but also\nprovide new incentives for network operators to kickstart SDN deployment.\n  We implemented a fully functional \"supercharger\" and use it to boost the\nconvergence performance of a Cisco Nexus 7k router.

We\nintroduce two weights which are invariant to orthogonal transformations of the\ninstruments; e.g., changing the order in which the instruments appear.

Several tests are SU in finite\nsamples or asymptotically, including tests robust to weak IV (such as the\nAnderson-Rubin, score, conditional quasi-likelihood ratio, and I.
