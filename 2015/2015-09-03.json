Since\nz=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(Sigma_e) and\nlog(Sigma_1) vs. log(M). These structural relations exhibit slopes and scatter\nthat remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. For\nSFGs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in both\nSigma_e and Sigma_1. Such mild declines suggest that SFGs build dense cores by\ngrowing along these relations. We define this evolution as the structural main\nsequence (Sigma-MS). Quiescent galaxies follow different relations (Sigma^Q_e,\nSigma^Q_1) off the Sigma-MS by having higher densities than SFGs of the same\nmass and redshift. The normalization of Sigma^Q_e declines by a factor of 10\nsince z=3, but only a factor of 2 in Sigma^Q_1. Thus, the common denominator\nfor quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellar\ncore, and the formation of such cores in SFGs is the main requirement for\nquenching. Expressed in 2D as deviations off the SFR-MS and off Sigma^Q_1 at\neach redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, L-shaped\nsequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction and\nquenching. Compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in SFGs relative\nto that in the Sigma-MS. This process increases the core-to-total mass and\nSersic index, thereby, making compact SFGs. Quenching occurs once compact SFGs\nreach a maximum central density above Sigma^Q_1 > 9.5 M_sun/kpc^2.

Content caching at base stations (BSs) is a\npromising approach to alleviate the backhaul burden and reduce user-perceived\nlatency. In this paper, we consider a wireless caching network where all the\nBSs are connected to a central controller via backhaul links. In such a\nnetwork, users can obtain the required data from candidate BSs if the data are\npre-cached. Otherwise, the user data need to be first retrieved from the\ncentral controller to local BSs, which introduces extra delay over the\nbackhaul. In order to reduce the download delay, the caching placement strategy\nneeds to be optimized. We formulate such a design problem as the minimization\nof the average download delay over user requests, subject to the caching\ncapacity constraint of each BS. Different from existing works, our model takes\nBS cooperation in the radio access into consideration and is fully aware of the\npropagation delay on the backhaul links. The design problem is a mixed integer\nprogramming problem and is highly complicated, and thus we relax the problem\nand propose a low-complexity algorithm. Simulation results will show that the\nproposed algorithm can effectively determine the near-optimal caching placement\nand provide significant performance gains over conventional caching placement\nstrategies.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, accepted to IEEE Globecom, San Diego, CA, Dec.\n  2015"]}]

The maximum phase of SC 24 in the\nGCR intensity is still in progress. 2) The inversion of the heliospheric\nmagnetic field consists of three stages, characterized by the appearance of the\nglobal heliospheric current sheet (HCS), connecting all longitudes. In two\ntransition dipole stages beside the global HCS there are additional local HCSs,\nwhile the inversion stage lies between two transition dipole ones and there is\nno global HCS in this stage. The inversion stage of the current SC 24 is the\nlongest when compared with those for SC 21-23. The second transition dipole\nstage and hence the whole inversion period of the heliospheric magnetic field\nin SC 24 provisionally ended in 08.2014. 3) The behavior of the GCR intensity\nin the period of the sunspot maximum phase and the inversion of the\nheliospheric magnetic fields for SC 21-23 demonstrates all the characteristic\nfeatures for this period: the two-gap structure corresponding to two-peak\nstructure in the sunspot activity, and the energy hysteresis.

For the time being there is a long-lasting controversy on how\nthese long-term variations, observed for more than 50 years in the inner\nheliosphere, are formed. It is widely believed that the 11-year variation is\ndue entirely to the toroidal branch of solar activity (the area and number of\nsunspots, the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field etc) because of the\ndiffusion, convection and adiabatic energy loss, while the much smaller 22-year\nvariation is caused by the particle drifts connected with the poloidal branch\nof solar activity (the high-latitude solar magnetic fields). At the same time,\nboth past and more recent numerical simulations indicate that the contribution\nof particle drifts could be significant for both 22- and 11-year variations in\nthe GCR intensities. However, even those who agree on the significant influence\nof drifts appear to have different perceptions on the mechanisms of this\ninfluence. In this paper, we present an analysis of the possible causes of the\nfirst point of view (small role of drifts in the 11-year GCR variation) and the\nreasons why one can expect the significant contri- bution of the processes\nconnected with the poloidal branch of solar activity in both types of the\nlong-term variations of the GCR characteristics.

The\nmultiple feedback (MF) strategy in successive interference cancellation (SIC)\nis based on the concept of shadow area constraint (SAC) where, if the decision\nfalls in the shadow region multiple neighboring constellation points will be\nused in the decision feedback loop followed by the conventional SIC. The best\ncandidate symbol from multiple neighboring symbols is selected using the\nmaximum likelihood (ML) criteria. However, while deciding the best symbol from\nmultiple neighboring symbols, the SAC condition may occur in subsequent layers\nwhich results in inaccurate decision. In order to overcome this limitation, in\nthe proposed algorithm, SAC criteria is checked recursively for each layer.\nThis results in successful mitigation of error propagation thus significantly\nimproving the bit error rate (BER) performance. Further, we also propose an\nordered IMF-SIC (OIMF-SIC) where we use log likelihood ratio (LLR) based\ndynamic ordering of the detection sequence. In OIMF-SIC, we use the term\ndynamic ordering in the sense that the detection order is updated after every\nsuccessful decision.

Clustering aims to divide a data set into groups or\nclusters where inter-cluster similarities are minimized while the intra cluster\nsimilarities are maximized. This paper reviews four of the popularly used\nclustering techniques: k-Means, k-Medoids, Leader and DBSCAN. These techniques\nare implemented and tested against the Web user navigational data. Performance\nand validity results of each technique are presented and compared.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1507.03340"]}]

Planetary magnetic fields, however,\nconstitute one of the shielding layers that protect the planet against\ncosmic-ray particles. In particular, a weak magnetic field results in a high\nflux of Galactic cosmic rays that extends to the top of the planetary\natmosphere. We wish to quantify the flux of Galactic cosmic rays to an\nexoplanetary atmosphere as a function of the particle energy and of the\nplanetary magnetic moment. We numerically analyzed the propagation of Galactic\ncosmic-ray particles through planetary magnetospheres. We evaluated the\nefficiency of magnetospheric shielding as a function of the particle energy (in\nthe range 16 MeV $\\le$ E $\\le$ 524 GeV) and as a function of the planetary\nmagnetic field strength (in the range 0 ${M}_\\oplus$ $\\le$ {M} $\\le$ 10\n${M}_\\oplus$). Combined with the flux outside the planetary magnetosphere, this\ngives the cosmic-ray energy spectrum at the top of the planetary atmosphere as\na function of the planetary magnetic moment. We find that the particle flux to\nthe planetary atmosphere can be increased by more than three orders of\nmagnitude in the absence of a protecting magnetic field. For a weakly\nmagnetized planet (${M}=0.05\\,{M}_{\\oplus}$), only particles with energies\nbelow 512 MeV are at least partially shielded. For a planet with a magnetic\nmoment similar to Earth, this limit increases to 32 GeV, whereas for a strongly\nmagnetized planet ($M=10.0\\,{M}_{\\oplus}$), partial shielding extends up to 200\nGeV. We find that magnetic shielding strongly controls the number of cosmic-ray\nparticles reaching the planetary atmosphere. The implications of this increased\nparticle flux are discussed in a companion article.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures; accepted in A&A"]}]

In the present paper we give a\nglobal expression for $e^{itH}$ in terms of Gabor analysis and we deduce\nboundedness in modulation spaces.
