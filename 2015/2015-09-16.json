Indeed, the evolution of rotation\nand activity among these stars appears to be so deterministic that their\nrotation/activity diagnostics are often utilized as estimators of stellar age.\nA primary motivation for the recent interest in improving the ages of\nsolar-type field dwarfs is in understanding the evolution of debris disks and\nplanetary systems. Reliable isochronal age-dating for field, solar-type main\nsequence stars is very difficult given the observational uncertainties and\nmulti-Gyr timescales for significant structural evolution. Observationally,\nsignificant databases of activity/rotation diagnostics exist for field\nsolar-type field dwarfs (mainly from chromospheric and X-ray activity surveys).\nBut how well can we empirically age-date solar-type field stars using\nactivity/rotation diagnostics? Here I summarize some recent results for F7-K2\ndwarfs from an analysis by Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008), including an improved\n\"gyrochronology\" [Period(color, age)] calibration, improved chromospheric\n(R'_HK and X-ray (log Lx/Lbol) activity vs. rotation (via Rossby number)\nrelations, and a chromospheric vs. X-ray activity relation that spans four\norders of magnitude in log Lx/Lbol.

While the line polarisation is positive (negative)\nfor an oblate (prolate) morphology at the peak and in the red wing, the\ncontinuum polarisation may be of any sign. These complex polarisation\nvariations are produced not just by the asymmetric distribution of scatterers\nbut also of the flux. Our early-time signatures are in contradiction with\npredictions for a centrally illuminated aspherical nebula, although this\nbecomes a better approximation at nebular times. For a fixed asymmetry, our\nsynthetic continuum polarisation is generally low, may evolve non-monotonically\nduring the plateau phase, but it systematically rises as the ejecta become\noptically thin. Changes in polarization over time do not necessarily imply a\nchange in the asymmetry of the ejecta. The SN structure (e.g.,\ndensity/ionization) critically influences the level of polarisation.\nImportantly, a low polarisation (<0.5%) at early times does not necessarily\nimply a low degree of asymmetry as usually assumed.

Our work is based on a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20\nmicron silicate emission features for brown dwarfs in the Taurus-Auriga\nstar-forming region. A fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfs\nexhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk,\ncompared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our\ntargets, we find a flat disk structure, which is consistent with the stronger\nsigns of dust processing observed in these disks.

Simple large-scale\nradial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical\ncomposition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in\nthis disk. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer\ncold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets.

It was previously\nbelieved that the surface of an ETI must be gapless unless one of these\nsymmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface\ntermination of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we\ndeduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped surface termination of an ETI, which\ncarries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion. The\nMoore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian,\nanti-semion sector is electrically neutral. Time-reversal symmetry is\nimplemented in this surface phase in a highly non-trivial way. Moreover, it is\nimpossible to realize this phase strictly in 2d, simultaneously preserving its\nimplementation of both the particle number and time-reversal symmetries. A 1d\nedge on the ETI surface between the topologically-ordered phase and the\ntopologically trivial time-reversal-broken phase with a Hall conductivity\nsigma_H = 1/2, carries a right-moving neutral Majorana mode, a right-moving\nbosonic charge mode and a left-moving bosonic neutral mode. The\ntopologically-ordered phase is separated from the surface superconductor by a\ndirect second order phase transition in the XY* universality class, which is\ndriven by the condensation of a charge 1/2 boson, when approached from the\ntopologically-ordered side, and proliferation of a flux 4\\pi-vortex, when\napproached from the superconducting side.

Their grouping is consistent with\nhierarchical and fractal star cluster formation. We use deep Ha imaging data to\ndetermine the current Star Formation Rate (SFR) in NGC 1427A and estimate the\nratio, Gamma, of star formation occurring in these star cluster complexes to\nthat in the entire galaxy. We find Gamma to be among the largest such values\navailable in the literature, consistent with starburst galaxies. Thus a large\nfraction of the current star formation in NGC 1427A is occurring in star\nclusters, with the peculiar spatial arrangement of such complexes strongly\nhinting at the possibility that the starburst is being triggered by the passage\nof the galaxy through the cluster environment.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in The Astronomical\n  Journal.

A few new rare outliers (HSP-FSRQs and\nhigh-luminosity HSP BL~Lacs) are reported. The general properties of the 3LAC\nsample confirm previous findings from earlier catalogs. The fraction of 3LAC\nblazars in the total population of blazars listed in BZCAT remains\nnon-negligible even at the faint ends of the BZCAT-blazar radio, optical and\nX-ray flux distributions, which is a clue that even the faintest known blazars\ncould eventually shine in gamma rays at LAT-detection levels.

This allows us to study and exploit graphene Josephson junctions in a\nnew regime, characterized by ballistic transport.

For each individual task model, researchers tend to develop\ndifferent types of techniques for deriving schedulability tests with different\ncomputation complexity and performance. In this paper, we present a general\nschedulability analysis framework, namely the k2U framework, that can be\npotentially applied to analyze a large set of real-time task models under any\nfixed-priority scheduling algorithm, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor\nscheduling. The key to k2U is a k-point effective schedulability test, which\ncan be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface. For any task model, if a corresponding\nk-point effective schedulability test can be constructed, then a sufficient\nutilization-based test can be automatically derived. We show the generality of\nk2U by applying it to different task models, which results in new and improved\ntests compared to the state-of-the-art.\n  Analogously, a similar concept by testing only k points with a different\nformulation has been studied by us in another framework, called k2Q, which\nprovides quadratic bounds or utilization bounds based on a different\nformulation of schedulability test. With the quadratic and hyperbolic forms,\nk2Q and k2U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be\nmeasured, like the total utilization bounds, speed-up factors, etc., not only\nfor uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling.

However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the\npredictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are\nbased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe\ntwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded\nprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a\nrange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star.

We find that the inner and\nouter spiral wakes of massive protoplanets (M>5 M_jup) produce significant\nshock heating that can trigger buoyant instabilities. These drive sustained\nturbulence throughout the disk when they occur. The strength of this effect\ndepends strongly on the mass of the planet and the thermal relaxation\ntimescale; for a 10 M_jup planet embedded in a thin, purely adiabatic disk, the\nspirals, gaps, and vortices typically associated with planet-disk interactions\nare disrupted.

Past studies of this problem neglect these fluctuations and\nwork under the assumption that the collisions posess an exact SO(2,1) symmetry.\nWe use three-dimensional lattice simulations to demonstrate that for\ndouble-well potentials, small initial perturbations to this symmetry can be\namplified as the system evolves. Initially the amplification is well-described\nby linear perturbation theory around the SO(2,1) background, but the onset of\nstrong nonlinearities amongst the fluctuations quickly leads to a drastic\nbreaking of the original SO(2,1) symmetry and the production of oscillons in\nthe collision region. We explore several single-field models, and we find it is\nhard to both realize inflation inside of a bubble and produce oscillons in a\ncollision. Finally, we extend our results to a simple two-field model. The\nadditional freedom allowed by the second field allows us to construct viable\ninflationary models that allow oscillon production in collisions. The breaking\nof the SO(2,1) symmetry allows for a new class of observational signatures from\nbubble collisions that do not posess azimuthal symmetry, including the\nproduction of gravitational waves which cannot be supported by an SO(2,1)\nspacetime.\n","Comment: 35 pages + references, 26 figures.

Recent observations\nsuggest that many flaring disks have gaps, whereas flat disks are thought to be\ngapless. The different groups of objects can be expected to have different\nstructural signatures in high-angular-resolution data. Over the past 10 years,\nthe MIDI instrument on the Very Large Telescope Interferometer has collected\nobservations of several tens of protoplanetary disks. We model the large set of\nobservations with simple geometric models. A population of radiative-transfer\nmodels is synthesized for interpreting the mid-infrared signatures. Objects\nwith similar luminosities show very different disk sizes in the mid-infrared.\nRestricting to the young objects of intermediate mass, we confirm that most\ngroup I disks are in agreement with being transitional. We find that several\ngroup II objects have mid-infrared sizes and colors overlapping with sources\nclassified as group I, transition disks. This suggests that these sources have\ngaps, which has been demonstrated for a subset of them. This may point to an\nintermediate population between gapless and transition disks. Flat disks with\ngaps are most likely descendants of flat disks without gaps. Gaps, potentially\nrelated to the formation of massive bodies, may therefore even develop in disks\nin a far stage of grain growth and settling. The evolutionary implications of\nthis new population could be twofold. Either gapped flat disks form a separate\npopulation of evolved disks, or some of them may further evolve into flaring\ndisks with large gaps. The latter transformation may be governed by the\ninteraction with a massive planet, carving a large gap and dynamically exciting\nthe grain population in the disk.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 11 figures, A&A in press"]}]

Although VSIDS was proposed nearly fifteen years ago, and many\nother branching heuristics for SAT solving have since been proposed, VSIDS\nremains one of the most effective branching heuristics.\n  In this paper, we advance our understanding of VSIDS by answering the\nfollowing key questions. The first question we pose is \"what is special about\nthe class of variables that VSIDS chooses to additively bump?\" In answering\nthis question we showed that VSIDS overwhelmingly picks, bumps, and learns\nbridge variables, defined as the variables that connect distinct communities in\nthe community structure of SAT instances. This is surprising since VSIDS was\ninvented more than a decade before the link between community structure and SAT\nsolver performance was discovered. Additionally, we show that VSIDS viewed as a\nranking function correlates strongly with temporal graph centrality measures.\nPutting these two findings together, we conclude that VSIDS picks\nhigh-centrality bridge variables. The second question we pose is \"what role\ndoes multiplicative decay play in making VSIDS so effective?\" We show that the\nmultiplicative decay behaves like an exponential moving average (EMA) that\nfavors variables that persistently occur in conflicts (the signal) over\nvariables that occur intermittently (the noise). The third question we pose is\n\"whether VSIDS is temporally and spatially focused.\" We show that VSIDS\ndisproportionately picks variables from a few communities unlike, say, the\nrandom branching heuristic.

When a transition occurs from the lower branch to the upper branch (or\nfrom the upper branch to the lower branch), the surface density rapidly\nincreases (decreases) around that transition region, which induces locally\nenhanced mass flow (referred to as non-steady mass flow) into (out of) that\nregion.

However, the non-steady mass flow\nis not strong enough to induce coherent transition over the whole disk, unless\nthe mass injection rate varies with time. When the injection rate continuously\nchanges, the neutrino luminosity varies intermittently, thus producing\nstep-function-like light curves, as the radiation efficiency discontinuously\nchanges every time the local transition occurs.

Therefore if the well measured RMGs and their evolution\nfor Milky Way-like galaxies are obtained from future observations, then our\nresults will be useful to constrain the main driving mechanism for their\ngalactic outflows.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

Results: We reveal\na collimated jet component associated with the [OI] 63 micron emission at about\n8'' (about 960 AU) from source B. This newly detected jet component is\ninversely oriented with respect to the large-scale outflow driven by source A,\nand it is aligned with compact and fast jet emission very close to source B\n(about 0.3'') rather than with the direction perpendicular to the A disk.

The\nsecond pattern occurred during the later stage of evolution when the tornado\nalready stopped rising and could be caused either by MHD kink waves in the\ntornado or by the rotation of two tornado threads around a common axis.

For a semi-flexible polymer with a\npersistence length P , its statistics is self-avoiding for a very long chain.\nAs the local force increases, the blob size starts to decrease. At the blob\nsize P/a^2 , where a is the size of a monomer, the statistics becomes that of\nan ideal chain. As the blob size further decreases to below the persistence\nlength P, the statistics is that of a rigid rod. We argue that semi-flexible\npolymer in translocation should include the three regions: a self-avoiding\nregion, an ideal chain region and a rigid rod region, under uneven tension\npropagation, instead of a uniform scaling picture as in the case of a\ncompletely flexible polymer. In various regimes under the effect of weak,\nintermediate and strong driving forces we derive equations from which we can\ncalculate the translocation time of the polymer. The translocation exponent is\ngiven by \\alpha=1+\\mu, where \\mu is an effective exponent for the end-to-end\ndistance of the semi-flexible polymer, having a value between 1/2 and 3/5,\ndepending on the total contour length of the polymer. Our results are of\nrelevance for forced translocation of biological polymers such as DNA through a\nnanopore.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 3 figures"]}]

STM systems take optimistic approach. Multiple transactions\nare allowed to execute concurrently. On completion, each transaction is\nvalidated and if any inconsistency is observed it is aborted. Otherwise it is\nallowed to commit.\n  In databases a class of histories called as conflict-serializability (CSR)\nbased on the notion of conflicts have been identified, whose membership can be\nefficiently verified. As a result, CSR is the commonly used correctness\ncriterion in databases. Similarly, using the notion of conflicts, a correctness\ncriterion, conflict-opacity (co-opacity) which is a sub-class of can be\ndesigned whose membership can be verified in polynomial time. Using the\nverification mechanism, an efficient STM implementation can be designed that is\npermissive w.r.t co-opacity.\n  By storing multiple versions for each transaction object, multi-version STMs\nprovide more concurrency than single-version STMs. But the main drawback of\nco-opacity is that it does not admit histories that are uses multiple versions.\nThis has motivated us to develop a new conflict notions for multi-version STMs.\nIn this paper, we present a new conflict notion multi-version conflict.
