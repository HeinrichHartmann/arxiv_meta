Indeed, the evolution of rotation\nand activity among these stars appears to be so deterministic that their\nrotation/activity diagnostics are often utilized as estimators of stellar age.\nA primary motivation for the recent interest in improving the ages of\nsolar-type field dwarfs is in understanding the evolution of debris disks and\nplanetary systems. Reliable isochronal age-dating for field, solar-type main\nsequence stars is very difficult given the observational uncertainties and\nmulti-Gyr timescales for significant structural evolution. Observationally,\nsignificant databases of activity/rotation diagnostics exist for field\nsolar-type field dwarfs (mainly from chromospheric and X-ray activity surveys).\nBut how well can we empirically age-date solar-type field stars using\nactivity/rotation diagnostics? Here I summarize some recent results for F7-K2\ndwarfs from an analysis by Mamajek & Hillenbrand (2008), including an improved\n\"gyrochronology\" [Period(color, age)] calibration, improved chromospheric\n(R'_HK and X-ray (log Lx/Lbol) activity vs. rotation (via Rossby number)\nrelations, and a chromospheric vs. X-ray activity relation that spans four\norders of magnitude in log Lx/Lbol.

While the line polarisation is positive (negative)\nfor an oblate (prolate) morphology at the peak and in the red wing, the\ncontinuum polarisation may be of any sign. These complex polarisation\nvariations are produced not just by the asymmetric distribution of scatterers\nbut also of the flux. Our early-time signatures are in contradiction with\npredictions for a centrally illuminated aspherical nebula, although this\nbecomes a better approximation at nebular times. For a fixed asymmetry, our\nsynthetic continuum polarisation is generally low, may evolve non-monotonically\nduring the plateau phase, but it systematically rises as the ejecta become\noptically thin. Changes in polarization over time do not necessarily imply a\nchange in the asymmetry of the ejecta. The SN structure (e.g.,\ndensity/ionization) critically influences the level of polarisation.\nImportantly, a low polarisation (<0.5%) at early times does not necessarily\nimply a low degree of asymmetry as usually assumed.

Our work is based on a compositional analysis of the 10 and 20\nmicron silicate emission features for brown dwarfs in the Taurus-Auriga\nstar-forming region. A fundamental finding of our work is that brown dwarfs\nexhibit stronger signs of dust processing in the cold component of the disk,\ncompared to the higher mass T Tauri stars in Taurus. For nearly all of our\ntargets, we find a flat disk structure, which is consistent with the stronger\nsigns of dust processing observed in these disks.

Simple large-scale\nradial mixing cannot account for this gradient in the dust chemical\ncomposition, and some local crystalline formation mechanism may be effective in\nthis disk. The relatively high abundance of crystalline silicates in the outer\ncold regions of brown dwarf disks provides an interesting analogy to comets.

It was previously\nbelieved that the surface of an ETI must be gapless unless one of these\nsymmetries is broken. A well-known symmetry-preserving, gapless surface\ntermination of an ETI supports an odd number of Dirac cones. In this paper we\ndeduce a symmetry-respecting, gapped surface termination of an ETI, which\ncarries an intrinsic 2d topological order, Moore-Read x anti-semion. The\nMoore-Read sector supports non-Abelian charge 1/4 anyons, while the Abelian,\nanti-semion sector is electrically neutral. Time-reversal symmetry is\nimplemented in this surface phase in a highly non-trivial way. Moreover, it is\nimpossible to realize this phase strictly in 2d, simultaneously preserving its\nimplementation of both the particle number and time-reversal symmetries. A 1d\nedge on the ETI surface between the topologically-ordered phase and the\ntopologically trivial time-reversal-broken phase with a Hall conductivity\nsigma_H = 1/2, carries a right-moving neutral Majorana mode, a right-moving\nbosonic charge mode and a left-moving bosonic neutral mode. The\ntopologically-ordered phase is separated from the surface superconductor by a\ndirect second order phase transition in the XY* universality class, which is\ndriven by the condensation of a charge 1/2 boson, when approached from the\ntopologically-ordered side, and proliferation of a flux 4\\pi-vortex, when\napproached from the superconducting side.

The comparison of our broadband near-UV/optical photometry with\nsimple stellar population models yields ages below ~4x10^6 yr and stellar\nmasses from a few thousand up to ~3x10^4 Msun, slightly dependent on the\nassumption of cluster metallicity and IMF.

For each individual task model, researchers tend to develop\ndifferent types of techniques for deriving schedulability tests with different\ncomputation complexity and performance. In this paper, we present a general\nschedulability analysis framework, namely the k2U framework, that can be\npotentially applied to analyze a large set of real-time task models under any\nfixed-priority scheduling algorithm, on both uniprocessor and multiprocessor\nscheduling. The key to k2U is a k-point effective schedulability test, which\ncan be viewed as a \"blackbox\" interface. For any task model, if a corresponding\nk-point effective schedulability test can be constructed, then a sufficient\nutilization-based test can be automatically derived. We show the generality of\nk2U by applying it to different task models, which results in new and improved\ntests compared to the state-of-the-art.\n  Analogously, a similar concept by testing only k points with a different\nformulation has been studied by us in another framework, called k2Q, which\nprovides quadratic bounds or utilization bounds based on a different\nformulation of schedulability test. With the quadratic and hyperbolic forms,\nk2Q and k2U frameworks can be used to provide many quantitive features to be\nmeasured, like the total utilization bounds, speed-up factors, etc., not only\nfor uniprocessor scheduling but also for multiprocessor scheduling.

However, comparing the predictions of planet-disk\ninteraction models to the observed features has shown far from perfect\nagreement. This may be due to the strong approximations used for the\npredictions. For example, spiral arm fitting typically uses results that are\nbased on low-mass planets in an isothermal gas. In this work, we describe\ntwo-dimensional, global, hydrodynamical simulations of disks with embedded\nprotoplanets, with and without the assumption of local isothermality, for a\nrange of planet-to-star mass ratios 1-10 M_jup for a 1 M_sun star.

These drive sustained\nturbulence throughout the disk when they occur. The strength of this effect\ndepends strongly on the mass of the planet and the thermal relaxation\ntimescale; for a 10 M_jup planet embedded in a thin, purely adiabatic disk, the\nspirals, gaps, and vortices typically associated with planet-disk interactions\nare disrupted.

In this paper we present the results of the\nanalysis of HST COS far-UV spectroscopy plus ancillary multi-waveband data of a\nsample of 22 low-redshift galaxies that are good analogs to typical\nstar-forming galaxies at high-redshift.

The evolutionary implications of\nthis new population could be twofold. Either gapped flat disks form a separate\npopulation of evolved disks, or some of them may further evolve into flaring\ndisks with large gaps.

Regions are selected based\non their pre-flare configurations along with the appearance and observational\ncoverage of flare ribbons, and the model is constrained using pre-flare\nfeatures observed in extreme ultraviolet and X-ray passbands. We perform a\ntopology analysis of the models by computing the squashing factor, Q, in order\nto determine the locations of prominent quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs). QSLs\nfrom these maps are compared to flare ribbons at their full extents. We show\nthat in all cases the straight segments of the two J-shaped ribbons are matched\nvery well by the flux-rope-related QSLs, and the matches to the hooked segments\nare less consistent but still good for most cases. In addition, we show that\nthese QSLs overlay ridges in the electric current density maps. This study is\nthe largest sample of regions with QSLs derived from 3D coronal magnetic field\nmodels, and it shows that the magnetofrictional modeling technique that we\nemploy gives a very good representation of flaring regions, with the power to\npredict flare ribbon locations in the event of a flare following the time of\nthe model.\n"]}]

The first question we pose is \"what is special about\nthe class of variables that VSIDS chooses to additively bump?\" In answering\nthis question we showed that VSIDS overwhelmingly picks, bumps, and learns\nbridge variables, defined as the variables that connect distinct communities in\nthe community structure of SAT instances. This is surprising since VSIDS was\ninvented more than a decade before the link between community structure and SAT\nsolver performance was discovered. Additionally, we show that VSIDS viewed as a\nranking function correlates strongly with temporal graph centrality measures.\nPutting these two findings together, we conclude that VSIDS picks\nhigh-centrality bridge variables. The second question we pose is \"what role\ndoes multiplicative decay play in making VSIDS so effective?\" We show that the\nmultiplicative decay behaves like an exponential moving average (EMA) that\nfavors variables that persistently occur in conflicts (the signal) over\nvariables that occur intermittently (the noise).

This\ninteraction can be considered as a game between three players: a cloud\ndefender/administrator, an attacker, and a device. We use traditional signaling\ngames to model the interaction between the cloud and the device, and we use the\nrecently proposed FlipIt game to model the struggle between the defender and\nattacker for control of the cloud. Because attacks upon the cloud can occur\nwithout knowledge of the defender, we assume that strategies in both games are\npicked according to prior commitment. This framework requires a new equilibrium\nconcept, which we call Gestalt Equilibrium, a fixed-point that expresses the\ninterdependence of the signaling and FlipIt games. We present the solution to\nthis fixed-point problem under certain parameter cases, and illustrate an\nexample application of cloud control of an unmanned vehicle. Our results\ncontribute to the growing understanding of cloud-controlled systems.\n","Comment: To be presented at the 2015 Conference on Decision and Game Theory\n  for Security (GameSec 2015)"]}]

When a transition occurs from the lower branch to the upper branch (or\nfrom the upper branch to the lower branch), the surface density rapidly\nincreases (decreases) around that transition region, which induces locally\nenhanced mass flow (referred to as non-steady mass flow) into (out of) that\nregion.

However, the non-steady mass flow\nis not strong enough to induce coherent transition over the whole disk, unless\nthe mass injection rate varies with time. When the injection rate continuously\nchanges, the neutrino luminosity varies intermittently, thus producing\nstep-function-like light curves, as the radiation efficiency discontinuously\nchanges every time the local transition occurs.

We use three recently published M33 catalogs of cluster optical\nbroad-band photometry in standard $UBVRI$ and in CFHT/MegaCam $u^{*}g'r'i'z'$\nphotometric systems.

The derived differential age distribution of the M33 cluster\npopulation is composed of a two-slope profile indicating that the number of\nclusters decreases when age gets older. The first slope is interpreted as the\nevolutionary fading phase of the cluster magnitudes, and the second slope as\nthe cluster disruption.

Populations D and E\ncoincide with the helium-enhanced populations in the middle and the blue main\nsequences (mMS and bMS) previously discovered by Piotto et al.; populations A,\nB, and C correspond to the redder main sequence (rMS) that in the Piotto et al.\nwas associated with the primordial stellar population. Our analysis shows that,\nin the outermost regions probed (between about 1.5 and 2 times the cluster\nhalf-light radius), the velocity distribution of populations D and E is\nradially anisotropic (the deviation from an isotropic distribution is\nsignificant at the ~3.5-sigma level). Stars of populations D and E have a\nsmaller tangential velocity dispersion than those of populations A, B, and C,\nwhile no significant differences are found in the radial-velocity dispersion.\nWe present the results of a numerical simulation showing that the observed\ndifferences between the kinematics of these stellar populations are consistent\nwith the expected kinematic fingerprint of the diffusion towards the cluster\nouter regions of stellar populations initially more centrally concentrated.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure, accepted for publication in ApJ Letters"]}]

While transit photometry\nand Doppler spectroscopy are used to measure the radii and masses respectively\nof planets relative to those of their host star, estimates for the true values\nof these quantities rely on theoretical models of the host star which are known\nto suffer from systematic differences with observations. When a system is\ncomposed of more than two bodies, extra information is contained in the transit\nphotometry and radial velocity data. Velocity information (finite\nspeed-of-light, Doppler) is needed to break the Newtonian $MR^{-3}$ degeneracy.\nWe performed a photodynamical modelling of the two-planet transiting system\nKepler-117 using all photometric and spectroscopic data available. We\ndemonstrate how absolute masses and radii of single-star planetary systems can\nbe obtained without resorting to stellar models.

Our theory is based on the tensile blob picture of Pincus in which the\nfront of the tensile force propagates through the backbone of the polymer, as\nsuggested by Sakaue and recently applied to study a completely flexible polymer\nwith self-avoidance, by Dubbledam et al. For a semi-flexible polymer with a\npersistence length P , its statistics is self-avoiding for a very long chain.\nAs the local force increases, the blob size starts to decrease. At the blob\nsize P/a^2 , where a is the size of a monomer, the statistics becomes that of\nan ideal chain. As the blob size further decreases to below the persistence\nlength P, the statistics is that of a rigid rod. We argue that semi-flexible\npolymer in translocation should include the three regions: a self-avoiding\nregion, an ideal chain region and a rigid rod region, under uneven tension\npropagation, instead of a uniform scaling picture as in the case of a\ncompletely flexible polymer. In various regimes under the effect of weak,\nintermediate and strong driving forces we derive equations from which we can\ncalculate the translocation time of the polymer. The translocation exponent is\ngiven by \\alpha=1+\\mu, where \\mu is an effective exponent for the end-to-end\ndistance of the semi-flexible polymer, having a value between 1/2 and 3/5,\ndepending on the total contour length of the polymer.

Otherwise it is\nallowed to commit.\n  In databases a class of histories called as conflict-serializability (CSR)\nbased on the notion of conflicts have been identified, whose membership can be\nefficiently verified. As a result, CSR is the commonly used correctness\ncriterion in databases. Similarly, using the notion of conflicts, a correctness\ncriterion, conflict-opacity (co-opacity) which is a sub-class of can be\ndesigned whose membership can be verified in polynomial time. Using the\nverification mechanism, an efficient STM implementation can be designed that is\npermissive w.r.t co-opacity.\n  By storing multiple versions for each transaction object, multi-version STMs\nprovide more concurrency than single-version STMs. But the main drawback of\nco-opacity is that it does not admit histories that are uses multiple versions.\nThis has motivated us to develop a new conflict notions for multi-version STMs.\nIn this paper, we present a new conflict notion multi-version conflict.

In\nparticular, these results are consistent with M87 being a mis-aligned BL-Lac\nobject.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 postscript figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

These spectra cover the wavelength\nrange 1140 - 1606 Angstrom and have a resolution of about 1 Angstrom. The\nnuclear continuum is clearly visible in the spectra. The only strong line that\nis observed is Ly-alpha, which has a velocity width of about 3000 km/sec. There\nis also a marginal detection of C IV 1549. The ratio of Ly-alpha to C IV in the\nnuclear spectrum is at least a factor of 2 higher than in a spectrum taken at a\nposition on the disk about 0.6\" away from the nucleus by Dopita et al. This\nenhancement of Ly-alpha at the nucleus could point to significant differences\nin the properties of the emitting gas and/or the excitation mechanism between\nthe outer and inner disk regions. The strength of the observed Ly-alpha places\nlimits on the properties of the absorbing gas present within M87. For instance,\nif the hydrogen column at the systemic velocity of M87 is greater than about\n10^18 cm^{-2} then it can cover only a small fraction of the line emitting\nregion. Spectra separated by 5 days show a 60% difference in the Ly-alpha flux,\nbut the same continuum level. This could be due to either a displacement\nbetween the aperture positions for the two sets of observations, or it could be\ndue to intrinsic variability of the source. The current observations do not\nstrongly favor either of these alternatives. The observations do show, however,\nthat the Ly-alpha line is a useful tracer of kinematics in the M87 nucleus.\n","Comment: 14 pages + 5 figures. LaTeX uses aaspp4.sty.

Radio, optical, X-ray and\ngamma-ray light curves and spectral indices are calculated for a standard\nparameter set that yields hard GRB spectra during the prompt emission phase.\nBecause no lateral spreading of the blast-wave is assumed, the calculated\ntemporal breaks represent the sharpest breaks possible from collimated outflows\nin a uniform surrounding medium. Absence of SSC hardenings in observed GRB\nX-ray afterglows indicates magnetic field generation toward equipartition as\nthe blast wave evolves. EGRET detections of 100 MeV-GeV photons observed\npromptly and 90 minutes after GRB 940217 are attributed to nonthermal\nsynchrotron radiation and SSC emission from a decelerating blast wave,\nrespectively. The SSC process will produce prompt TeV emission that could be\nobserved from GRBs with redshifts $z \\lesssim 0.1$, provided $\\gamma$-$\\gamma$\nopacity in the source is small. Measurements of the time dependence of the 100\nMeV-GeV spectral indices with the planned {\\it GLAST} mission will chart the\nevolution of the SSC component and test the external shock scenario. Transient\noptical and X-ray emissions from misaligned GRBs are generally much weaker than\non-axis emissions produced by dirty and clean fireballs that would themselves\nnot trigger a GRB detector; thus detection of long wavelength transients not\nassociated with GRBs will not unambiguously demonstrate GRB beaming.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 8 figures, LaTeX, uses aaspp4.sty, epsf.sty, submitted to\n  ApJ"]}]
