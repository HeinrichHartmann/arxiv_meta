The model is treated in Bethe-Guggenheim\napproximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution\nproperties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With\n$h_{11}(r)$, $h_{12}(r)$, and $h_{22}(r)$ the three pair correlation functions\nas functions of the separation $r$ (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and\nsolute, respectively), we find for $r \\geq 2$ lattice steps that\n$h_{22}(r)/h_{12}(r) \\equiv h_{12}(r)/h_{11}(r)$. This illustrates a general\ntheorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite $r$. The three\ncorrelation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation\nlength), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the\ndecay of $h_{22}(r)$ is much greater than that of $h_{12}(r)$, which in turn is\nmuch greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. As a consequence the amplitude of the\ndecay of $h_{22}(r)$ is enormously greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. The\neffective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at\nwhich the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in\nsimilar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial\ncoefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the\nsolvent-mediated part $W(r)$ of the potential of mean force between solutes,\nevaluated at contact, $r=1$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy\nof solvation at fixed pressure, $\\Delta G_p^*$, by $(Z/2) W(1) + \\Delta G_p^*\n\\equiv p v_0$, where $Z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, $p$ the\npressure, and $v_0$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A\nlarge, positive $\\Delta G_p^*$ associated with the low solubility is thus\nreflected in a strong attraction (large negative $W$ at contact), which is the\nmajor contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the\nlow solubility (large positive $\\Delta G_p^*$) is due partly to an unfavorable\nenthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in\nthe hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high\nsolubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures"]}]

We derive constraints by using the available {\\it Planck}\nand BICEP2 datasets showing how $c_T^2$ can be measured, albeit obtaining weak\nconstraints due to the overall poor accuracy of the current BB power spectrum\nmeasurements. The present constraint corresponds to $c_T^2 = 1.30 \\pm 0.79$ and\n$c_T^2< 2.85$ at $95%$ C.L. by assuming a power law primordial tensor power\nspectrum and $c_T^2<2.33$ at $95%$ C.L. if the running of the spectral index is\nallowed. We derive forecasts for the next generation CMB satellites, which we\nfind capable of tightly constraining $c_T^2$ at percent level, comparable with\nbounds from binary pulsar measurements, largely due to the absence of\ndegeneracy with other cosmological parameters.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure.

Planetary companions of a fixed mass induce larger amplitude reflex\nmotions around lower-mass stars, which helps make M dwarfs excellent targets\nfor extra-solar planet searches. State of the art velocimeters with $\\sim$1m/s\nstability can detect very low-mass planets out to the habitable zone of these\nstars. Low-mass, small, planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most known\npotentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars.\n  Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS on the ESO 3.6m\ntelescope at La Silla observatory makes a major contribution to this sample.\n  Methods. We present here dense radial velocity (RV) time series for three M\ndwarfs observed over $\\sim5$ years: GJ 3293 (0.42M$_\\odot$), GJ 3341\n(0.47M$_\\odot$), and GJ 3543 (0.45M$_\\odot$).

We then vet potential orbital signals\nagainst several stellar activity indicators, to disentangle the Keplerian\nvariations induced by planets from the spurious signals which result from\nrotational modulation of stellar surface inhomogeneities and from activity\ncycles.\n  Results. Two Neptune-mass planets - $msin(i)=1.4\\pm0.1$ and\n$1.3\\pm0.1M_{nept}$ - orbit GJ 3293 with periods $P=30.60\\pm0.02$ d and\n$P=123.98\\pm0.38$ d, possibly together with a super-Earth -\n$msin(i)\\sim7.9\\pm1.4M_\\oplus$ - with period $P=48.14\\pm0.12\\;d$.

In most of these systems, despite detailed observational information\nbeing available, the nature and the structure of the emitter are still poorly\nknown.\n  Aims: We investigate the validity of the so-called one-zone approximation for\nthe high-energy emitter in binary systems hosting a massive star. In\nparticular, the case of LS 5039 is considered.\n  Methods: Assuming a point-like emitter at rest, the presence of a nearby\nmassive star, and the observed MeV and GeV fluxes as a reference, a non-thermal\nleptonic model is systematically applied for different locations, magnetic\nfields, and non-radiative losses. This allows us to identify both the emitter\nconfigurations that are most compatible with observations and inconsistencies\nbetween model predictions and the available data.\n  Results: In the case of LS 5039, the best parameter combination is fast\nnon-radiative cooling and a low magnetic field. However, discrepancies appear\nwhen comparing the model results at the MeV and GeV energy ranges with the\nobserved fluxes. Predictions fail when the orbital motion is included in the\nanalysis, because emitters and energy budgets that are too large are required.\nValues of X-ray and TeV fluxes that are too high are predicted in such a case,\nalong half of the orbit.\n  Conclusions: We show that the radiation in LS 5039 does not come from only\none electron population, and the emitter is likely extended and inhomogeneous\nwith a low magnetic field.

The INIE are\ntreated using generalized Ohm's law, i.e., we consider the Hall term and the\nambipolar diffusion in the induction equation. The interaction between the\ndifferent species affects the modeled atmosphere as follows: 1) the ambipolar\ndiffusion dissipates magnetic energy and increases the minimum temperature in\nthe chromosphere; 2) the upper chromosphere may get heated and expanded over a\ngreater range of heights. These processes reveal appreciable differences\nbetween the modeled atmospheres of simulations with and without INIE.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures, accepted to be published in Royal Society"]}]

If information transmission is assumed to proceed in a feedforward\ncascade, the receptive field may be interpreted as the external stimulus'\nprofile maximizing neuronal output. The nervous system, however, contains many\nfeedback loops, and sensory neurons filter more currents than the ones\nrepresenting the transduced external stimulus. Some of the additional currents\nare generated by the output activity of the neuron itself, and therefore\nconstitute feedback signals. By means of a time-frequency analysis of the\ninput/output transformation, here we show how feedback modifies the receptive\nfield. The model is applicable to various types of feedback processes, from\nspike triggered intrinsic conductances to inhibitory synaptic inputs from\nnearby neurons. We distinguish between the intrinsic receptive field (filtering\nall input currents) and the effective receptive field (filtering only external\nstimuli). Whereas the intrinsic receptive field summarizes the biophysical\nproperties of the neuron associated to subthreshold integration and spike\ngeneration, only the effective receptive field can be interpreted as the\nexternal stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. We demonstrate that\nspike-triggered feedback shifts low-pass filtering towards band-pass\nprocessing, transforming integrator neurons into resonators.
