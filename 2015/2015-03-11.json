The model is treated in Bethe-Guggenheim\napproximation, which is exact on a Bethe lattice (Cayley tree). The solution\nproperties are obtained in the limit of infinite dilution of the solute. With\n$h_{11}(r)$, $h_{12}(r)$, and $h_{22}(r)$ the three pair correlation functions\nas functions of the separation $r$ (subscripts 1 and 2 referring to solvent and\nsolute, respectively), we find for $r \\geq 2$ lattice steps that\n$h_{22}(r)/h_{12}(r) \\equiv h_{12}(r)/h_{11}(r)$. This illustrates a general\ntheorem that holds in the asymptotic limit of infinite $r$. The three\ncorrelation functions share a common exponential decay length (correlation\nlength), but when the solubility of the solute is low the amplitude of the\ndecay of $h_{22}(r)$ is much greater than that of $h_{12}(r)$, which in turn is\nmuch greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. As a consequence the amplitude of the\ndecay of $h_{22}(r)$ is enormously greater than that of $h_{11}(r)$. The\neffective solute-solute attraction then remains discernible at distances at\nwhich the solvent molecules are essentially no longer correlated, as found in\nsimilar circumstances in an earlier model. The second osmotic virial\ncoefficient is large and negative, as expected. We find that the\nsolvent-mediated part $W(r)$ of the potential of mean force between solutes,\nevaluated at contact, $r=1$, is related in this model to the Gibbs free energy\nof solvation at fixed pressure, $\\Delta G_p^*$, by $(Z/2) W(1) + \\Delta G_p^*\n\\equiv p v_0$, where $Z$ is the coordination number of the lattice, $p$ the\npressure, and $v_0$ the volume of the cell associated with each lattice site. A\nlarge, positive $\\Delta G_p^*$ associated with the low solubility is thus\nreflected in a strong attraction (large negative $W$ at contact), which is the\nmajor contributor to the second osmotic virial coefficient. In this model, the\nlow solubility (large positive $\\Delta G_p^*$) is due partly to an unfavorable\nenthalpy of solvation and partly to an unfavorable solvation entropy, unlike in\nthe hydrophobic effect, where the enthalpy of solvation itself favors high\nsolubility, but is overweighed by the unfavorable solvation entropy.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 2 figures"]}]

A wide variety\nof change timings are detected such as dust deposited and then cleaned over a\nMartian year, areas modified only during successive global dust storms, and\nperennial changes over decades. Both similarities and differences with previous\nglobal dust storms are observed.

Planetary companions of a fixed mass induce larger amplitude reflex\nmotions around lower-mass stars, which helps make M dwarfs excellent targets\nfor extra-solar planet searches.

Low-mass, small, planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most known\npotentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars.\n  Aims.

In most of these systems, despite detailed observational information\nbeing available, the nature and the structure of the emitter are still poorly\nknown.\n  Aims: We investigate the validity of the so-called one-zone approximation for\nthe high-energy emitter in binary systems hosting a massive star. In\nparticular, the case of LS 5039 is considered.\n  Methods: Assuming a point-like emitter at rest, the presence of a nearby\nmassive star, and the observed MeV and GeV fluxes as a reference, a non-thermal\nleptonic model is systematically applied for different locations, magnetic\nfields, and non-radiative losses. This allows us to identify both the emitter\nconfigurations that are most compatible with observations and inconsistencies\nbetween model predictions and the available data.\n  Results: In the case of LS 5039, the best parameter combination is fast\nnon-radiative cooling and a low magnetic field. However, discrepancies appear\nwhen comparing the model results at the MeV and GeV energy ranges with the\nobserved fluxes. Predictions fail when the orbital motion is included in the\nanalysis, because emitters and energy budgets that are too large are required.\nValues of X-ray and TeV fluxes that are too high are predicted in such a case,\nalong half of the orbit.\n  Conclusions: We show that the radiation in LS 5039 does not come from only\none electron population, and the emitter is likely extended and inhomogeneous\nwith a low magnetic field.

Assuming that particles are accelerated in the standing shock\ngenerated in the jet as it impacts the red giant wind, we compute the\nnon-thermal particle distribution, the Doppler boosting enhancement, and the\nnon-thermal luminosity in gamma rays. The available non-thermal energy from\njet-obstacle interactions is potentially enhanced by a factor of $\\sim 100$\nwhen accounting for the whole surface of the shock induced by the obstacle,\ninstead of just the obstacle section. The observer gamma-ray luminosity,\nincluding the flow velocity and Doppler boosting effects, can be ~300(g/10)^2\ntimes higher than when the emitting flow is assumed at rest and only the\nobstacle section is considered, where g is the jet Lorentz factor. For a whole\npopulation of red giants inside the jet of an AGN, the predicted persistent\ngamma-ray luminosities may be potentially detectable for a jet pointing to the\nobserver. Obstacles interacting with relativistic outflows, for instance clouds\nand populations of stars for extragalactic jets, or stellar wind\ninhomogeneities in microquasar jets and in winds of pulsars in binaries, should\nbe taken into account when investigating the non-thermal emission from these\nsources.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, version after proofs to appear in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

Field\nline helicity offers further advantages because it preserves all topological\ninformation and can distinguish between different magnetic fields with the same\ntotal helicity.

We review the\nrelevance and the role of the partial ionization in the chromosphere and show\nthat this process actually impacts considerably the outer solar atmosphere. We\ninclude analysis of our 2.5D radiative MHD simulations with the Bifrost code\n(Gudiksen et al. 2011) including the partial ionization effects on the\nchromosphere and corona and thermal conduction along magnetic field lines. The\nphotosphere, chromosphere and transition region are partially ionized and the\ninteraction between ionized particles and neutral particles has important\nconsequences on the magneto-thermodynamics of these layers. The INIE are\ntreated using generalized Ohm's law, i.e., we consider the Hall term and the\nambipolar diffusion in the induction equation. The interaction between the\ndifferent species affects the modeled atmosphere as follows: 1) the ambipolar\ndiffusion dissipates magnetic energy and increases the minimum temperature in\nthe chromosphere; 2) the upper chromosphere may get heated and expanded over a\ngreater range of heights. These processes reveal appreciable differences\nbetween the modeled atmospheres of simulations with and without INIE.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures, accepted to be published in Royal Society"]}]

If information transmission is assumed to proceed in a feedforward\ncascade, the receptive field may be interpreted as the external stimulus'\nprofile maximizing neuronal output. The nervous system, however, contains many\nfeedback loops, and sensory neurons filter more currents than the ones\nrepresenting the transduced external stimulus. Some of the additional currents\nare generated by the output activity of the neuron itself, and therefore\nconstitute feedback signals. By means of a time-frequency analysis of the\ninput/output transformation, here we show how feedback modifies the receptive\nfield. The model is applicable to various types of feedback processes, from\nspike triggered intrinsic conductances to inhibitory synaptic inputs from\nnearby neurons. We distinguish between the intrinsic receptive field (filtering\nall input currents) and the effective receptive field (filtering only external\nstimuli). Whereas the intrinsic receptive field summarizes the biophysical\nproperties of the neuron associated to subthreshold integration and spike\ngeneration, only the effective receptive field can be interpreted as the\nexternal stimulus' profile maximizing neuronal output. We demonstrate that\nspike-triggered feedback shifts low-pass filtering towards band-pass\nprocessing, transforming integrator neurons into resonators.
