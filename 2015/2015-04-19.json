By analyzing the directional\ndependence for the Young's modulus, we explore the third principle direction\nwith direction angle phi_tp = 0.268pi besides armchair and zigzag directions.\nThe maximum Young's modulus value is in the third principle direction. More\nspecifically, the Young's modulus is 52.2 N/m, 85.4 N/m, and 111.4 N/m in the\narmchair direction, zigzag direction, and the third principle direction,\nrespectively. This new principle direction is of significance for future\ndiscussions of other anisotropic properties in the single-layer black\nphosphorus.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figs. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1410.3545"]}]
