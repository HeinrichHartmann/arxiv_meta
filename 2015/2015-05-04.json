However, in real\nworld systems, user feedback is continuously generated, at unpredictable rates.\nGiven this setting, one important issue is how to evaluate algorithms in such a\nstreaming data environment. In this paper we propose a prequential evaluation\nprotocol for recommender systems, suitable for streaming data environments, but\nalso applicable in stationary settings. Using this protocol we are able to\nmonitor the evolution of algorithms' accuracy over time. Furthermore, we are\nable to perform reliable comparative assessments of algorithms by computing\nsignificance tests over a sliding window. We argue that besides being suitable\nfor streaming data, prequential evaluation allows the detection of phenomena\nthat would otherwise remain unnoticed in the evaluation of both offline and\nonline recommender systems.\n","Comment: Workshop on 'Recommender Systems Evaluation: Dimensions and Design'\n  (REDD 2014), held in conjunction with RecSys 2014.

Classical asperity theories predict, in agreement\nwith experimental observations, that adhesion is always destroyed by roughness\nexcept if the amplitude of the same is extremely small, and the materials are\nparticularly soft. This happens for all fractal dimensions. However, these\ntheories are limited due to the geometrical simplification, which may be\nparticularly strong in conditions near full contact. We introduce therefore a\nsimple model for adhesion, which aims at being rigorous near full contact,\nwhere we postulate there are only small isolated gaps between the two bodies.\nThe gaps can be considered as \"pressurized cracks\" by using Ken Johnson's idea\nof searching a corrective solution to the full contact solution. The solution\nis an extension of the adhesive-less solution proposed recently by Xu, Jackson,\nand Marghitu (XJM model) (2014). This process seems to confirm recent theories\nusing the JKR theory, namely that the effect of adhesion depends critically on\nthe fractal dimension. For D<2.5, the case which includes the vast majority of\nnatural surfaces, there is an expected strong effect of adhesion. Only for\nlarge fractal dimensions, D>2.5, seems for large enough magnifications that a\nfull fractal roughness completely destroys adhesion. These results are partly\nparadoxical since strong adhesion is not observed in nature except in special\ncases. A possible way out of the paradox may be that the conclusion is relevant\nfor the near full contact regime, where the strong role of flaws at the\ninterfaces, and of gaps full of contaminant, trapped air or liquid in pressure,\nneeds to be further explored. If conditions near full contact are not achieved\non loading, probably the conclusions of classical asperity theories may be\nconfirmed.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Various outer bounds and\npartial results have been proposed. Using a simple chain rule argument we\nidentify nonnegative differences between the functional repair and the exact\nrepair outer bounds. One of the differences is then bounded from below by the\nrepair data of a shortened subcode. Our main result is a new outer bound for an\nexact repair regenerating code in terms of its shortened subcodes. In general\nthe new outer bound is implicit and depends on the choice of shortened\nsubcodes. For the linear case we obtain explicit bounds.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

The deriving\ntransform of a differential category, which models the differentiation\ninference rule, is a derivation in the dual category.

This is a monad $T$ such that each object of the form $TC$ is\ncanonically an associative, commutative algebra. Consequently, every\n$T$-algebra has a canonical commutative algebra structure, and we show that\nuniversal derivations for these algebras can be constructed quite generally.\n  It is a standard result that there is a bijection between derivations from an\nassociative algebra $A$ to an $A$-module $M$ and algebra homomorphisms over $A$\nfrom $A$ to $A\\oplus M$, with $A\\oplus M$ being considered as an infinitesimal\nextension of $A$.
