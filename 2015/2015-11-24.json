With a surprisingly simple\narrangement it is possible to provide the AFM tip with the right counterforce\nto keep it fixed at any time. The counterforce is consequently equal to the\ntip-sample force. The force, force gradient and damping are simultaneously\nmeasured independently of the tip position. This permits the measurement of\nenergy transfer in thermodynamic transformations. Here we show some FFM\nmeasurement examples of the complete interaction force curve and in particular\nthat the FFM can follow the nucleation of a water bridge by measuring the\ncapillary attractive force at all distances, without jump to contact despite\nthe large attractive capillary force. Real time combination of the measured\nparameters will lead to new imaging modalities with chemical contrast in\ndifferent environments.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Especially\nthe measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic\nsurge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two\nprocesses requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes\nto estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these\nobservations, available estimators assume stationarity of processes to allow\npooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle\nto the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes\nare often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues\ntheoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by\nestimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations. Such an ensemble\nis often readily available in neuroscience experiments in the form of\nexperimental trials. Thus, in this work we combine the ensemble method with a\nrecently proposed transfer entropy estimator to make transfer entropy\nestimation applicable to non-stationary time series. We present an efficient\nimplementation of the approach that deals with the increased computational\ndemand of the ensemble method's practical application.

To optimize the\ntuning parameter of the model and validate it, we introduce an objective\nfunction based on survival or prediction-error statistics, such as the log-rank\ntest and the concordance error rate.

We have now established a robust optical\nstatistical distance indicator, the H$\\alpha$ surface brightness- radius or S-r\nrelation, which addresses this problem. We developed this relation from a\ncritically evaluated sample of primary calibrating PNe. The robust nature of\nthe method results from our revised calibrating distances with significantly\nreduced systematic uncertainties, and the recent availability of high-quality\ndata, including updated nebular diameters and integrated H$\\alpha$ fluxes. The\nS-r technique is simple in its application, requiring only an angular size, an\nintegrated H\\alpha\\ flux, and the reddening to the PN. From these quantities,\nan intrinsic radius is calculated, which when combined with the angular size,\nyields the distance directly. Furthermore, we have found that optically thick\nPNe tend to populate the upper bound of the trend, while optically-thin PNe\nfall along the lower boundary in the S-r plane. This enables sub-trends to be\ndeveloped which offer even better precision in the determination of distances,\nas good as 18 per cent in the case of optically-thin, high-excitation PNe. This\nis significantly better than any previous statistical indicator. We use this\ntechnique to create a catalogue of statistical distances for over 1100 Galactic\nPNe, the largest such compilation in the literature to date.

Our study is focused on the amplitude of modulation of\nturbulence.

The modulus of this order parameter models the\namplitude of modulation of turbulence. Firstly, we compute the autocorrelation\nfunction of said modulus once the band is established.

We then perform numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes\nequations in order to confront these predictions with the actual behaviour of\nthe bands. Computation of the autocorrelation function of the modulation of\nturbulence shows quantitative agreement with the model: in the established band\nregime, the amplitude of modulation follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. In\norder to test the S3T predictions, we perform quench experiments, sudden\ndecreases of the Reynolds number from uniform turbulence, in which modulation\nappears.

The average trajectory grows exponentially, at a rate clearly smaller\nthan that of the formation of laminar holes. The actual time evolution remains\nin a flaring envelope, centred on the average, and expanding at the same rate.\nThese results provide further validation of the stochastic modeling for the\ntime evolution of the bands for further studies.

This paper investigates the\nenergy-aware virtual machine (VM) allocation problems in IaaS clouds along\ncharacteristics: multiple resources, and fixed interval times and\nnon-preemption of virtual machines. Many previous works proposed to use a\nminimum number of physical machines, however, this is not necessarily a good\nsolution to minimize total energy consumption in the VM placement with multiple\nresources, fixed interval times and non-preemption. We observed that minimizing\ntotal energy consumption of physical machines is equivalent to minimize the sum\nof total completion time of all physical machines. Based on the observation, we\npropose EMinRET algorithm. The EMinRET algorithm swaps an allocating VM with a\nsuitable overlapped VM, which is of the same VM type and is allocated on the\nsame physical machine, to minimize total completion time of all physical\nmachines. The EMinRET uses resource utilization during executing time period of\na physical machine as the evaluation metric, and will then choose a host that\nminimizes the metric to allocate a new VM.

RDMD is applied to transient cylinder wake data and is benchmarked\nagainst POD and optimized DMD (Chen et al. 2012) for the same snapshot\nsequence. Unlike POD modes, RDMD structures are shown to have pure frequency\ncontent while retaining a residual of comparable order as POD. In contrast to\nDMD with exponentially growing or decaying oscillatory amplitudes, RDMD clearly\nidentifies initial, maximum and final fluctuation levels. Intriguingly, RDMD\noutperforms both POD and DMD in the limit cycle resolution from the same\nsnaphots. RDMD is proposed as an attractive alternative to POD and DMD for\nempirical Galerkin models, with nonlinear transient dynamics as a niche\napplication.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 10 figures, 1 table"]}]

In\npractice however, most evaluation scenarios only allow us to conclusively\ndetermine the relevance towards the particular assessor that provided the\njudgments. A factor that cannot be ignored when extending conclusions made from\nassessors towards users, is the possible disagreement on relevance, assuming\nthat a single gold truth label does not exist. This paper presents and analyzes\nthe Predicted Relevance Model (PRM), which allows predicting a particular\nresult's relevance for a random user, based on an observed assessment and\nknowledge on the average disagreement between assessors. With the PRM, existing\nevaluation metrics designed to measure binary assessor relevance, can be\ntransformed into more robust and effectively graded measures that evaluate\nrelevance towards a random user. It also leads to a principled way of\nquantifying multiple graded or categorical relevance levels for use as gains in\nestablished graded relevance measures, such as normalized discounted cumulative\ngain (nDCG), which nowadays often use heuristic and data-independent gain\nvalues. Given a set of test topics with graded relevance judgments, the PRM\nallows evaluating systems on different scenarios, such as their capability of\nretrieving top results, or how well they are able to filter out non-relevant\nones.

Firstly, both for the Yang-Mills\naction and the Born-Infeld action it is shown that these configurations are\nindeed BPS, i.e. solutions to these equations saturate a Bogomolny bound and\nleave some supersymmetry unbroken. Next, we use the BPS equations as a tool to\nconstruct the D-brane effective action and require that (a deformation of)\nthese equations should still imply the equations of motion in more general\ncases. In the abelian case we managed to calculate all order in $\\alpha'$\nfour-derivative corrections to the effective action and the BPS equations while\nin the non-abelian case we obtained the effective action up to order\n$\\alpha'^4$. Furthermore, we discuss a check based on the spectrum of strings\nstretching between intersecting branes. Finally, this Ph.D. thesis also\ndiscusses the construction of a boundary superspace which is the first step to\nuse the method of Weyl invariance in N=2 superspace in order to again construct\nthe D-brane effective action.
