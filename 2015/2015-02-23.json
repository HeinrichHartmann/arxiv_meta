The main thrust of this study is to see the effect of\nhadronic interaction models on the production pattern of Cherenkov photons with\nrespect to distance from the shower core. Such studies are very important in\nground based $\\gamma$-ray astronomy for an effective rejection of huge cosmic\nray background, where the atmospheric Cherenkov technique is being used\nextensively within the energy range of some hundred GeV to few TeV. We have\nfound that for all primary particles, the density distribution patterns of\nCherenkov photons follow the negative exponential function with different\ncoefficients and slopes depending on the type of primary particle, its energy\nand the type of interaction model combinations. Whereas the arrival time\ndistribution patterns of Cherenkov photons follow the function of the form $t\n(r) = t_{0}e^{\\Gamma/r^{\\lambda}}$, with different values of the function\nparameters. There is no significant effect of hadronic interaction model\ncombinations on the density and arrival time distributions for the $\\gamma$-ray\nprimaries. However, for the hadronic showers, the effects of the model\ncombinations are significant under different conditions.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures in Published in Astroparticle Physics, 2015"]}]

This agree with DFT calculations\nthat predict sudden jumps in some observables as the molecule breaks. According\nto our model this phenomenon emerges because the catalyst provides for a non-\nHermitian Hamiltonian. We show that when the molecule approaches the surface,\nas occurs in the Heyrovsky reaction of H 2, the bonding H 2 orbital has a\nsmooth crossover into a bonding molecular orbital built with the closest H\norbital and the surface metal d-states. The same occurs for the antibonding\nstate. Meanwhile, two resonances appear within the continuous spectrum of the\nd- band which are associated with bonding and antibonding orbitals between the\nfurthest H atom and the d-states at the second metallic layer. These move\ntowards the band center where they collapse into a pure metallic resonance and\nan almost isolated H orbital. This phenomenon constitutes a striking example of\nthe non-trivial physics enabled when one deals with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian\nbeyond the usual wide band approximation.\n"]}]

In this paper we consider three classic algorithms under limited\nindependence. We provide new bounds for randomized quicksort, min-wise hashing\nand largest bucket size under limited independence. Our results can be\nsummarized as follows.\n  -Randomized quicksort. When pivot elements are computed using a\n$5$-independent hash function, Karloff and Raghavan, J.ACM'93 showed $O ( n\n\\log n)$ expected worst-case running time for a special version of quicksort.\nWe improve upon this, showing that the same running time is achieved with only\n$4$-independence.\n  -Min-wise hashing. For a set $A$, consider the probability of a particular\nelement being mapped to the smallest hash value. It is known that\n$5$-independence implies the optimal probability $O (1 /n)$. Broder et al.,\nSTOC'98 showed that $2$-independence implies it is $O(1 / \\sqrt{|A|})$. We show\na matching lower bound as well as new tight bounds for $3$- and $4$-independent\nhash functions.\n  -Largest bucket. We consider the case where $n$ balls are distributed to $n$\nbuckets using a $k$-independent hash function and analyze the largest bucket\nsize. Alon et. al, STOC'97 showed that there exists a $2$-independent hash\nfunction implying a bucket of size $\\Omega ( n^{1/2})$. We generalize the\nbound, providing a $k$-independent family of functions that imply size $\\Omega\n( n^{1/k})$.\n","Comment: Submitted to ICALP 2015"]}]
