As a consequence of (ii) and (iii), Fulcrum\ncodes have a unique trait missing so far in the network coding literature: they\nprovide the network with the flexibility to spread computational complexity\nover different devices depending on their current load, network conditions, or\neven energy targets in a decentralized way. At the core of our framework lies\nthe idea of precoding at the sources using an expansion field GF(2h) to\nincrease the number of dimensions seen by the network using a linear mapping.\nFulcrum codes can use any high-field linear code for precoding, e.g.,\nReed-Solomon, with the structure of the precode determining some of the key\nfeatures of the resulting code. For example, a systematic structure provides\nthe ability to manage heterogeneous receivers while using the same data stream.\nOur analysis shows that the number of additional dimensions created during\nprecoding controls the trade-off between delay, overhead, and complexity. Our\nimplementation and measurements show that Fulcrum achieves similar decoding\nprobability as high field Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) approaches but\nwith encoders/decoders that are an order of magnitude faster.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 12 figures, Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on\n  Communications"]}]

However, bright galaxies\nat z=4-7 are less massive and have younger inferred ages than similarly bright\ngalaxies at z=2-3, even though the two populations have similar star formation\nrates and levels of dust attenuation. We match the abundances of these bright\nz=4-7 galaxies to halo mass functions from the Bolshoi Lambda-CDM simulation to\nestimate the halo masses.

Tiling for cache is typically\nguided by capacity miss counts. Models of cache function have not been\neffectively used to guide cache tiling optimizations due to model error and\nexpense. Instead, heuristic or empirical approaches are used to select tilings.\nWe argue that conflict misses, traditionally neglected or seen as a small\nconstant effect, are the only fundamentally important cache miss category, that\nthey form a solid basis by which caches can become modellable, and that models\nleaning on cache associatvity analysis can be used to generate cache performant\ntilings.

We show\nthese lattices to possess two theoretical advantages over rectangular tiles --\nvolume maximization and miss regularity. We also show that to generate such\nlattice tiles requires, unlike rectangular tiling, no explicit, expensive\nlattice point counting. We also describe an implementation of our lattice\ntiling approach, show that it can be used to give speedups of over 10x versus\nunoptimized code, and despite currently only tiling for one level of cache, can\nalready be competitive with the aggressive compiler optimizations used in\ngeneral purposes compares such as GCC and Intel's ICC.

The best known upper bound for the size of such a\nparser is $O(2^{|G||\\Sigma|^k+k\\log |\\Sigma| + \\log |G|})$ where $|G|$ and\n$|\\Sigma|$ are the sizes of the grammar $G$ and the terminal alphabet $\\Sigma$,\nrespectively. If we add to a parser the possibility to manipulate a directed\ngraph of size $O(|G|n)$ where $n$ is the length of the input then we obtain an\nextended parser. The graph is used for an efficient parallel simulation of all\npotential leftmost derivations of the current right sentential form such that\nthe unique rightmost derivation of the input can be computed. Given an\narbitrary $LR(k)$-grammar $G$, we show how to construct an extended parser of\n$O(|G| + \\#LA |N|2^k k \\log k)$ size where $|N|$ is the number of nonterminal\nsymbols and $\\#LA$ is the number of relevant lookaheads with respect to the\ngrammar $G$.

Using some ingenious data structures and increasing the parsing time\nby a small constant factor, the size of the extended parser can be reduced to\n$O(|G| + \\#LA|N|k^2)$. The parsing time is $O(ld(input) + k|G|n)$ where\n$ld(input)$ is the length of the derivation of the input.

The turbulent flow contains much more energy than the\nsurface waves. In order to focus on the surface wave, the deformations induced\nby the turbulent flow are removed. This is done by performing a coherent phase\naveraging. For wavelengths smaller than the forcing lengthscale, we observe a\nsignificant increase of the wavelength of the propagating wave that has not\nbeen reported before.

The local measurements of the wave frequency far from the\nwavemaker do not reveal such systematic behavior, although a small shift is\nmeasured.

Most of\nthem propose a damping that increases as the square of Froude number. In\ncontrast, our experimental results show a turbulent damping increasing linearly\nwith the Froude number. We interpret this linear behaviour as a balance between\nthe time spent by a wave to cross a turbulent structure with the turbulent\nmixing time.

This paper proposes to\ncombine the traditional feature-based method, the convolutional and recurrent\nneural networks to simultaneously benefit from their advantages. Our systematic\nevaluation of different network architectures and combination methods\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of this approach and results in the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ACE 2005 and SemEval dataset.\n"]}]

Here, we investigate the\nevaporation-driven assembly of quantum dots inside a confined cylindrical\ngeometry.

However, its convergence rate is\nknown to be slow (sublinear) when the solution lies at the boundary. A simple\nless-known fix is to add the possibility to take 'away steps' during\noptimization, an operation that importantly does not require a feasibility\noracle. In this paper, we highlight and clarify several variants of the\nFrank-Wolfe optimization algorithm that have been successfully applied in\npractice: away-steps FW, pairwise FW, fully-corrective FW and Wolfe's minimum\nnorm point algorithm, and prove for the first time that they all enjoy global\nlinear convergence, under a weaker condition than strong convexity of the\nobjective. The constant in the convergence rate has an elegant interpretation\nas the product of the (classical) condition number of the function with a novel\ngeometric quantity that plays the role of a 'condition number' of the\nconstraint set. We provide pointers to where these algorithms have made a\ndifference in practice, in particular with the flow polytope, the marginal\npolytope and the base polytope for submodular optimization.\n","Comment: Appears in: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28\n  (NIPS 2015). 26 pages"]}]
