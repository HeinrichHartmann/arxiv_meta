We\nstudy a certain class of idempotent elements E in the multiplier algebra of the\ntensor product of B with C, called separability idempotents. The conditions\ninclude the existence of non-degenerate anti-homomorphisms from B to M(C) and\nfrom C to M(B), the multiplier algebras of C and B respectively. They are\ncalled the antipodal maps. There also exist what we call distinguished linear\nfunctionals. They are unique and faithful in the regular case. The notion is\nmore restrictive than what is generally considered in the case of\n(finite-dimensional) algebras with identity. The separability idempotents we\nconsider in this paper are of a Frobenius type. It seems to be quite natural to\nconsider this type of separability idempotents in the case of non-degenerate\nalgebras possibly without an identity. One example is coming from a discrete\nquantum group A. Here we take B=C=A and E is the image under the coproduct of\nh, where h is the normalized cointegral. The antipodal maps coincide with the\noriginal antipode and the distinguished linear functionals are the integrals.\nAnother example is obtained from a weak multiplier Hopf algebra A. Now B and C\nare the images of the source and target maps. For E we take the canonical\nidempotent. Again the antipodal maps come from the antipode of the weak\nmultiplier Hopf algebra. These two examples have motivated the study of\nseparability idempotents as used in this paper. We use the separability\nidempotent to study modules over the base algebras B and C. In the regular\ncase, we obtain a structure theorem for these algebras.\n"]}]

The resonant parametric instability is a well-known\nform of three-wave interaction in which a primary wave of frequency $\\omega_a$\nexcites a pair of secondary waves of frequency $\\omega_b+\\omega_c \\simeq\n\\omega_a$. Here we consider a nonresonant form of three-wave interaction in\nwhich a low-frequency primary wave excites a high-frequency p-mode and a\nlow-frequency g-mode such that $\\omega_b+\\omega_c >>\\omega_a$. We show that a\np-mode can couple so strongly to a g-mode of similar radial wavelength that\nthis type of interaction is unstable even if the primary wave amplitude is\nsmall. As an application, we analyze the stability of the tide in coalescing\nneutron star binaries to p-g mode coupling. We find that the equilibrium tide\nand dynamical tide are both p-g unstable at gravitational wave frequencies\nf_{gw} > 20 Hz and drive p-g pairs to significant energies on very short\ntimescales (much less than the orbital decay time). Resonant parametric\ncoupling to the tide is, by contrast, either stable or drives modes at a much\nsmaller rate. We do not solve for the saturation of the instability and\ntherefore cannot say precisely how it influences neutron star binaries.\nHowever, we show that if even a single daughter mode saturates near its wave\nbreaking amplitude, the p-g instability of the equilibrium tide: (i) induces\nsignificant orbital phase errors ($\\Delta \\phi$ > 1 radian) that accumulate\nprimarily at low frequencies (f_{gw} < 50 Hz) and (ii) heats the neutron star\ncore to T~10^{10} K. Since there are >100 unstable daughters, $\\Delta \\phi$ and\nT are potentially much larger than these values. Tides might therefore\nsignificantly influence the gravitational wave signal and electromagnetic\nemission from neutron star binaries at much larger orbital separations than\npreviously thought.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures, matches version published in ApJ"]}]

We first show\nthat no statistical procedure based on a sample of size $n$ can estimate a\nlog-concave density with respect to the squared Hellinger loss function with\nsupremum risk smaller than order $n^{-4/5}$, when $d=1$, and order\n$n^{-2/(d+1)}$ when $d \\geq 2$. In particular, this reveals a sense in which,\nwhen $d \\geq 3$, log-concave density estimation is fundamentally more\nchallenging than the estimation of a density with two bounded derivatives (a\nproblem to which it has been compared). Second, we show that for $d \\leq 3$,\nthe Hellinger $\\epsilon$-bracketing entropy of a class of log-concave densities\nwith small mean and covariance matrix close to the identity grows like\n$\\max\\{\\epsilon^{-d/2},\\epsilon^{-(d-1)}\\}$ (up to a logarithmic factor when\n$d=2$).

By\nconsidering the appropriate limits, we show that both the\ntransverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) and the high-energy factorization formulas\ncan be derived from the Color Glass Condensate framework. Respectively, this\nhappens when the transverse momentum imbalance of the dijet system, $k_t$, is\nof the order of either the saturation scale, or the hard jet momenta, the\nformer being always much smaller than the latter. We propose a new formula for\nforward dijets that encompasses both situations and is therefore applicable\nregardless of the magnitude of $k_t$. That involves generalizing the TMD\nfactorization formula for dijet production to the case where the incoming\nsmall-$x$ gluon is off-shell. The derivation is performed in two independent\nways, using either Feynman diagram techniques, or color-ordered amplitudes.\n","Comment: The improved version of the manuscript. 37 pages, 8 figures, several\n  tables"]}]

Almost 70\nyears after the first detection of radio emission coming from a SNR, great\nprogress has been achieved in the comprehension of their physical\ncharacteristics and evolution.

The consequences of the interaction\nbetween the SNR shocks and the surrounding medium are examined, including the\nquestion of whether SNRs can trigger the formation of new stars. Cases of\nmultispectral comparison are presented. A section is devoted to reviewing\nrecent results of radio SNRs in the Magellanic Clouds, with particular emphasis\non the radio properties of SN 1987A, an ideal laboratory to investigate\ndynamical evolution of an SNR in near real time.

This is\nformally achieved by the maximum of the expected KL-divergence between the\ndistribution of the successor state conditioned on a specific action and a\ndistribution where the actions are marginalised out. This is a natural\ncandidate for an intrinsic reward signal in the context of reinforcement\nlearning: the agent will place itself in a situation where its action have\nmaximum stability and maximum influence on the future. The limiting factor so\nfar has been the computational complexity of the method: the only way of\ncalculation has so far been a brute force algorithm, reducing the applicability\nof the method to environments with a small set discrete states. In this work,\nwe propose to use an efficient approximation for marginalising out the actions\nin the case of continuous environments. This allows fast evaluation of\nempowerment, paving the way towards challenging environments such as real world\nrobotics. The method is presented on a pendulum swing up problem.\n"]}]
