These fluids naturally show a rich phenomenology exhibiting\nfractionation and shifts in critical point and freezing temperatures. Here, we\nstudy the impact of size polydispersity on the basic nature of Lennard-Jones\n(LJ) liquids, which represent most molecular liquids without hydrogen bonds,\nvia two- and three-dimensional molecular dynamics computer simulations. A\nsingle-component liquid constituting spherical particles and interacting via\nthe LJ potential is known to exhibit strong correlations between virial and\npotential energy equilibrium fluctuations at constant volume. This correlation\nsignificantly simplifies the physical description of the liquid, and these\nliquids are now known as Roskilde-simple (RS) liquids. We show that this simple\nnature of the single-component LJ liquid is preserved even for very high\npolydispersities (above 40% polydispersity for the studied uniform\ndistribution). We also investigate isomorphs of moderately polydisperse LJ\nliquids. Isomorphs are curves in the phase diagram of RS liquids along which\nstructure, dynamics, and some thermodynamic quantities are invariant in\ndimensionless units. We find that isomorphs are a good approximation even for\npolydisperse LJ liquids. The theory of isomorphs thus extends readily to\nmulti-component systems and can be used to improve even further the\nunderstanding of these intriguing systems.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 13 figures"]}]

In the first part we show that superheavy threshold\neffects can drastically lower the SO(10) yukawa couplings required for\nrealistic unification and this cures the long standing problem of fast proton\ndecay in Susy GUT. Then we propose a novel Supersymmetric Seesaw\ninflection(SSI) scenario based upon a SU(2)_L x U(1)_R x U(1)_{B-L} invariant\nmodel, where the inflation mass is controlled by the large conjugate sneutrino\nmass. We show that it is much less fine-tuned and more stable than Dirac\nsneutrino based MSSM inflation. NMSGUT can embed SSI, and even provide a large\ntensor scalar ratio, but obstacles in achieving enough inflation remain. The\nNMSGUT Bino LSP is a good dark matter candidate when it can co-annihilate with\na nearly degenerate sfermion as in fits with a light smuon.

Currently the detector consists of 44 antennas connected to\nair-Cherenkov and scintillator detectors, respectively, placed in the Tunka\nvalley, Siberia. Triggered by these detectors, Tunka-Rex measures the radio\nsignal up to EeV-scale air-showers. This configuration provides a unique\npossibility for cross-calibration between air-Cherenkov, radio and particle\ntechniques. We present reconstruction methods for the energy and the shower\nmaximum developed with CoREAS simulations, which allow for a precision\ncompetitive with the air-Cherenkov technique. We apply these methods to data\nacquired by Tunka-Rex in the first year which we use for cross-calibration, and\nwe compare the results with the reconstruction of the energy and the shower\nmaximum by Tunka-133, which provides also a reconstruction for the shower core\nused for the radio reconstruction. Our methods have shown that the atmospheric\ndepth of the shower maximum ($X_\\mathrm{max}$) can be reconstructed with a\nprecision of better than 40 g/cm$^2$ for high quality events, in some cases\neven when only three antenna stations have signal.

The proposed algorithm combines local and\nmultiscale contextual information with rejection, improving the classification\nperformance. As a probabilistic model for classification, we adopt a\nmultinomial logistic regression. The concept of rejection with contextual\ninformation is implemented by modeling the classification problem as an energy\nminimization problem over a graph representing local and multiscale\nsimilarities of the image. The rejection is introduced through an energy data\nterm associated with the classification risk and the contextual information\nthrough an energy smoothness term associated with the local and multiscale\nsimilarities within the image.

First, the opinionated documents constitute an\nevolving stream, where both the author's attitude and the vocabulary itself may\nchange. Second, labels of documents are scarce and labels of words are\nunreliable, because the sentiment of a word depends on the (unknown) context in\nthe author's mind. Most of the research on mining over opinionated streams\nfocuses on the first aspect of the problem, whereas for the second a continuous\nsupply of labels from the stream is assumed. Such an assumption though is\nutopian as the stream is infinite and the labeling cost is prohibitive. To this\nend, we investigate the potential of active stream learning algorithms that ask\nfor labels on demand. Our proposed ACOSTREAM 1 approach works with limited\nlabels: it uses an initial seed of labeled documents, occasionally requests\nadditional labels for documents from the human expert and incrementally adapts\nto the underlying stream while exploiting the available labeled documents. In\nits core, ACOSTREAM consists of a MNB classifier coupled with \"sampling\"\nstrategies for requesting class labels for new unlabeled documents. In the\nexperiments, we evaluate the classifier performance over time by varying: (a)\nthe class distribution of the opinionated stream, while assuming that the set\nof the words in the vocabulary is fixed but their polarities may change with\nthe class distribution; and (b) the number of unknown words arriving at each\nmoment, while the class polarity may also change.

Time series observations of fish\nrecruitment reflect an interplay of underlying population processes,\nenvironmental forcing, measurement error, and process error. Given that the\nerror component is often very strong, an important unresolved question is\nwhether any non-random signal can be uncovered in the annual fluctuations of\nrecruitment time series.

Research priorities are now moving from planet detection to planet\ncharacterization. In this context, transiting exoplanets are of special\ninterest due to the wealth of data made available by their orbital\nconfiguration. Here, I introduce two methods to gain new insights into the\natmospheric and interior properties of exoplanets.\n  The first method aims to map an exoplanet's atmosphere based on the scanning\nobtained while it is occulted by its host star. I introduce the basics of\neclipse mapping, its caveats, and a framework to mitigate their effects via\nglobal analyses including transits, phase curves, and radial velocity\nmeasurements. I use this method to create the first 2D map and the first cloud\nmap of an exoplanet for the hot-Jupiters HD189733b and Kepler-7b, respectively.\nUltimately temperature, composition, and circulation patterns could be\nconstrained in 3D, a significant asset for informing atmospheric models.\n  The second method, MassSpec, aims to determine transiting planet masses and\natmospheric properties solely from transmission spectra. Determination of an\nexoplanet's mass is key to understanding its basic properties, including its\npotential for supporting life. To date, mass constraints for exoplanets are\nmainly based on radial velocity measurements, which are not suited for planets\nwith low masses, large semi-major axes, or those orbiting faint or active\nstars. I demonstrate that a planet's mass has to be accounted for by\natmospheric retrieval methods to avoid biases and that JWST could determine the\nmass and atmospheric properties of half a dozen Earth-sized planets in their\nhost's habitable zones over its lifetime, which could lead to the first\nidentification of a habitable exoplanet.\n","Comment: Ph.

The heavy quarks constitutes a unique probe of the\nQGP properties. Both at RHIC and LHC energies a puzzling relation between the\nnuclear modification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$ and the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$\nrelated to heavy quark has been observed which challenged all the existing\nmodels.\\\\ We discuss how the temperature dependence of the heavy quark drag\ncoefficient can address for a large part of such a puzzle. We have considered\nfour different models to evaluate the temperature dependence of drag and\ndiffusion coefficients propagating through a quark gluon plasma (QGP).

Those Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks\n(VANETs) are the basis for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs).

To be able to compare\ndifferent security architectures, different proposed approaches need to be\ndiscussed. One problem in current research is the missing focus on different\napproaches for trust establishment in VANETs. Therefore, this paper surveys\ndifferent security issues and solutions in VANETs and we furthermore categorize\nthese solutions into three basic trust defining architectures: centralized,\ndecentralized and hybrid. These categories represent how trust is build in a\nsystem, i.e., in a centralized, decentralized way or even by combining both\nopposing approaches to a hybrid solution, which aims to inherit the benefits of\nboth worlds. This survey defines those categories and finds that hybrid\napproaches are underrepresented in current research efforts.\n","Comment: The Ninth International Conference on Emerging Security Information,\n  Systems and Technologies - SECURWARE 2015, Venice, Italy, 2015"]}]

When the optical path\nlength (L=80 {\\mu}m) is shorter than the optical (for wavelength,\n{\\lambda}=632.8 nm) coherence length inside the magnetic nanofluid under\napplied field, a Debye diffraction ring pattern is observed; while for longer\npath length (L=1mm), a corona ring of scattered light is observed.
