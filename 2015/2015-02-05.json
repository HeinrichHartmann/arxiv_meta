We use a kinematic solar\ndynamo model with a novel set-up in which stochastic perturbations force two\ndistinct poloidal field alpha effects. We explore different regimes of\noperation of these poloidal sources with distinct operating thresholds, to\nidentify the importance of each. The perturbations are implemented\nindependently in both hemispheres which allows one to study the level of\nhemispheric coupling and hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots.\nFrom the simulations performed we identify a few different ways in which the\ndynamo can enter a grand minima episode. While fluctuations in any of the\n$\\alpha$ effects can trigger intermittency we find that the mean-field alpha\neffect is crucial for the recovery of the solar cycle from a grand minima\nepisode which a Babcock-Leighton source alone, fails to achieve. Our\nsimulations also demonstrate other cycle dynamics. We conclude that stochastic\nfluctuations in two interacting poloidal field sources working with distinct\noperating thresholds is a viable candidate for triggering episodes of extreme\nsolar activity and that the mean-field alpha effect capable of working on weak,\nsub-equipartition fields is critical to the recovery of the solar cycle\nfollowing an extended solar minimum.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, accepted in A&A (revised text and 2 references\n  added)"]}]

Since the beginning of the MAXI operation on August 15, 2009,\nGSC observed 35 GRBs up to the middle of 2013. One third of them are also\nobserved by other satellites. The rest of them show a trend to have soft\nspectra and low fluxes. Because of the contribution of those XRFs, the MAXI GRB\nrate is about three times higher than those expected from the BATSE log N - log\nP distribution. When we compare it to the observational results of the\nWide-field X-ray Monitor on the High Energy Transient Explorer 2, which covers\nthe the same energy range to that of MAXI/GSC, we find a possibility that many\nof MAXI bursts are XRFs with Epeak lower than 20 keV. We discuss the source of\nsoft GRBs observed only by MAXI. The MAXI log N - log S distribution suggests\nthat the MAXI XRFs distribute in closer distance than hard GRBs. Since the\ndistributions of the hardness of galactic stellar flares and X-ray bursts\noverlap with those of MAXI GRBs, we discuss a possibility of a confusion of\nthose galactic transients with the MAXI GRB samples.\n","Comment: 12 figures"]}]

Furthermore, identifying shocks in hydrodynamical\nsimulations and measuring their Mach number accurately is critical for\ncalculating the production of non-thermal particle components through diffusive\nshock acceleration. However, shocks are often significantly broadened in\nnumerical simulations, making it challenging to implement an accurate shock\nfinder.

The method is based on\nBiot's theory of wave propagation in porous materials. Empirical relations and\na priori information is used to characterize snow as a porous material as a\nfunction of porosity. Plane wave theory and an equivalent pore fluid are used\nto solve Biot's differential equations and to asses the impact of the air and\nwater in the pore space. The liquid water in the pore space of a snow pack\nreduces the velocity of the first compressional wave by roughly 300 m/s for\nevery 0.1 increase in liquid water saturation. Also the attenuation of the\ncompressional waves is increased with increasing liquid water content. Two end\nmember models for compaction are evaluated to asses the importance of an\nindependent density measurement for an estimate of liquid pore water saturation\nin snow with acoustic waves. The two end members correspond to no compaction at\nall and to a melting sphere packing where the grains remain in contact. The\nchange of velocity for the first compressional wave was found to strongly\ndepend on the compaction model, while the velocity of the second compressional\nwave mainly depends on liquid water saturation. Also the attenuation for both\ncompressional waves depends mainly on the liquid water saturation and only\nlittle on the compaction model. Finally, a simple field experiment illustrates\nthe potential use of the method to estimate the liquid water content of snow\nwith acoustic sensors.\n"]}]
