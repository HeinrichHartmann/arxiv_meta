Relay selection thus entails a\ntradeoff between the efficiency of the information transfer to the receiver and\nthe amount of energy transferred to the energy harvester.

Embedded within this topography is a fluvial network that is\nsensitive to variations in horizontal and vertical motions. The notion that a\nriver acts as a 'tape recorder' for vertical perturbations suggests that\nchanges in spatial and temporal characteristics of surface uplift can be\ndeduced through the analysis of longitudinal river profiles. We analyse 20\nlongitudinal river profiles around the Australian continent. Concave upward\nprofiles in northeast Australia indicate an absence of recent surface uplift.\nIn contrast, the major knickzones within longitudinal profiles of rivers in\nsouthwest Australia suggest recent surface uplift. Given the lack of recent\nlarge-scale tectonic activity in that region, this uplift requires an\nexplanation. Applying an inverse algorithm to river profiles of south Western\nAustralia reveals that this surface uplift started in the Eocene and culminated\nin the mid-late Neogene. The surface uplift rates deduced from this river\nprofile analysis generally agree with independent geological observations\nincluding preserved shallow-marine sediment outcrops across the Eucla Basin and\nsouth Western Australia.

A generic 3D crystal in contact with vacuum\ncontaining about 10^8 atoms and with a sinusoidal free surface roughness is\nshock loaded so as to undergo a solid-liquid phase change on shock. The\nreflection of the shock wave at the interface metal/vacuum gives rise to the\nejection of 2D jets/sheets of atoms (Richtmyer-Meshkov instabilities in the\ncontinuum limit) which develop and break up, forming ejecta (fragments) of\ndifferent volumes (or mass). The fragmentation process is investigated by\nanalyzing the evolution of the resulting volume distribution of the ejecta as a\nfunction of time. Two metals are studied (Cu and Sn) and the amplitude of the\nroughness is varied. The simulations show that the associated distributions\nexhibit a generic behavior with the sum of two distinct terms of varying\nweight, following the expansion rate of the jets: in the small size limit, the\ndistribution obeys a power law dependence with an exponent equal to 1.15 plus\nor minus 0.08 and in the large size limit, it obeys an exponential form.

Decreasing the pump intensity allows the generation of just\none photon pair from one of the crystals during one measuring interval,\nresulting in 1st-order interference of single photons. Varying the phase delay\nbetween the pump beams for the two crystals results in 1st-order single photon\ninterference but with a fringe period of about half of the photon wavelength.\nThis phase memory effect causes coherence across the two coupled\ninterferometers. And even for pump photon delays much larger than the coherence\nlength of the detected single photons the visibility is above 90 percent.\nTherefore this phase memory is a useful tool for investigating the\nwave-particle dualism in future experiments.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In\nthis article, we review theoretical studies of the Fermi liquid theory and\nCooper pairing instabilities of both electric and magnetic dipolar fermionic\nsystems from the perspective of unconventional symmetries. When the electric\ndipole moments are aligned by the external electric field, their interactions\nexhibit the explicit $d_{r^2-3z^2}$ anisotropy. The Fermi liquid properties,\nincluding the single-particle spectra, thermodynamic susceptibilities, and\ncollective excitations, are all affected by this anisotropy. The electric\ndipolar interaction provides a mechanism for the unconventional spin triplet\nCooper pairing, which is different from the usual spin-fluctuation mechanism in\nsolids and the superfluid $^3$He. Furthermore, the competition between pairing\ninstabilities in the singlet and triplet channels gives rise to a novel\ntime-reversal symmetry breaking superfluid state.

The resultant spin-orbit coupled Fermi\nliquid theory supports a collective sound mode exhibiting a topologically\nnon-trivial spin distribution over the Fermi surface.
