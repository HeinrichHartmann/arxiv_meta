This theory has a mass gap that is\nproportional to the topological mass $m$. Thus, Yang-Mills contribution decays\nexponentially at very large distances compared to $1/m$, leaving a pure\nChern-Simons theory with level number $k$. The focus of this research is the\n$near$ Chern-Simons limit of the theory, where the distance is large enough to\ngive an almost topological theory, with a small contribution from the\nYang-Mills term. It is shown that this almost topological theory consists of\ntwo copies of Chern-Simons with level number $k/2$, very similar to the\nChern-Simons splitting of topologically massive AdS gravity model. As $m$\napproaches to infinity, the split parts add up to give the original\nChern-Simons term with level $k$. Also, gauge invariance of the split\nChern-Simons theories is discussed for odd values of $k$. Furthermore, a\nrelation between the observables of topologically massive Yang-Mills theory and\nChern-Simons theory is obtained. It is shown that one of the two split\nChern-Simons pieces is associated with Wilson loops while the other with 't\nHooft loops.

Finally,\nmotivated with the topologically massive AdS gravity model, Chern-Simons\nsplitting concept is extended to pure Yang-Mills theory at large distances.
