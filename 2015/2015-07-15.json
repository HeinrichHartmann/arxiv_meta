The weak antilocalization always dominates the\nmagnetoconductivity near zero field, thus gives one of the transport signatures\nfor Weyl semimetals. In the presence of strong intervalley scattering and\ncorrelations, we expect a crossover from the weak antilocalization to weak\nlocalization. In addition, we find that the interplay of electron-electron\ninteraction and disorder scattering always dominates the conductivity at low\ntemperatures and leads to a tendency to localization. Finally, we present a\nsystematic comparison of the transport properties of single-valley Weyl\nfermions, 2D massless Dirac fermions, and 3D conventional electrons.\n","Comment: An extended version accepted by Phys.

It diverges at magnetic\nnulls, unifying GMR with magnetic null-point reconnection. Only under\nrestrictive assumptions is the slip velocity related to the gradient of the\nquasi potential (integral of parallel electric field along field lines). In a\nturbulent inertial range the curl becomes extremely large while the parallel\ncomponent is tiny, so that line slippage occurs even while ideal MHD becomes\naccurate. The resolution of this paradox is that ideal MHD is valid for a\nturbulent inertial-range only in a weak sense which does not imply magnetic\nline freezing. The notion of weak solution is explained in terms of spatial\ncoarse-graining and renormalization group (RG) theory. We give an argument for\nthe weak validity of the ideal Ohm's law in the inertial range, via rigorous\nestimates of the terms in the Generalized Ohm's Law for an electron-ion plasma.\nAll of the nonideal terms (from collisional resistivity, Hall field, electron\npressure anisotropy, and electron inertia) are shown to be irrelevant in the RG\nsense and large-scale reconnection is thus governed solely by ideal dynamics.\nWe briefly discuss some implications for heliospheric reconnection, in\nparticular for deviations from the Parker spiral model of interplanetary\nmagnetic field. Solar wind observations show that reconnection in a turbulence\nbroadened heliospheric current sheet, consistent with the Lazarian-Vishniac\ntheory, leads to slip velocities that cause field lines to lag relative to the\nspiral model.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 9 figures"]}]

Comparing the predicted anisotropic flow coefficients for charged\nhadrons with CMS data we find that both the Monte Carlo Glauber (MC-Glb) and\nMonte Carlo Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (MC-KLN) models produce initial fluctuation\nspectra that are incompatible with the measured final anisotropic flow power\nspectrum, for any choice of the specific shear viscosity. In spite of this\nfailure, we show that the hydrodynamic model can qualitatively explain, in\nterms of event-by-event fluctuations of the anisotropic flow coefficients and\nflow angles, the breaking of flow factorization for elliptic, triangular and\nquadrangular flow measured by the CMS experiment. For elliptic flow, this\nfactorization breaking is large in ultra-central collisions. We conclude that\nthe bulk of the experimentally observed flow factorization breaking effects are\nqualitatively explained by hydrodynamic evolution of initial-state\nfluctuations, but that their quantitative description requires a better\nunderstanding of the initial fluctuation spectrum.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 11 figures; In v2 and the current version, we updated all\n  the calculations (except for Fig. 2) that do not include microscopic\n  NN-correlations with a hard core radius of 0.9 fm.

Traditionally, the emission lines employed\nare in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is\nlimited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in\nhelium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical\nparameters, such as temperature and density. Recently, Izotov, Thuan, & Guseva\n(2014) have pioneered adding the He 10830 infrared emission line in helium\nabundance determinations. The strong electron density dependence of He 10830\nmakes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking the\ndegeneracy with temperature. We revisit our analysis of the dataset published\nby Izotov, Thuan, & Stasinska (2007) and incorporate the newly available\nobservations of He 10830 by scaling them using the observed-to-theoretical\nPaschen-gamma ratio. The solutions are better constrained, in particular for\nelectron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving the\nmodel fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening for\nquality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95% confidence level cut.\nFurthermore, the addition of He 10830 decreases the uncertainty on the helium\nabundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from\n10-80%. Overall, we find a reduction in the uncertainty on Y_p by over 50%.\nFrom a regression to zero metallicity, we determine Y_p = 0.2449 +/- 0.0040,\nconsistent with the BBN result, Y_p = 0.2470 +/- 0.0002, based on the Planck\ndetermination of the baryon density.

GPS\nis widely used to record the trajectories of vehicles, animals and human\nbeings. However, all GPS movement data are affected by both measurement and\ninterpolation error. In this article we show that measurement error causes a\nsystematic bias in distances recorded with a GPS: the distance between two\npoints recorded with a GPS is -- on average -- bigger than the true distance\nbetween these points. This systematic `overestimation of distance' becomes\nrelevant if the influence of interpolation error can be neglected, which is the\ncase for movement sampled at high frequencies. We provide a mathematical\nexplanation of this phenomenon and we illustrate that it functionally depends\non the autocorrelation of GPS measurement error ($C$). We argue that $C$ can be\ninterpreted as a quality measure for movement data recorded with a GPS. If\nthere is strong autocorrelation any two consecutive position estimates have\nvery similar error. This error cancels out when average speed, distance or\ndirection are calculated along the trajectory.\n  Based on our theoretical findings we introduce a novel approach to determine\n$C$ in real-world GPS movement data sampled at high frequencies. We apply our\napproach to a set of pedestrian and a set of car trajectories. We find that the\nmeasurement error in the data is strongly spatially and temporally\nautocorrelated and give a quality estimate of the data.

We\nstudy the effect of varying spatial resolution by degrading the image\nresolution of the largest images and find a sharp decrease in the\npixel-by-pixel mass estimate at a physical scale of approximately 3 kpc, which\nis comparable to spiral arm widths. The effects we observe are consistent with\nthe \"outshining\" idea which posits that the youngest stellar populations mask\nmore massive, older -- and thus fainter -- stellar populations. Although the\npresence of strong dust lanes can also lead to a drastic difference between\nresolved and unresolved mass estimates (up to 45% or 0.3 dex) for any\nindividual galaxy, we found that resolving dust does not affect mass estimates\non average. The strong correlation between mass discrepancy and sSFR is thus\nmost likely due to the outshining systematic bias.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

It seems that the method of building up a high gas fraction, which then\ntriggers star formation, is not the same for all local LCBGs. This may lead to\na dichotomy in galaxy characteristics. We consider possible gas delivery\nscenarios and suggest that clumpy spirals, preferentially located in clusters\nand with companions, are smoothly accreting gas from tidally disrupted\ncompanions and/or intracluster gas enriched by stripped satellites. Conversely,\nas non-clumpy galaxies are preferentially located in the field and tend to be\nisolated, we suggest clumpy, cold streams, which destroy galaxy disks and\nprevent clump formation, as a likely gas delivery mechanism for these systems.\nOther possibilities include smooth cold streams, a series of minor mergers, or\nmajor interactions.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 figures"]}]

This is a skill that seems to\nrequire extensive practice to obtain, suggesting a teaching strategy that\ninvolves the assignment of numerous exercises involving the formulation of some\nbit of knowledge, communicated using a natural language such as English, as a\nsentence in some logic. The number of such exercises needed to master this\nskill is far too large to allow typical artificial intelligence course teaching\nteams to provide prompt feedback on student efforts. Thus, an automated\nassessment system for such exercises is needed to ensure that students receive\nan adequate amount of practice, with the rapid delivery of feedback allowing\nstudents to identify errors in their understanding and correct them. This paper\ndescribes an automated grading system for knowledge representation exercises\nusing first-order logic. A resolution theorem prover, \\textit{Prover9}, is used\nto check if a student-submitted formula is logically equivalent to a solution\nprovided by the instructor. This system has been used by students enrolled in\nundergraduate artificial intelligence classes for several years.

Despite the small number of known hosts,\ntheir impact on our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution is immense.\nThese galaxies offer the opportunity to explore regions which are\nobservationally hostile, due to the presence of gas and dust, or the large\ndistances reached. The typical long-duration GRB host galaxy at low redshift is\nsmall, star-forming and metal poor, whereas, at intermediate redshift, many\nhosts are massive, dusty and chemically evolved. Going even farther in the past\nof the Universe, at z > 5, long-GRB hosts have never been identified, even with\nthe deepest NIR space observations, meaning that these galaxies are very small\n(stellar mass < 10^7 M_sun). We considered the possibility that some high-z\nGRBs occurred in primordial globular clusters, systems that evolved drastically\nsince the beginning, but would have back then the characteristics necessary to\nhost a GRB. At that time, the fraction of stellar mass contained in proto\nglobular clusters might have been orders of magnitude higher than today. Plus,\nthese objects contained in the past many massive fast rotating binary systems,\nwhich are also regarded as a favorable situation for GRBs.
