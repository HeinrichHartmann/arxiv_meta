The gravity\ndual at zero temperature captures the logarithmic runnings of the coupling\nconstants at far IR and the almost conformal, albeit strongly coupled, behavior\nat the UV. The full UV completion of gauge theory is accomplished in the\ngravity side by attaching an AdS cap to the IR geometry described in our\nprevious work. Attaching such an AdS cap is highly non-trivial because it\namounts to finding the right interpolating geometry and sources that take us\nfrom a gravity solution with non-zero three-form fluxes to another one that has\nalmost vanishing three-form fluxes. In this paper we give a concrete\nrealisation of such a scenario, completing the program advocated in our earlier\npaper. One of the main advantage of having such a background, in addition to\nproviding a dual description of the required gauge theory, is the absence of\nLandau poles and consequently the UV divergences of the Wilson loops. The\npotential for the heaviest fundamental quark anti-quark pairs, which are like\nthe heavy quarkonium states in realistic QCD, can be computed and their linear\nbehavior at large separations and zero temperature could be demonstrated. At\nsmall separations the expected Coulombic behavior appears to dominate. On the\nother hand, at non-zero temperatures interesting properties like heavy\nquarkonium type suppressions and melting are shown to emerge from our gravity\ndual.

Herein, control strategies which enable the\nsuperposition in time and frequency of primary and secondary user transmissions\nare explored in contrast to more traditional sensing approaches which only\nallow the secondary user to transmit when the primary user is idle. In this\nwork, the optimal transmission policy for the secondary user when the primary\nuser adopts a retransmission based error control scheme is investigated. The\npolicy aims to maximize the secondary users' throughput, with a constraint on\nthe throughput loss and failure probability of the primary user. Due to the\nconstraint, the optimal policy is randomized, and determines how often the\nsecondary user transmits according to the retransmission state of the packet\nbeing served by the primary user. The resulting optimal strategy of the\nsecondary user is proven to have a unique structure. In particular, the optimal\nthroughput is achieved by the secondary user by concentrating its transmission,\nand thus its interference to the primary user, in the first transmissions of a\nprimary user packet. The rather simple framework considered in this paper\nhighlights two fundamental aspects of cognitive networks that have not been\ncovered so far: (i) the networking mechanisms implemented by the primary users\n(error control by means of retransmissions in the considered model) react to\nsecondary users' activity; (ii) if networking mechanisms are considered, then\ntheir state must be taken into account when optimizing secondary users'\nstrategy, i.e., a strategy based on a binary active/idle perception of the\nprimary users' state is suboptimal.\n","Comment: accepted for publication on Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

Both forces are chosen to have Roberts\nflow-like geometry. Results: Examples with an MHD background are studied where\nthe previously used quasi-kinematic test-field method breaks down. In cases\nwith homogeneous mean fields it is shown that the generalized test-field method\nproduces the same results as the imposed-field method, where the field-aligned\ncomponent of the actual electromotive force from the simulation is used.\nFurthermore, results for the turbulent diffusivity tensor are given, which are\ninaccessible to the imposed-field method. For MHD backgrounds, new mean-field\neffects are found that depend on the occurrence of cross-correlations between\nmagnetic and velocity fluctuations. For strong imposed fields, $\\alpha$ is\nfound to be quenched proportional to the fourth power of the field strength,\nregardless of the type of background studied.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

Within first quantized theories,\nbesides flavor oscillations, chiral oscillations automatically appear when we\nset the dynamic equations for a fermionic Dirac-type particle. The left-handed\nchiral nature of created and detected neutrinos can be implemented in the first\nquantized Dirac theory in presence of mixing; the probability loss due to the\nchanging of initially left-handed neutrinos to the undetected right-handed\nneutrinos can be obtained in analytic form. In the context of a causal\nrelativistic theory of a free particle, one of the two effects should be\npresent in flavor oscillations: (a) rapid oscillations or (b) initial flavor\nviolation. Concerning second quantized approaches, a simple second quantized\ntreatment exhibits a tiny but inevitable initial flavor violation without the\npossibility of rapid oscillations. Such effect is a consequence of an\nintrinsically indefinite but approximately well defined neutrino flavor. The\nviolation effects are shown to be much larger than loop induced lepton flavor\nviolation processes, already present in the standard model in the presence of\nmassive neutrinos with mixing.

This leads to\na clear like-sign dilepton signal in the decay mode of \\xi^{\\pm\\pm} for a small\nvacuum expectation value (\\lsim 10^5 \\eV) of the triplet scalar \\xi= (\\xi^{++},\n\\xi^+, \\xi^0) of mass \\lsim 1 \\TeV. To be specific, for a mass range of\n200-1000 GeV of \\xi^{\\pm\\pm}, the like-sign dilepton signal can be detected at\nCERN LHC at a center of mass energy 14 TeV with an integrated luminosity > 30\n{\\rm fb}^{-1}. The same analysis is also pursued with center of mass energies 7\nTeV and 10 TeV as well. We also comment on the decay mode of singly charged\nscalars and neutral B-L gauge boson in this model.\n","Comment: Minor change in Introduction, Z' contribution to the production of\n  doubly charged scalars are explicitly shown, new figures added, new\n  references added.

We apply the projective\nsymmetry group(PSG) method to classify possible Z$_2$ spin liquid states within\nthis formalism on honeycomb lattice.

The zero-flux state is a promising candidate for the\nobserved spin liquid and continuous phase transition into commensurate N\\'eel\norder.

This problem has received increasing interest as an\nextension of the single channel sparse recovery problem which lies at the heart\nof the emerging field of compressed sensing. However the sparse approximation\nproblem has origins which include links to the field of array signal processing\nwhere we find the inspiration for a new family of MMV algorithms based on the\nMUSIC algorithm. We highlight the role of the rank of the coefficient matrix X\nin determining the difficulty of the recovery problem. We derive the necessary\nand sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the sparse MMV solution, which\nindicates that the larger the rank of X the less sparse X needs to be to ensure\nuniqueness. We also show that the larger the rank of X the less the\ncomputational effort required to solve the MMV problem through a combinatorial\nsearch. In the second part of the paper we consider practical suboptimal\nalgorithms for solving the sparse MMV problem. We examine the rank awareness of\npopular algorithms such as SOMP and mixed norm minimization techniques and show\nthem to be rank blind in terms of worst case analysis. We then consider a\nfamily of greedy algorithms that are rank aware. The simplest such algorithm is\na discrete version of MUSIC and is guaranteed to recover the sparse vectors in\nthe full rank MMV case under mild conditions. We extend this idea to develop a\nrank aware pursuit algorithm that naturally reduces to Order Recursive Matching\nPursuit (ORMP) in the single measurement case and also provides guaranteed\nrecovery in the full rank multi-measurement case.
