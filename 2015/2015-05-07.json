The main result of this manuscript is to\ngive a systematic method for producing an explicit presentation by generators\nand relations of the equivariant and ordinary cohomology rings (with\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ coefficients) of any regular nilpotent Hessenberg variety\n$\\mathrm{Hess}(h)$ in type A. Specifically, we give an explicit algorithm,\ndepending only on the Hessenberg function $h$, which produces the $n$ defining\nrelations $\\{f_{h(j),j}\\}_{j=1}^n$ in the equivariant cohomology ring. Our\nresult generalizes known results: for the case $h=(2,3,4,...,n,n)$, which\ncorresponds to the Peterson variety $\\mathrm{Pet}_n$, we recover the\npresentation of $H^*_S(\\mathrm{Pet}_n)$ given previously by Fukukawa, Harada,\nand Masuda. Moreover, in the case $h=(n,n,...,n)$, for which the corresponding\nregular nilpotent Hessenberg variety is the full flag variety\n$\\mathrm{Flags}(\\mathbb{C}^n)$, we can explicitly relate the generators of our\nideal with those in the usual Borel presentation of the cohomology ring of\n$\\mathrm{Flags}(\\mathbb{C}^n)$. The proof of our main theorem includes an\nargument that the restriction homomorphism $H^*_T(\\mathrm{Flags}(\\mathbb{C}^n))\n\\to H^*_S(\\mathrm{Hess}(h))$ is surjective. In this research announcement, we\nbriefly recount the context and state our results; we also give a sketch of our\nproofs and conclude with a brief discussion of open questions. A manuscript\ncontaining more details and full proofs is forthcoming.\n","Comment: 8 pages. Expository changes based on comments by a referee"]}]

The position\nvectors and velocities of infall halos are aligned with the principal axes of\nthe local tidal field, and the alignment depends on the strength of the tidal\nfield. Opposite accretion patterns are found in weak and strong tidal fields,\nin the sense that in a weak field the accretion flow is dominated by radial\nmotion within the local structure, while a large tangential component is\npresent in a strong field. These findings can be used to understand the strong\nalignments we find between the principal axes of the internal velocity\nellipsoids of halos and the local tidal field, and their dependence on the\nstrength of tidal field. They also explain why halo spin increases with the\nstrength of local tidal field, but only in weak tidal fields does the\nspin-tidal field alignment follow the prediction of the tidal torque theory.

The host\ngalaxy properties show that this highly obscured AGN is hosted in a massive\nstar-forming galaxy, showing a barred morphology, which is known to correlate\nwith the presence of CT absorbers. Finally, asymmetric and blueshifted\ncomponents in several optical high-ionization emission lines indicate the\npresence of a galactic outflow, possibly driven by the intense AGN activity\n(L(Bol)/L(Edd) = 0.3-0.5). Such highly obscured, highly accreting AGN are\nintrinsically very rare at low redshift, whereas they are expected to be much\nmore common at the peak of the star formation and BH accretion history, at\nz~2-3.

The atherosclerotic plaques in\na part of arterial wall are inhomogeneous on size and on distribution. In order\nto understand this in-homogeneity, the pathology of atherosclerotic plaques is\nanalyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism proposed in our\nMisrepair-accumulation aging theory. I. Development of an atherosclerotic\nplaque is a result of repair of injured endothelium. Because of infusion and\ndeposition of lipids beneath endothelial cells, the repair has to be achieved\nby altered remodeling of local endothelium. Such a repair is a manifestation of\nMisrepair. During repair, smooth muscular cells (SMCs) are clustered and\ncollagen fibers are produced to the lesion of endothelium for reconstructing an\nanchoring structure for endothelial cells and for forming a barrier to isolate\nthe lipids. II. Altered remodeling (Misrepair) makes a local part of\nendothelium have increased damage sensitivity and reduced repair-efficiency;\nthus this part of endothelium will have increased risk for injuries, for\nlipid-infusion and for Misrepairs. Focal accumulation of Misrepairs and focal\ndeposition of lipids result in development of a plaque. III. By a viscous\ncircle between lipid-infusion and endothelium-Misrepair, growing of a plaque is\nself-accelerating. Namely, once a plaque develops, it grows in an increasing\nrate with time and it does not stop growing. Within a part of arterial wall,\nolder plaques grow faster than younger ones; thus old plaques are always bigger\nthan new ones, resulting in an in-homogenous distribution of plaques. The\noldest and the biggest plaque is the most threatening one in narrowing local\nvessel lumen; therefore the accelerated growing of plaques is a fatal factor in\natherosclerosis.\n"]}]

If $G$ is an abelian group, then\n$H(G,S)$ is well-known to be a Cayley graph; however, there are examples of\nnon-abelian groups $G$ and subsets $S$ when this is not the case. In this paper\nwe address the problem of classifying finite non-abelian groups $G$ with the\nproperty that every Haar graph $H(G,S)$ is a Cayley graph. An equivalent\ncondition for $H(G,S)$ to be a Cayley graph of a group containing $G$ is\nderived in terms of $G, S$ and $\\mathrm{Aut }G$. It is also shown that the\ndihedral groups, which are solutions to the above problem, are\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2^2,D_3,D_4$ and $D_{5}$.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 2 figures"]}]
