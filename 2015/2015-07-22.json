The accuracy of recent parameter measurements is generally what would\nbe expected given the quoted error bars, although before the year 2000, the\naccuracy was significantly worse, consistent with an average underestimate of\nthe error bars by a factor of ~2.

The region of the Galactic\nplane covered is l=300-0-60deg where star-formation is highest and the emission\nis strong enough to make meaningful component separation. The latitude widths\nin this longitude range lie between 1deg and 2deg, which correspond to FWHM\nz-widths of 100-200pc at a typical distance of 6kpc.

In\nthis work we investigate if the very same process of assembly and growth of\nstructures is one of the major drivers of the observed decline. We study the\ncontribution to the CSFH of galaxies in halos of different masses. This is done\nby studying the total SFR-halo mass-redshift plane from redshift 0 to redshift\nz~1.6 in a sample of 57 groups and clusters by using the deepest available mid-\nand far-infrared surveys conducted with Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS and\nSPIRE. Our results show that low mass groups provide a 60-80% contribution to\nthe CSFH at z~1. Such contribution declines faster than the CSFH in the last 8\nbillion years to less than 10% at z<0.3, where the overall SF activity is\nsustained by lower mass halos. More massive systems provide only a marginal\ncontribution (<10%) at any epoch. A simplified abundance matching method shows\nthat the large contribution of low mass groups at z~1 is due to a large\nfraction (>50%) of very massive, highly star forming Main Sequence galaxies.\nBelow z~1 a quenching process must take place in massive halos to cause the\nobserved faster suppression of their SF activity. Such process must be a slow\none though, as most of the models implementing a rapid quenching of the SF\nactivity in accreting satellites significantly underpredicts the observed SF\nlevel in massive halos at any redshift. Starvation or the transition from cold\nto hot accretion would provide a quenching timescale of 1 Gyrs more consistent\nwith the observations. Our results suggest a scenario in which, due to the\nstructure formation process, more and more galaxies experience the group\nenvironment and, thus, the associated quenching process. This leads to the\nprogressive suppression of their SF activity shaping the CSFH below z~1.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 21 figures, accepted for publication by A&A"]}]

Then we give an overview\nof weak-lensing measurements, and present the main observational cosmic-shear\nresults since it was discovered 15 years ago, as well as the implications for\ncosmology. We then conclude with an outlook on the various future surveys and\nmissions, for which cosmic shear is one of the main science drivers, and\ndiscuss promising new weak cosmological lensing techniques for future\nobservations.\n","Comment: 65 pages (single column format), 12 figures, 1 table.

An unexpected consequence of our results is that the beta\nfunctions of the couplings may depend on the gauge-fixing parameters, although\nthe physical quantities remain gauge independent. We discuss nontrivial checks\nof high-order calculations based on gauge independence and determine how\npowerful they are.\n","Comment: 56 pages; v3: some expanded arguments, more references, PRD version"]}]

The result\ngeneralises reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) and kinetic RMHD (Schekochihin\net al. 2009) for pressure-anisotropic plasmas, allowing for species drifts---a\nsituation routinely encountered in the solar wind and presumably ubiquitous in\nhot dilute astrophysical plasmas (e.g. intracluster medium). Two main\nobjectives are achieved. First, in a non-Maxwellian plasma, the relationships\nbetween fluctuating fields (e.g., the Alfven ratio) are order-unity modified\ncompared to the more commonly considered Maxwellian case, and so a quantitative\ntheory is developed to support quantitative measurements now possible in the\nsolar wind. The main physical feature of low-frequency plasma turbulence\nsurvives the generalisation to non-Maxwellian distributions: Alfvenic and\ncompressive fluctuations are energetically decoupled, with the latter passively\nadvected by the former; the Alfvenic cascade is fluid, satisfying RMHD\nequations (with the Alfven speed modified by pressure anisotropy and species\ndrifts), whereas the compressive cascade is kinetic and subject to\ncollisionless damping. Secondly, the organising principle of this turbulence is\nelucidated in the form of a generalised kinetic free-energy invariant. It is\nshown that non-Maxwellian features in the distribution function reduce the rate\nof phase mixing and the efficacy of magnetic stresses; these changes influence\nthe partitioning of free energy amongst the various cascade channels. As the\nfirehose or mirror instability thresholds are approached, the dynamics of the\nplasma are modified so as to reduce the energetic cost of bending\nmagnetic-field lines or of compressing/rarefying them. Finally, it is shown\nthat this theory can be derived as a long-wavelength limit of non-Maxwellian\nslab gyrokinetics.\n","Comment: 61 pages, accepted to Journal of Plasma Physics; Abstract abridged"]}]

A key prediction is that for unpolarized nucleons in Witten\nkinematics, the proton-antiproton annihilation cross-section should be equal to\nthe proton-antineutron annihilation cross-section up to corrections of relative\norder $1/N_c$. Unpolarized nucleon-antinucleon annihilation data appears to be\nconsistent with this expectation.\n","Comment: Minor typos fixed in new version"]}]

A\nfast outflow of molecular gas extends along the entire radio jet, with the\nhighest outflow velocities about 0.5kpc from the nucleus, at the location of\nthe brighter hot-spot in the W lobe. The data show that a massive, fast outflow\nwith velocities up to 650 km/s of cold molecular gas is present, in addition to\none detected earlier in warm H2, HI and ionised gas. Both the central AGN and\nthe radio jet could energetically drive the outflow. However, the\ncharacteristics of the outflowing gas point to the radio jet being the main\ndriver. This is important, because IC5063, although one of the most powerful\nSeyfert galaxies, is a relatively weak radio source (P = 3x10^23 W/Hz). All the\nobserved characteristics can be described by a scenario of a radio plasma jet\nexpanding into a clumpy medium, interacting directly with the clouds and\ninflating a cocoon that drives a lateral outflow into the interstellar medium.\nThis model is consistent with results obtained by recent simulations such as\nthose of Wagner et al.. A stronger, direct interaction between the jet and a\ngas cloud is present at the location of the brighter W lobe. Even assuming the\nmost conservative values for the conversion factor CO-to-H2, the mass of the\noutflowing gas is between 1.9 and 4.8x10^7 Msun. These amounts are much larger\nthan those of the outflow of warm gas (molecular and ionized) and somewhat\nlarger than of the HI outflow. This suggests that most of the observed cold\nmolecular outflow is due to fast cooling after being shocked. This gas is the\nend product of the cooling process.

For comparison with stable sunspots, we also analyse\nthe two maps observed by Hinode/SP on the same spot after the penumbra formed.\nThe vertical component of the magnetic field, $B_{\\rm ver}$, at the\numbra-penumbra boundary increases during penumbra formation owing to the\nincursion of the penumbra into umbral areas.

Methods: The clear\nperiodicity of the system LSI+61303 allowed observations to be scheduled\ncovering the large radio outburst in March-April 2012. We observed LSI+61303 on\n14 consecutive days at 2.6, 4.85, 8.35, 10.45, 14.3, 23, and 32 GHz with a\ncadence of about 12 hours followed by two additional observations several days\nlater. Based on these observations we obtained a total of 24 quasi-simultaneous\nbroad-band radio spectra. Results: During onset, the main flare shows an almost\nflat broad-band spectrum, most prominently seen on March 27, 2012, where - for\nthe first time - a flat spectrum (alpha=0.00+/-0.07, S nu^alpha) is observed up\nto 32 GHz (9 mm wavelength). The flare decay phase shows superimposed\n'sub-flares' with the spectral index oscillating between -0.4 and -0.1 in a\nquasi-regular fashion. Finally, the spectral index steepens during the decay\nphase, showing optically thin emission with values alpha $\\sim$ -0.5 to -0.7.\nConclusions: The radio characteristics of LSI+61303 compare well with those of\nthe microquasars XTE J1752-223 and Cygnus X-3. In these systems the flaring\nphase is actually also composed of a sequence of outbursts with clearly\ndifferent spectral characteristics: a first outburst with a flat/inverted\nspectrum followed by a bursting phase of optically thin emission.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

As a corollary of our main results, we\nobtain the non-faithfullness of the family of cylinders generated by the\nclassical L\\\"uroth expansion.\n  Possible infinite entropy of the stochastic vector $Q_\\infty$ which\ndetermines the metric relations for partitions of the generalized L\\\"uroth\nexpansions, possible non-faithfulness of the family $\\Phi(Q_\\infty)$ and the\nabsence of general formulae for the calculation of the Hausdorff dimension even\nfor probability measures with independent identically distributed symbols of\ngeneralized L\\\"uroth expansions are all facts that do not allow to apply usual\nprobabilistic methods, as well as methods of dynamical systems to study fractal\nproperties of corresponding subsets of non-normal numbers.\n  Despite of the above mentioned difficulties, we develop new approach to the\nstudy of subsets of $Q_\\infty$-essentially non-normal numbers and prove\n(without any additional restrictions on the stochastic vector $Q_{\\infty}$)\nthat this set is superfractal. This result answers the open problem mentioned\nin \\cite{AKNT2} and completes the metric, dimensional and topological\nclassification of real numbers via the asymptotic behaviour of frequencies\ntheir digits in the generalized L\\\"uroth expansion.\n"]}]
