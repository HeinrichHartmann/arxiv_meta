Here, we revisit the derivation of the\ngravitationally coupled Dirac equation and find that the prefactor of a result\ngiven previously in [D.R. Brill and J.A. Wheeler, Rev. Mod. Phys., vol. 29, p.\n465 (1957)] for the affine connection matrix is in need of a correction. We\nalso discuss the conversion the curved-space Dirac equation from East-Coast to\nWest-Coast conventions, in order to bring the gravitationally coupled Dirac\nequation to a form where it can easily be unified with the electromagnetic\ncoupling as it is commonly used in modern particle physics calculations. The\nDirac equation describes anti-particles as negative-energy states. We find a\nsymmetry of the gravitationally coupled Dirac equation, which connects particle\nand antiparticle solutions for a general space-time metric of the Schwarzschild\ntype and implies that particles and antiparticles experience the same coupling\nto the gravitational field, including all relativistic quantum corrections of\nmotion. Our results demonstrate the consistency of quantum mechanics with\ngeneral relativity and imply that a conceivable difference of gravitational\ninteraction of hydrogen and antihydrogen should directly be attributed to a a\n\"fifth force\" (\"quintessence\").\n","Comment: 8 pages; RevTeX; Eqs.
