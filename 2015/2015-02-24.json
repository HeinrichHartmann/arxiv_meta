It is shown that in a typical application\ncase, where uniform data readings are transformed to the same number of\nuniformly spaced frequencies, the results of the classical DFT and proposed\napproach coincide. The difference in performance appears when the length of the\nDFT is selected to be greater than the length of the data. The DFT solves the\nunknown data problem by padding readings with zeros up to the length of the\nDFT, while the proposed Extended DFT (EDFT) deals with this situation in a\ndifferent way, it uses the Fourier integral transform as a target and optimizes\nthe transform basis in the extended frequency range without putting such\nrestrictions on the time domain. Consequently, the Inverse DFT (IDFT) applied\nto the result of EDFT returns not only known readings, but also the\nextrapolated data, where classical DFT is able to give back just zeros, and\nhigher resolution are achieved at frequencies where the data has been\nsuccessfully extended. It has been demonstrated that EDFT able to process data\nwith missing readings or gaps inside or even nonuniformly distributed data.\nThus, EDFT significantly extends the usability of the DFT-based methods, where\npreviously these approaches have been considered as not applicable. The EDFT\nfounds the solution in an iterative way and requires repeated calculations to\nget the adaptive basis, and this makes it numerical complexity much higher\ncompared to DFT. This disadvantage was a serious problem in the 1990s, when the\nmethod has been proposed. Fortunately, since then the power of computers has\nincreased so much that nowadays EDFT application could be considered as a real\nalternative.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Mediators produced on-shell and decaying invisibly to\nhidden-sector particles such as dark matter can be probed particularly well.\nSensitivity to light dark matter produced through an off-shell mediator is more\nlimited, but may be improved with a better control of backgrounds, allowing\nbackground estimation and a search for kinematic edges.

For solid state electron-spin qubits the\ninteraction with nuclear spins is the main problem. One particular, neradicable\nsource of electron decoherence arises from decoherence of the nuclear spin\nbath, driven by nuclear-nuclear dipolar interactions. Due to its many-body\nnature nuclear decoherence is difficult to predict, especially for an important\nclass of strained nanostructures where nuclear quadrupolar effects have a\nsignificant but largely unknown impact. Here we report direct measurement of\nnuclear spin bath coherence in individual strained InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots:\nnuclear spin-echo coherence times in the range T2~1.2 - 4.5 ms are found.

A set of $n$ processors is connected into a $d$-regular\nundirected network. In every time step, each processor exchanges some of its\ntokens with each of its neighbors in the network. The goal is to minimize the\ndiscrepancy between the number of tokens on the most-loaded and the\nleast-loaded processor as quickly as possible.\n  Rabani et al. (1998) present a general technique for the analysis of a wide\nclass of discrete load balancing algorithms. Their approach is to characterize\nthe deviation between the actual loads of a discrete balancing algorithm with\nthe distribution generated by a related Markov chain. The Markov chain can also\nbe regarded as the underlying model of a continuous diffusion algorithm. Rabani\net al. showed that after time $T = O(\\log (Kn)/\\mu)$, any algorithm of their\nclass achieves a discrepancy of $O(d\\log n/\\mu)$, where $\\mu$ is the spectral\ngap of the transition matrix of the graph, and $K$ is the initial load\ndiscrepancy in the system.\n  In this work we identify some natural additional conditions on deterministic\nbalancing algorithms, resulting in a class of algorithms reaching a smaller\ndiscrepancy. This class contains well-known algorithms, eg., the Rotor-Router.\nSpecifically, we introduce the notion of cumulatively fair load-balancing\nalgorithms where in any interval of consecutive time steps, the total number of\ntokens sent out over an edge by a node is the same (up to constants) for all\nadjacent edges. We prove that algorithms which are cumulatively fair and where\nevery node retains a sufficient part of its load in each step, achieve a\ndiscrepancy of $O(\\min\\{d\\sqrt{\\log n/\\mu},d\\sqrt{n}\\})$ in time $O(T)$. We\nalso show that in general neither of these assumptions may be omitted without\nincreasing discrepancy. We then show by a combinatorial potential reduction\nargument that any cumulatively fair scheme satisfying some additional\nassumptions achieves a discrepancy of $O(d)$ almost as quickly as the\ncontinuous diffusion process. This positive result applies to some of the\nsimplest and most natural discrete load balancing schemes.\n","Comment: minor corrections; updated literature overview"]}]

However, it is not\nknown how the synaptic efficacies in the neuronal networks of the brain adapt\nsuch that they can reliably generate spikes at specific points in time.\nExisting activity-dependent plasticity rules like Spike-Timing-Dependent\nPlasticity are agnostic to the goal of learning spike times.

Since the relevant\nsignal for synaptic change is the postsynaptic voltage rather than spike times,\nwe call the plasticity rule Membrane Potential Dependent Plasticity (MPDP).\nCombining our plasticity mechanism with spike after-hyperpolarization causes a\nsensitivity of synaptic change to pre- and postsynaptic spike times which can\nreproduce Hebbian spike timing dependent plasticity for inhibitory synapses as\nwas found in experiments. In addition, the sensitivity of MPDP to the time\ncourse of the voltage when generating a spike allows MPDP to distinguish\nbetween weak (spurious) and strong (teacher) spikes, which therefore provides a\nneuronal basis for the comparison of actual and target activity. For\nspatio-temporal input spike patterns our conceptually simple plasticity rule\nachieves a surprisingly high storage capacity for spike associations.

All the sources use channel contention\nto get transmission opportunity. If a source wins the contention, the channel\nstate information in the first-hop channel (from the source to its relay) is\nestimated, and a decision is made for the winner source to either give up the\ntransmission opportunity and let all sources start a new contention, or\ntransmit to the relay. Once the relay gets the traffic, it may have a sequence\nof probings of the second-hop channel (from the relay to the destination).\nAfter each probing, if the second-hop channel is good enough, the relay\ntransmits to the destination and completes the transmission process of the\nsource; otherwise, the relay decides either to give up and let all sources\nstart a new contention, or to continue to probe the second-hop channel. The\noptimal decision strategies for the two hops are derived in this letter. The\nfirst-hop strategy is a pure-threshold strategy, i.e., when the first-hop\nchannel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is more than a threshold, the winner source\nshould transmit to the relay, and subsequently the second-hop strategy should\nlet the relay keep probing the second-hop channel until a good enough\nsecond-hop channel is observed.

In multiple services\nproviding wireless network, excessive call blocking of lower priority traffic\nis very often event at very high traffic rate which is a concerning issue for\nQoS provisioning.
