In order to study these\nphenomena in large-scale assemblies of neurons, we consider networks of\nfiring-rate neurons with linear intrinsic dynamics and nonlinear coupling,\nbelonging to a few types of cell populations and receiving noisy currents.\nAsymptotic equations as the number of neurons tends to infinity (mean field\nequations) are rigorously derived based on a probabilistic approach. These\nequations are implicit on the probability distribution of the solutions which\ngenerally makes their direct analysis difficult. However, in our case, the\nsolutions are Gaussian, and their moments satisfy a closed system of nonlinear\nordinary differential equations (ODEs), which are much easier to study than the\noriginal stochastic network equations, and the statistics of the empirical\nprocess uniformly converge towards the solutions of these ODEs. Based on this\ndescription, we analytically and numerically study the influence of noise on\nthe collective behaviors, and compare these asymptotic regimes to simulations\nof the network. We observe that the mean field equations provide an accurate\ndescription of the solutions of the network equations for network sizes as\nsmall as a few hundreds of neurons. In particular, we observe that the level of\nnoise in the system qualitatively modifies its collective behavior, producing\nfor instance synchronized oscillations of the whole network, desynchronization\nof oscillating regimes, and stabilization or destabilization of stationary\nsolutions.

The performance of such a system is usually characterized by its\nsecrecy capacity determining the maximum transmission rate of secure\ncommunication. In this paper, the issue of whether the secrecy capacity is a\ncontinuous function of the system parameters or not is examined. In particular,\nthis is done for channel uncertainty modeled via compound channels and\narbitrarily varying channels, in which the legitimate users know only that the\ntrue channel realization is from a pre-specified uncertainty set. In the former\nmodel, this realization remains constant for the whole duration of\ntransmission, while in the latter the realization varies from channel use to\nchannel use in an unknown and arbitrary manner. These models not only capture\nthe case of channel uncertainty, but are also suitable to model scenarios in\nwhich a malicious adversary influences or jams the legitimate transmission. The\nsecrecy capacity of the compound wiretap channel is shown to be robust in the\nsense that it is a continuous function of the uncertainty set. Thus, small\nvariations in the uncertainty set lead to small variations in secrecy capacity.\nOn the other hand, the deterministic secrecy capacity of the arbitrarily\nvarying wiretap channel is shown to be discontinuous in the uncertainty set\nmeaning that small variations can lead to dramatic losses in capacity.\n","Comment: revised.

Plas. 21, 060705 (2014),\nestablished that the generation of octupolar out-of-plane magnetic field\nstructure in a stressed $X$-point collapse is due to ion currents. The field\nhas a central region, comprising of the well-known qaudrupolar field\n(quadrupolar components), as well as four additional poles of reversed polarity\ncloser to the corners of the domain (octupolar components). In this extended\nwork, the dependence of the octupolar structure on domain size and ion mass\nvariation is investigated. Simulations show that the strength and spatial\nstructure of the generated octupolar magnetic field is independent of ion to\nelectron mass ratio. Thus showing that ion currents play a significant role in\nout-of-plane magnetic structure generation in physically realistic scenarios.\nSimulations of different system sizes show that the width of the octupolar\nstructure remains the same and has a spacial extent of the order of the ion\ninertial length. The width of the structure thus appears to be independent on\nboundary condition effects. The length of the octupolar structure however\nincreases for greater domain sizes, prescribed by the external system size.\nThis was found to be a consequence of the structure of the in-plane magnetic\nfield in the outflow region halting the particle flow and thus terminating the\nin-plane currents that generate the out-of-plane field. The generation of\noctupolar magnetic field structure is also established in a tearing-mode\nreconnection scenario. The differences in the generation of the octupolar field\nand resulting qualitative differences between $X$-point collapse and\ntearing-mode are discussed.\n","Comment: Published in Physics of Plasmas. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1406.3890"]}]

A Kinetic Monte Carlo model corroborates\nthese reasonings.

A minimum is found in the rate for self-avoiding\npolymers of intermediate length while the escape rate decreases monotonically\nwith polymer length for ideal polymers. The increase in the rate for long,\nself-avoiding polymers is ascribed to crowding in the potential well which\nreduces the free energy escape barrier. An effective potential curve obtained\nusing the centroid as an independent variable was evaluated by thermodynamic\naveraging and Kramers rate theory then applied to estimate the escape rate.\nWhile the qualitative features are well reproduced by this approach, it\nsignificantly overestimates the rate, especially for the longer polymers. The\nreason for this is illustrated by constructing a two-dimensional effective\nenergy surface using the radius of gyration as well as the centroid as\ncontrolled variables. This shows that the description of a transition state\ndividing surface using only the centroid fails to confine the system to the\nregion corresponding to the free energy barrier and this problem becomes more\npronounced the longer the polymer is. A proper definition of a transition state\nfor polymer escape needs to take into account the shape as well as the location\nof the polymer.\n"]}]

In particular, these complex and dynamic\nenvironments may be poorly represented by standard experimental and theoretical\nmodels. In this work, we study the performance of various chemotactic\nstrategies under a range of stochastic time- and space-varying attractant\ndistributions in silico. We describe a novel type of response in which the\nbacterium tumbles more when attractant concentration is increasing, in contrast\nto the response of E. coli, and demonstrate how this response explains the\nbehavior of aerobically-grown Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In this \"speculator\"\nresponse, bacteria compare the current attractant concentration to the\nlong-term average. By tumbling persistently when the current concentration is\nhigher than the average, bacteria maintain their position in regions of high\nattractant concentration. If the current concentration is lower than the\naverage, or is declining, bacteria swim away in search of more favorable\nconditions. When the attractant distribution is spatially complex but\nslowly-changing, this response is as effective as that of E. coli.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table"]}]

A parametrized\nLL (pLL) model is created by multiplying selected matrix elements of the\nHamiltonian operators by scaling factors that depend on element types. Various\nschemes for applying the scaling factors are compared, along with the impact of\nmaking the scaling factors linear functions of variables related to bond\nlengths, atomic charges, and bond orders. The models are trained on ethane and\nethylene, substituted with -NH2, -OH and -F, and tested on substituted propane,\npropylene and t-butane. Training and test datasets are created by distorting\nthe molecular geometries and applying uniform electric fields. The fitted\nproperties include changes in total energy arising from geometric distortions\nor applied fields, and frontier orbital energies. The impacts of including\nadditional training data, such as decomposition of the energy by operator or\ninteraction of the electron density with external charges, are also explored.\nThe best-performing model forms reduce the root mean square (RMS) difference\nbetween the HL and LL energy predictions by over 85% on the training data and\nover 75% on the test data.
