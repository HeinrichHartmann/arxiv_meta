Intuitively, one considers given\nmeasurements to be incompatible within a framework of a physical theory, if\ntheir simultaneous implementation on a single physical device is prohibited by\nthe theory itself.

We define operational ways of quantifying this\nresource via the amount of added classical noise needed to render the\nmeasurements compatible, i.e., useless as a resource.

In the Milky Way, most globular clusters are highly conspicuous\nobjects that were found centuries ago. However, a few dozen of them are faint,\nsparsely populated systems that were identified largely during the second half\nof the past century. One of the faintest is ESO 37-1 (E 3) and as such it\nremains poorly studied, with no spectroscopic observations published so far,\nalthough it was discovered in 1976.\n  Aims. We investigate the globular cluster E 3 in an attempt to better\nconstrain its fundamental parameters. Spectroscopy of stars in the field of E 3\nis shown here for the first time.\n  Methods. Deep, precise VI CCD photometry of E 3 down to V=26 mag is presented\nand analysed. Low-resolution, medium signal-to-noise ratio spectra of nine\ncandidate members are studied to derive radial velocity and metallicity. Proper\nmotions from the UCAC4 catalogue are used to explore the kinematics of the\nbright members of E 3.\n  Results. Isochrone fitting indicates that E 3 is probably very old, with an\nage of about 13 Gyr; its distance from the Sun is nearly 10 kpc. It is also\nsomewhat metal rich with [Fe/H]=-0.7. Regarding its kinematics, our tentative\nestimate for the proper motions is (-7.0+/-0.8, 3.5+/-0.3) mas/yr (or a\ntangential velocity of 382+/-79 km/s) and for the radial velocity is 45+/-5\nkm/s, in the solar rest frame.\n  Conclusions. E 3 is one of the most intriguing globular clusters in the\nGalaxy. Having an old age and being metal rich is clearly a peculiar\ncombination, only seen in a handful of objects like the far more conspicuous\nNGC 104 (47 Tucanae). In addition, its low luminosity and sparse population\nmake it a unique template for the study of the final evolutionary phases in the\nlife of a star cluster. Unfortunately, E 3 is among the most elusive and\nchallenging known globular clusters because field contamination severely\nhampers spectroscopic studies.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6+1 figures, 2 tables.

Methods: A local injury model is adopted, in which radiation-induced\ndamage (functional loss) G is the integral of the DVH with function R(D). RP\nrisk is H(G) where H() is the sigmoid cumulative distribution of functional\nreserve. RP incidence is a Bernoulli function of risk. A homogeneous patient\ncohort is assumed, allowing non-dose-related factors to be ignored. Clinically\nrealistic DVHs are combined with the injury model to simulate RP data. Results:\nCorrelation analysis is often used to identify predictor variables that are\ncorrelated with outcome, for inclusion in a predictive model. In the local\ninjury model, all DVH metrics VD contribute to damage. Correlation analysis\ntherefore has limited value. The subset of VD significantly correlated with\nincidence varies randomly from trial to trial due to random variations in the\nDVH set, and does not necessarily reveal anything useful about the patient\ncohort or the underlying biological dose-response relationship. Regression or\nmatrix analysis can extract R(D) from damage or risk data, provided smoothness\nregularization is employed. Extraction of R(D) from incidence data was not\nsuccessful, due to its higher level of statistical variability. Conclusions: To\nthe author's knowledge, smoothness regularization has not been applied to this\nproblem, so represents a novel approach. Dose-response functions can be\nsuccessfully extracted from measurements of integral (as opposed to regional)\nlung damage G, suggesting value in re-visiting available measurements of\nventilation, perfusion and radiographic damage.

We prove that when $c\\geq c_0$, the species always dies out in the\nlong-run, but when $0<c<c_0$, the long-time behavior of the species is\ndetermined by a trichotomy described by\n  (a) {\\it vanishing}, (b) {\\it borderline spreading}, or (c) {\\it spreading}.\nIf the initial population is writen in the form $u_0(x)=\\sigma \\phi(x)$ with\n$\\phi$ fixed and $\\sigma>0$ a parameter, then there exists $\\sigma_0>0$ such\nthat vanishing happens when $\\sigma\\in (0,\\sigma_0)$, borderline spreading\nhappens when $\\sigma=\\sigma_0$, and spreading happens when $\\sigma>\\sigma_0$.\n"]}]

More specifically, we\ndevelop the schedulability and feasibility analysis modeling for the external\nmessages that may suffer release jitter due to being dispatched by a tick\ndriven scheduler in real-time control system and we also develop the\nscheduliablity modeling for sporadic activities, where messages arrive\nsporadically then execute periodically for some bounded time.

One of the challenging scheduling\nproblems in Cloud data centers is to take the allocation and migration of\nreconfigurable virtual machines (VMs) as well as the integrated features of\nhosting physical machines (PMs) into consideration. In the reservation model,\nthe workload of data centers has fixed process interval characteristics. In\ngeneral, load-balance scheduling is NP-hard problem as proved in many open\nliteratures. Traditionally, for offline load balance without migration, one of\nthe best approaches is LPT (Longest Process Time first), which is well known to\nhave approximation ratio 4/3. With virtualization, reactive (post) migration of\nVMs after allocation is one popular way for load balance and traffic\nconsolidation. However, reactive migration has difficulty to reach predefined\nload balance objectives, and may cause interruption and instability of service\nand other associated costs. In view of this, we propose a new paradigm, called\nPrepartition, it proactively sets process-time bound for each request on each\nPM and prepares in advance to migrate VMs to achieve the predefined balance\ngoal. Prepartition can reduce process time by preparing VM migration in advance\nand therefore reduce instability and achieve better load balance as desired. We\nalso apply the Prepartition to online (PrepartitionOn) load balance and compare\nit with existing online scheduling algorithms.

Here, by\ncharacterization of the network structure with synchronous measurement of the\nfibrin storage and loss moduli at increasing degrees of compression, we show\nthat the compressive behavior of fibrin networks is similar to that of cellular\nsolids. A non-linear stress-strain response of fibrin consists of three\nregimes: 1) an initial linear regime, in which most fibers are straight, 2) a\nplateau regime, in which more and more fibers buckle and collapse, and 3) a\nmarkedly non-linear regime, in which network densification occurs {{by bending\nof buckled fibers}} and inter-fiber contacts. Importantly, the spatially\nnon-uniform network deformation included formation of a moving \"compression\nfront\" along the axis of strain, which segregated the fibrin network into\ncompartments with different fiber densities and structure. The Young's modulus\nof the linear phase depends quadratically on the fibrin volume fraction while\nthat in the densified phase depends cubically on it. The viscoelastic plateau\nregime corresponds to a mixture of these two phases in which the fractions of\nthe two phases change during compression.

In our approach, the count table and the occurrence lists store\ninformation about selected $q$-grams in addition to the individual characters.\nTwo variants are described, namely one using $O(n \\log^2 n)$ bits of space with\n$O(m + \\log m \\log \\log n)$ average query time, and one with linear space and\n$O(m \\log \\log n)$ average query time, where $n$ is the input text length and\n$m$ is the pattern length. We experimentally show that a significant speedup\ncan be achieved by operating on $q$-grams (albeit at the cost of very high\nspace requirements, hence the name \"bloated\").\n  In the category of keyword indexes we present the so-called split index,\nwhich can efficiently solve the $k$-mismatches problem, especially for 1 error.\nOur implementation in the C++ language is focused mostly on data compaction,\nwhich is beneficial for the search speed (by being cache friendly). We compare\nour solution with other algorithms and we show that it is faster when the\nHamming distance is used. Query times in the order of 1 microsecond were\nreported for one mismatch for a few-megabyte natural language dictionary on a\nmedium-end PC.\n  A minor contribution includes string sketches which aim to speed up\napproximate string comparison at the cost of additional space ($O(1)$ per\nstring). They can be used in the context of keyword indexes in order to deduce\nthat two strings differ by at least $k$ mismatches with the use of fast bitwise\noperations rather than an explicit verification.\n","Comment: Master's thesis, 107 pages"]}]

Unfortunately, known algorithms\nfor an expressive logic like MTL (Metric Temporal Logic) do not scale with\nrespect to two crucial dimensions: the length of the trace and the size of the\ntime interval for which logged events must be buffered to check satisfaction of\nthe specification. The former issue can be addressed by distributed and\nparallel trace checking algorithms that can take advantage of modern cloud\ncomputing and programming frameworks like MapReduce. Still, the latter issue\nremains open with current state-of-the-art approaches.\n  In this paper we address this memory scalability issue by proposing a new\nsemantics for MTL, called lazy semantics. This semantics can evaluate temporal\nformulae and boolean combinations of temporal-only formulae at any arbitrary\ntime instant. We prove that lazy semantics is more expressive than standard\npoint-based semantics and that it can be used as a basis for a correct\nparametric decomposition of any MTL formula into an equivalent one with\nsmaller, bounded time intervals. We use lazy semantics to extend our previous\ndistributed trace checking algorithm for MTL.

Ascertaining the identity\nof the devices is a key technical challenge that must be overcome to thwart the\nthreat of PUE attacks. Typically, detection of PUE attacks is done by\ninspecting the signals coming from all the devices in the system, and then\nusing these signals to form unique fingerprints for each device. Current\ndetection and fingerprinting approaches require certain conditions to hold in\norder to effectively detect attackers. Such conditions include the need for a\nsufficient amount of fingerprint data for users or the existence of both the\nattacker and the victim PU within the same time frame. These conditions are\nnecessary because current methods lack the ability to learn the behavior of\nboth SUs and PUs with time. In this paper, a novel transfer learning (TL)\napproach is proposed, in which abstract knowledge about PUs and SUs is\ntransferred from past time frames to improve the detection process at future\ntime frames. The proposed approach extracts a high level representation for the\nenvironment at every time frame. This high level information is accumulated to\nform an abstract knowledge database. The CR system then utilizes this database\nto accurately detect PUE attacks even if an insufficient amount of fingerprint\ndata is available at the current time frame. The dynamic structure of the\nproposed approach uses the final detection decisions to update the abstract\nknowledge database for future runs. Simulation results show that the proposed\nmethod can improve the performance with an average of 3.5% for only 10%\nrelevant information between the past knowledge and the current environment\nsignals.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, in Proceedings of IEEE 26th International\n  Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC), Hong\n  Kong, P.R.
