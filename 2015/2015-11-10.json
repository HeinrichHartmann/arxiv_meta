Evolving the Wigner function for open systems has proved challenging\nhowever; a variety of methods have been devised but suffer from being\ncumbersome and resource intensive. Here we present an efficient fast-Fourier\nmethod for evolving the Wigner function, that has a complexity of $O(N\\log N)$\nwhere $N$ is the size of the array storing the Wigner function. The efficiency,\nstability, and simplicity of this method allows us to simulate open system\ndynamics previously thought to be prohibitively expensive. As a demonstration\nwe simulate the dynamics of both one-particle and two-particle systems under\nvarious environmental interactions. For a single particle we also compare the\nresulting evolution with that of the classical Fokker-Planck and Koopman-von\nNeumann equations, and show that the environmental interactions induce the\nquantum-to-classical transition as expected. In the case of two interacting\nparticles we show that an environment interacting with one of the particles\nleads to the loss of coherence of the other.\n"]}]

In the first part, which is of more\nabstract nature, the notion of quasi boundary triples and associated Weyl\nfunctions is developed further in such a way that it can be applied to elliptic\nboundary value problems on non-smooth domains. A key feature is the extension\nof the boundary maps by continuity to the duals of certain range spaces, which\ndirectly leads to a description of all self-adjoint extensions of the\nunderlying symmetric operator with the help of abstract boundary values. In the\nsecond part of the paper a complete description is obtained of all self-adjoint\nrealizations of the Laplacian on bounded Lipschitz domains, as well as\nKre\\u{\\i}n type resolvent formulas and a spectral characterization in terms of\nenergy dependent Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps.

The methods developed build a bridge\nlinking geometric topology with iterated function systems and their attractors.\n  A method to model self-affine tiles by simple iterative systems is developed\nin order to study their topology.

A crucial\ningredient for this model is the maximum pinning force that the lattice can\nexert on the vortices, as this allows us to estimate the angular momentum that\ncan be exchanged during a glitch. In this paper we perform, for the first time,\na detailed and quantitative calculation of the pinning force \\emph{per unit\nlength} acting on a vortex immersed in the crust and resulting from the\nmesoscopic vortex-lattice interaction.

About 15 kpc north-east of this galaxy, a\nparticularly complex region is found: the so-called Outer Filament where\njet-cloud interactions have been proposed to occur. We investigate the presence\nof signatures of jet-ISM interaction by a detailed study of the kinematics of\nthe ionized gas, expanding on previous results obtained from the HI. We\nobserved two regions of the outer filament with VLT/VIMOS in the IFU observing\nmode. Emission from Hbeta and [OIII]4959,5007\\AA\\ is detected in both\npointings. We found two distinct kinematical components of ionized gas that\nwell match the kinematics of the nearby HI cloud. One component follows the\nregular kinematics of the rotating gas while the second shows similar\nvelocities to those of the nearby HI component thought to be disturbed by an\ninteraction with the radio jet. We suggest that the ionized and atomic gas are\npart of the same dynamical gas structure originating as result of the merger\nthat shaped Centaurus A and which is regularly rotating around Centaurus A as\nproposed by other authors. The gas (ionized and HI) with anomalous velocities\nis tracing the interaction of the Large-Scale radio Jet with the ISM,\nsuggesting that, although poorly collimated as structure, the jet is still\nactive. However, we can exclude that a strong shock is driving the ionization\nof the gas. It is likely that a combination of jet entrainment and\nphotoionization by the UV continuum from the central engine is needed in order\nto explain both the ionization and the kinematics of the gas in the Outer\nFilament.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, 1 table.

The characteristics of the spin-state parameters and\nangular momentum variations are extensively studied using numerical\nsimulations, which confirm those reported by \\citet{Takahashi2013}. The large\namplitude of Toutatis' precession is assumed to be responsible for its tumbling\nattitude as observed from Earth. Toutatis' angular momentum orientation is\ndetermined to be described by $\\lambda_{H}=180.2^{+0.2^\\circ}_{-0.3^\\circ}$ and\n$\\beta_{H}=-54.75^{+0.15^\\circ}_{-0.10^\\circ}$, implying that it has remained\nnearly unchanged for two decades. Furthermore, using Fourier analysis to\nexplore the change in the orientation of Toutatis' axes, we reveal that the two\nrotational periods are 5.38 and 7.40 days, respectively, consistent with the\nresults of the former investigation. Hence, our investigation provides a clear\nunderstanding of the state of the rotational dynamics of Toutatis.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables, accepted to MNRAS"]}]

The objective of the paper was to examine the\ninfluence of the dark sector on the gravitational collapse of an electrically\ncharged scalar field. A phantom scalar field was used as a model of dark energy\nin the system. Dark matter was modeled by a complex scalar field with a quartic\npotential, charged under a U(1)-gauge field. The dark components were coupled\nto the electrically charged scalar field via the exponential coupling and the\ngauge field-Maxwell field kinetic mixing, respectively.

During the collapse in the presence of\ndark energy dynamical wormholes and naked singularities were formed in emerging\nspacetimes. The wormhole throats were stabilized by the violation of the null\nenergy condition, which occurred due to a significant increase of a value of\nthe phantom scalar field function in its vicinity. The square of mass parameter\nof the dark matter scalar field potential controlled the formation of a Cauchy\nhorizon or wormhole throats in the spacetime.

Posner molecules, formed by binding such phosphate pairs with\nextracellular calcium ions, will inherit the nuclear spin entanglement. A\nmechanism for transporting Posner molecules into presynaptic neurons during a\n\"kiss and run\" exocytosis, which releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic\ncleft, is proposed. Quantum measurements can occur when a pair of Posner\nmolecules chemically bind and subsequently melt, releasing a shower of\nintra-cellular calcium ions that can trigger further neurotransmitter release\nand enhance the probability of post-synaptic neuron firing.

We evaluated the contextual information in four\ncontext-aware recommender systems. Different weights were assigned to each type\nof information. The empirical results demonstrated that topic hierarchies with\nthe combination of the two kinds of privileged information can provide better\nrecommendations.\n"]}]

Two types of\nimportant regenerating code have been constructed: the minimum storage\nregeneration (MSR) code and the minimum bandwidth regeneration (MBR) code.\nHowever, in hostile networks where adversaries can compromise storage nodes,\nthe storage capacity of the network can be significantly affected. In this\npaper, we propose two optimal constructions of regenerating codes through\nrate-matching that can combat against this kind of adversaries in hostile\nnetworks: 2-layer rate-matched regenerating code and $m$-layer rate-matched\nregenerating code. For the 2-layer code, we can achieve the optimal storage\nefficiency for given system requirements. Our comprehensive analysis shows that\nour code can detect and correct malicious nodes with higher storage efficiency\ncompared to the universally resilient regenerating code which is a\nstraightforward extension of regenerating code with error detection and\ncorrection capability. Then we propose the $m$-layer code by extending the\n2-layer code and achieve the optimal error correction efficiency by matching\nthe code rate of each layer's regenerating code.
