However, the\nfreedom in the choice of the functional forms of $f(R)$ gives rise to the\nproblem of how to constrain and break the degeneracy among these gravity\ntheories on theoretical and/or observational grounds. In this paper to proceed\nfurther with the investigation on the potentialities, difficulties and\nlimitations of $f(R)$ gravity, we examine the question as to whether the future\ndynamics can be used to break the degeneracy between $f(R)$ gravity theories by\ninvestigating the future dynamics of spatially homogeneous and isotropic dust\nflat models in two $f(R)$ gravity theories, namely the well known $f(R) = R +\n\\alpha R^{n}$ gravity and another by A.

To this end we perform a\ndetailed numerical study of the future dynamic of these flat model in these\ntheories taking into account the recent constraints on the cosmological\nparameters made by the Planck team. We show that besides being powerful for\ndiscriminating between $f(R)$ gravity theories, the future dynamics technique\ncan also be used to determine the fate of the Universe in the framework of\nthese $f(R)$ gravity theories. Moreover, there emerges from our numerical\nanalysis that if we do not invoke a dark energy component with\nequation-of-state parameter $\\omega < -1$ one still has dust flat FLRW solution\nwith a big rip, if gravity deviates from general relativity via $f(R) = R +\n\\alpha R^n $.

In the energy domain\nbetween 0 and 200 MeV, the integrated strength or depletion number is highly\nsensitive to the separation of the IPM orbit to the scattering continuum. This\nsensitivity is determined by the influence of the surface-absorption properties\nof the DOM self-energy. For an ab initio calculation employing the self-energy\nof the charge-dependent Bonn (CDBonn) interaction which only includes the\neffect of short-range correlations, no such sensitivity is obtained and a\ndepletion of 4% is predicted between 0 and 200 MeV irrespective of the orbit.\nThe ab initio spectral strength generated with the CDBonn interaction\napproaches the empirical DOM spectral strength at 200 MeV. Both spectral\ndistributions allow for an additional 3-5% of the strength at even higher\nenergies which is associated with the influence of short-range correlations. We\nsuggest that the non-local form of the DOM allows for an analysis of\nelastic-nucleon-scattering data that directly determines the depletion of bound\norbits. While obviously relevant for the analysis of elastic nucleon scattering\non stable targets, this conclusion holds equally well for experiments involving\nrare isotopes in inverse kinematics as well as experiments with electrons on\natoms or molecules.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review Letters"]}]

We aim to measure the\nturbulence in clusters of galaxies and compare the measurements to some of\ntheir structural and evolutionary properties. It is possible to measure the\nturbulence of the hot gas in clusters by estimating the velocity widths of\ntheir X-ray emission lines. The RGS Spectrometers aboard XMM-Newton are\ncurrently the only instruments provided with sufficient effective area and\nspectral resolution in this energy domain. We benefited from excellent 1.6Ms\nnew data provided by the CHEERS project. The new observations improve the\nquality of the archival data and allow us to place constraints for some\nclusters, which were not accessible in previous work. One-half of the sample\nshows upper limits on turbulence less than 500km/s. For several sources, our\ndata are consistent with relatively strong turbulence with upper limits on the\nvelocity widths that are larger than 1000km/s. The NGC507 group of galaxies\nshows transonic velocities, which are most likely associated with the merging\nphenomena and bulk motions occurring in this object. Where both low- and\nhigh-ionization emission lines have good enough statistics, we find larger\nupper limits for the hot gas, which is partly due to the different spatial\nextents of the hot and cool gas phases. Our upper limits are larger than the\nMach numbers required to balance cooling, suggesting that dissipation of\nturbulence may prevent cooling, although other heating processes could be\ndominant. The systematics associated with the spatial profile of the source\ncontinuum make this technique very challenging, though still powerful, for\ncurrent instruments. The ASTRO-H and Athena missions will revolutionize the\nvelocity estimates and discriminate between different spatial regions and\ntemperature phases.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 18 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publications in\n  Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

As an experimentally controlled process, it is a key\ntool for the realization of quantum technologies. In particular, in an\natom/photon based quantum network scenario, in which localized atomic particles\nare used as quantum information processing nodes while photons are used as\ncarriers of quantum information between distant nodes, controlling both\nemission and absorption of single photons by single atoms is required for\nquantum coherent state mapping between the two entities. Most experimental\nefforts to date have focused on establishing the control of single photon\nemission by single trapped atoms, and the implementation of quantum networking\nprotocols using this interaction. In this chapter, we describe experimental\nefforts to control the process of single photon absorption by single trapped\nions. We describe a series of experiments in which polarization entangled\nphoton pairs, generated by a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source, are\ncoupled to a single ion. First the source is operated to generate heralded\nsingle photons, and coincidences between the absorption event of one photon of\nthe pair and the detection of the heralding partner photon are observed. We\nthen show how polarization control in the process is established, leading to\nthe manifestation of the photonic polarization entanglement in the absorption\nprocess. Finally, we introduce protocols in which this interaction scheme is\nharnessed to perform tasks in a quantum network, such as entanglement\ndistribution among distant nodes of the network, and we demonstrate a specific\nprotocol for heralded, high-fidelity photon-to-atom quantum state transfer.\n","Comment: to appear as a book chapter in a compilation \"Engineering the\n  Atom-Photon Interaction\" published by Springer in 2015, edited by A.\n  Predojevic and M.

This does not\nonly concern 'big' Linux servers acting as a router but more and more small and\nmedium network access devices, such as DSL or cable access devices.\n  Although there are a lot of documents dealing with high performance routing\nwith GNU/Linux, only a few offer experimental results to prove the given\nadvices. This study evaluates the throughput performance of Linux' routing\nsubsystem netfilter under various conditions like different data transport\nprotocols in combination with different IP address families and transmission\nstrategies. Those conditions were evaluated with two different types of\nnetfilter rules for a high number in the rule tables. In addition to this, our\nexperiments allowed us to evaluate two prominent client connection handling\ntechniques (threads and the epoll() facility).\n  The evaluation of the 1.260 different combinations of our test parameters\nshows a nearly linear but small throughput loss with the number of rules which\nis independant from the transport protocol and framesize. However, this\nevaluation identifies another issue concerning the throughput loss when it\ncomes to the address family, i.e. IPv4 and IPv6.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"]}]

The observed behavior\nof antineutron-nucleus annihilations is similar to what would be expected for\nantiproton-nucleus annihilations, where Coulomb attraction focusses antiproton\ntrajectories towards the nucleus, enhancing the inelastic cross section by a\nfactor O(1/p) with respect to antineutrons on the same target.

We show that for fixed Planck\nconstant, a com-plete scattering theory is available, showing that both the\npotential and the nonlinearity are asymptotically negligible for large time.\nThen, for data under the form of coherent state, we show that a scattering\ntheory is also available for the approximate envelope of the propagated\ncoherent state, which is given by a nonlinear equation. In the semi-classical\nlimit, these two scattering operators can be compared in terms of classical\nscattering the-ory, thanks to a uniform in time error estimate. Finally, we\ninfer a large time decoupling phenomenon in the case of finitely many initial\ncoherent states.\n","Comment: 41 pages"]}]

In analogy with GR, the bound is\ncorrelated with the absence of Galileon Duality (i.e. Diffeomorphism) invariant\nlocal observables.
