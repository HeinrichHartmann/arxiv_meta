Random forests are an\nensemble learning method for classification and regression that constructs a\nnumber of randomized decision trees during the training phase and predicts by\naveraging the results. Since its publication in the seminal paper of Breiman\n(2001), the procedure has become a major data analysis tool, that performs well\nin practice in comparison with many standard methods. What has greatly\ncontributed to the popularity of forests is the fact that they can be applied\nto a wide range of prediction problems and have few parameters to tune. Aside\nfrom being simple to use, the method is generally recognized for its accuracy\nand its ability to deal with small sample sizes, high-dimensional feature\nspaces and complex data structures.

Unfortunately, many results have been\nnegative, establishing that a wide variety of problems require $\\Omega(n^2)$\nspace to solve. One of the few bright spots has been the development of\nsemi-streaming algorithms for a handful of graph problems -- these algorithms\nuse space $O(n\\cdot\\text{polylog}(n))$.\n  In the annotated data streaming model of Chakrabarti et al., a\ncomputationally limited client wants to compute some property of a massive\ninput, but lacks the resources to store even a small fraction of the input, and\nhence cannot perform the desired computation locally. The client therefore\naccesses a powerful but untrusted service provider, who not only performs the\nrequested computation, but also proves that the answer is correct.\n  We put forth the notion of semi-streaming algorithms for annotated graph\nstreams (semi-streaming annotation schemes for short). These are protocols in\nwhich both the client's space usage and the length of the proof are $O(n \\cdot\n\\text{polylog}(n))$. We give evidence that semi-streaming annotation schemes\nrepresent a substantially more robust solution concept than does the standard\nsemi-streaming model. On the positive side, we give semi-streaming annotation\nschemes for two dynamic graph problems that are intractable in the standard\nmodel: (exactly) counting triangles, and (exactly) computing maximum matchings.\nThe former scheme answers a question of Cormode. On the negative side, we\nidentify for the first time two natural graph problems (connectivity and\nbipartiteness in a certain edge update model) that can be solved in the\nstandard semi-streaming model, but cannot be solved by annotation schemes of\n\"sub-semi-streaming\" cost.

The question of whether a\ndescription of solution sets in reduced words as an indexed language is\npossible has been been open for some years, apparently without much hope that a\npositive answer could hold. Nevertheless, our answer goes far beyond: they are\nEDT0L, which is a proper subclass of indexed languages. We can additionally\nhandle the existential theory of equations with rational constraints in free\nproducts $\\star_{1 \\leq i \\leq s}F_i$, where each $F_i$ is either a free or\nfinite group, or a free monoid with involution.

The emission is\nemerging from buried, compact (r<17-70 pc) nuclei that have very high implied\nmid-infrared surface brightness $>$$5\\times 10^{13}$ L$_{\\odot}$ kpc$^{-2}$.\nThese nuclei are likely powered by accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs)\nand/or hot (>200 K) extreme starbursts.

It is clear that these lines open\nup a new interesting avenue to gain access to the most obscured AGNs and\nstarbursts. Vibrationally excited HCN acts as a proxy for the absorbed\nmid-infrared emission from the embedded nuclei, which allows for reconstruction\nof the intrinsic, hotter dust SED. In contrast, we show strong evidence that\nthe ground vibrational state ($\\nu$=0), J=3-2 and 4-3 rotational lines of HCN\nand HCO$^+$ fail to probe the highly enshrouded, compact nuclear regions owing\nto strong self- and continuum absorption. The HCN and HCO$^+$ line profiles are\ndouble-peaked because of the absorption and show evidence of non-circular\nmotions - possibly in the form of in- or outflows. Detections of vibrationally\nexcited HCN in external galaxies are so far limited to ULIRGs and early-type\nspiral LIRGs, and we discuss possible causes for this. We tentatively suggest\nthat the peak of vibrationally excited HCN emission is connected to a rapid\nstage of nuclear growth, before the phase of strong feedback.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

Initially, sensors obtain inaccurate estimations of an external time\nreference and subsequently collaborate in order to synchronize their internal\nclocks with the external time. For simplicity, we adopt the drift-free\nassumption, where internal clocks are assumed to tick at the same pace. Hence,\nthe problem is reduced to an estimation problem, in which the sensors need to\nestimate the initial external time. This work is further relevant to the\nproblem of collective approximation of environmental values by biological\ngroups.\n  Unlike most works on clock synchronization that assume static networks, this\npaper focuses on an extreme case of highly dynamic networks. Specifically, we\nassume a non-adaptive scheduler adversary that dictates in advance an\narbitrary, yet independent, meeting pattern. Such meeting patterns fit, for\nexample, with short-time scenarios in highly dynamic settings, where each\nsensor interacts with only few other arbitrary sensors.\n  We propose an extremely simple clock synchronization algorithm that is based\non weighted averages, and prove that its performance on any given independent\nmeeting pattern is highly competitive with that of the best possible algorithm,\nwhich operates without any resource or computational restrictions, and knows\nthe meeting pattern in advance. In particular, when all distributions involved\nare Gaussian, the performances of our scheme coincide with the optimal\nperformances. Our proofs rely on an extensive use of the concept of Fisher\ninformation. We use the Cramer-Rao bound and our definition of a Fisher Channel\nCapacity to quantify information flows and to obtain lower bounds on collective\nperformance.

When the marginal\nprobability measures are absolutely continuous (or vanish on small sets) the\ntheory of Wasserstein barycenters is well-developed (see the seminal paper\n[1]). However, exact continuous computation of Wasserstein barycenters in this\nsetting is tractable in only a small number of specialized cases. Moreover, in\nmany applications data is given as a set of probability measures with finite\nsupport. In this paper, we develop theoretical results for Wasserstein\nbarycenters in this discrete setting. Our results rely heavily on polyhedral\ntheory which is possible due to the discrete structure of the marginals.\n  Our results closely mirror those in the continuous case with a few\nexceptions. In this discrete setting we establish that Wasserstein barycenters\nmust also be discrete measures and there is always a barycenter which is\nprovably sparse. Moreover, for each Wasserstein barycenter there exists a\nnon-mass-splitting optimal transport to each of the discrete marginals. Such\nnon-mass-splitting transports do not generally exist between two discrete\nmeasures unless special mass balance conditions hold.

This is the case\nin particular in the presence of lateral genetic transfer (LGT), whereby a gene\nis inherited from a distant species rather than an immediate ancestor. Such an\nevent produces a gene tree which is distinct from (but related to) the species\nphylogeny.\n  In previous work, a stochastic model of LGT was introduced and it was shown\nthat the species phylogeny can be reconstructed from gene trees despite\nsurprisingly high rates of LGT. Both lower and upper bounds on this rate were\nobtained, but a large gap remained. Here we close this gap, up to a constant.\nSpecifically, we show that the species phylogeny can be reconstructed perfectly\neven when each edge of the tree has a constant probability of being the\nlocation of an LGT event. Our new reconstruction algorithm builds the tree\nrecursively from the leaves. We also provide a matching bound in the negative\ndirection (up to a constant).\n"]}]

In data mining classification is a\nsupervised learning that can be used to design models describing important data\nclasses, where class attribute is involved in the construction of the\nclassifier. Nearest neighbor (KNN) is very simple, most popular, highly\nefficient and effective algorithm for pattern recognition.KNN is a straight\nforward classifier, where samples are classified based on the class of their\nnearest neighbor.

In this paper, the fracture\nresistance of zigzag SWNTs with preexisting defects is calculated using\nfracture mechanics concepts based on atomistic simulations. The problem of\nunstable crack growth at finite temperature, presumably caused by lattice\ntrapping effect, is circumvented by computing the strain energy release rate\nthrough a series of displacement-controlled tensile loading of SWNTs (applied\nthrough moving the outermost layer of atoms at one end at constant strain rate\nof 9.4x10-4/ps) with pre-existing crack-like defects of various lengths. The\nstrain energy release rate, G, is computed for (17,0), (28,0) and (35,0) SWNTs\n(each with aspect ratio 4) with pre-existing cracks up to 29.5{\\AA} long. The\nfracture resistance, Gc, is determined as a function of crack length for each\ntube at three different temperatures (1K, 300K and 500K). A significant\ndependence of Gc on crack length is observed reminiscent of the rising R curve\nbehavior of metals at the macroscale: for the zigzag nanotubes Gc increases\nwith crack length at small length, and tends to reach a constant value if the\ntube diameter is large enough. We suspect that the lattice trapping effect\nplays the role of crack tip plasticity at the atomic scale. For example, at 300\nKelvin, Gc for the (35,0) tube with aspect ratio 4 converges to 6 Joule/m2 as\nthe crack length exceeds 20 Angstrom. This value is comparable with the\nfracture toughness of graphite and Silicon. The fracture resistance of the\ntubes is found to decrease significantly as the temperature increases. To study\nthe length effects, the computations are repeated for zigzag nanotubes with the\nsame three chiralities but with aspect ratio 8 at 1K.\n"]}]

First, pointwise continuum fields are obtained using a\ngeneralization of the Irving-Kirkwood procedure to arbitrary multi-body\npotentials. Two ambiguities associated with the original Irving-Kirkwood\nprocedure (which was limited to pair potential interactions) are addressed in\nits generalization. The first ambiguity is due to the non-uniqueness of the\ndecomposition of the force on an atom as a sum of central forces, which is a\nresult of the non-uniqueness of the potential energy representation in terms of\ndistances between the particles. This is in turn related to the shape space of\nthe system. The second ambiguity is due to the non-uniqueness of the energy\ndecomposition between particles. The latter can be completely avoided through\nan alternate derivation for the energy balance. It is found that the\nexpressions for the specific internal energy and the heat flux obtained through\nthe alternate derivation are quite different from the original Irving-Kirkwood\nprocedure and appear to be more physically reasonable. Next, in the second step\nof the unified framework, spatial averaging is applied to the pointwise field\nto obtain the corresponding macroscopic quantities. These lead to expressions\nsuitable for computation in molecular dynamics simulations.

In the context of the finite volume\nmethod no single local refinement criterion has been globally established as\noptimum for the selection of the control volumes to subdivide, since it is not\neasy to associate the discretisation error with an easily computable quantity\nin each control volume. Often the grid refinement criterion is based on an\nestimate of the truncation error in each control volume, because the truncation\nerror is a natural measure of the discrepancy between the algebraic\nfinite-volume equations and the original differential equations. However, it is\nnot a straightforward task to associate the truncation error with the optimum\ngrid density because of the complexity of the relationship between truncation\nand discretisation errors. In the present work several criteria based on a\ntruncation error estimate are tested and compared on a regularised lid-driven\ncavity case at various Reynolds numbers. It is shown that criteria where the\ntruncation error is weighted by the volume of the grid cells perform better\nthan using just the truncation error as the criterion. Also it is observed that\nthe efficiency of local refinement increases with the Reynolds number. The\ntruncation error is estimated by restricting the solution to a coarser grid and\napplying the coarse grid discrete operator. The complication that high\ntruncation error develops at grid level interfaces is also investigated and\nseveral treatments are tested.\n"]}]
