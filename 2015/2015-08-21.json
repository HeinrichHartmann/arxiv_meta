An accurate theoretical modelling of their effect during\nthe non-linear regime of structure formation is required in order to properly\nanalyse current and upcoming high-precision large-scale structure data, and\nconstrain the neutrino mass. Taking advantage of the fact that massive\nneutrinos remain linearly clustered up to late times, this paper treats the\nlinear growth of neutrino overdensities in a non-linear CDM background. The\nevolution of the CDM component is obtained via N-body computations. The smooth\nneutrino component is evaluated from that background by solving the Boltzmann\nequation linearised with respect to the neutrino overdensity. CDM and neutrinos\nare simultaneously evolved in time, consistently accounting for their mutual\ngravitational influence. This method avoids the issue of shot-noise inherent to\nparticle-based neutrino simulations, and, in contrast with standard\nFourier-space methods, properly accounts for the non-linear potential wells in\nwhich the neutrinos evolve. Inside the most massive late-time clusters, where\nthe escape velocity is larger than the neutrino thermal velocity, neutrinos can\nclump non-linearly, causing the method to formally break down.

By highlighting the main advantages and drawbacks\nof the available approaches in the literature, a choice is made in terms of\nmodelling: a Fokker-Planck-like filtered kinetic equation proposed by Zaichik\net al. 2009 and a Kinetic-Based Moment Method (KBMM) based on a Gaussian\nclosure for the NDF proposed by Vie et al. 2014. The resulting Euler-like\nsystem of equations is able to reproduce the dynamics of particles for small to\nmoderate Stokes number flows, given a LES model for the gaseous phase, and is\nrepresentative of the generic difficulties of such models. Indeed, it\nencounters strong constraints in terms of numerics in the small Stokes number\nlimit, which can lead to a degeneracy of the accuracy of standard numerical\nmethods. These constraints are: 1/as the resulting sound speed is inversely\nproportional to the Stokes number, it is highly CFL-constraining, and 2/the\nsystem tends to an advection-diffusion limit equation on the number density\nthat has to be properly approximated by the designed scheme used for the whole\nrange of Stokes numbers. Then, the present work proposes a numerical scheme\nthat is able to handle both. Relying on the ideas introduced in a different\ncontext by Chalons et al. 2013: a Lagrange-Projection, a relaxation formulation\nand a HLLC scheme with source terms, we extend the approach to a singular flux\nas well as properly handle the energy equation. The final scheme is proven to\nbe Asymptotic-Preserving on 1D cases comparing to either converged or\nanalytical solutions and can easily be extended to multidimensional\nconfigurations, thus setting the path for realistic applications.\n"]}]

At\ntemperature greater than 25K, the field induced FM Pnma phase remained\nirreversible even after complete removal of field. However, for T ( 39-65K),\nthe field induced transformation is partially reversible. This behaviour has\nbeen attributed to magnetic field induced devitrification of the glass-like\narrested AFM P21/m phase to FM Pnma equilibrium phase. The devitrified FM Pnma\nphase starts transforming back to AFM P21/m phase around ~39K on heating the\nsample under zero field. Our results corroborate the evidence of strong\nmagneto-structural coupling in this system. An H-T phase-diagram has been\nconstructed based on LTHM-XTD data, which resembles with the one made from\nmagnetic measurements. These results have been explained on the basis of\nkinetic arrest of first order phase transition and field induced\ndevitrification of the arrested phase.\n","Comment: 16pages, 6 figures, ON page no 5, line number 16 has been modified\n  as, \"The FM Pnma phase transforms back to AFM P21/m phase on heating\""]}]

In this paper, we study the relationship between executable behaviour\nand behaviour that can be specified in the pi-calculus. We establish that all\nexecutable behaviour can be specified in the pi-calculus up to\ndivergence-preserving branching bisimilarity. The converse, however, is not\ntrue due to (intended) limitations of the model of reactive Turing machines.\nThat is, the pi-calculus allows the specification of behaviour that is not\nexecutable up to divergence-preserving branching bisimilarity. Motivated by an\nintuitive understanding of executability, we then consider a restriction on the\noperational semantics of the pi-calculus that does associate with every pi-term\nexecutable behaviour, at least up to the version of branching bisimilarity that\ndoes not require the preservation of divergence.\n","Comment: In Proceedings ICE 2015, arXiv:1508.04595. arXiv admin note:\n  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1410.4512"]}]

To this end, we first present a general strategy extending a\nfirst-principles approach based on projections onto slow variables (so far\nrestricted to strictly homogeneous flow) in order to handle inhomogeneities. In\nparticular, we separate the advection of the microstructure by the flow, at the\norigin of a fluctuation advection term, from the intrinsic dynamics.

The model properly accounts for the shear-thinning properties of\nthe dispersions, but, owing to the approximations, the description is not fully\nquantitative. Finally, we perform a linear stability analysis of the flow in\nthe experimentally relevant cylindrical (Taylor-Couette) geometry and provide\nevidence that shear-thinning strongly stabilises the flow, which can explain\nwhy visco-elastic instabilities are not observed in dense colloidal\nsuspensions.\n"]}]

An even harder\nproblem is to find characterizations of families of cyclic codes in terms of\ntheir weight distributions. On the other hand, it is also well known that\ncyclic codes with few weights have a great practical importance in coding\ntheory and cryptography. In particular, cyclic codes having three nonzero\nweights have been studied by several authors, however, most of these efforts\nfocused on cyclic codes over a prime field. In this work we present a\ncharacterization of a class of optimal three-weight cyclic codes of dimension 3\nover any finite field. The codes under this characterization are, indeed,\noptimal in the sense that their lengths reach the Griesmer lower bound for\nlinear codes. Consequently, these codes reach, simultaneously, the best\npossible coding capacity, and also the best possible capabilities of error\ndetection and correction for linear codes. But because they are cyclic in\nnature, they also possess a rich algebraic structure that can be utilized in a\nvariety of ways, particularly, in the design of very efficient coding and\ndecoding algorithms. What is also worth pointing out, is the simplicity of the\nnecessary and sufficient numerical conditions that characterize our class of\noptimal three-weight cyclic codes. As we already pointed out, it is a hard\nproblem to find this kind of characterizations. However, for this particular\ncase the fundamental tool that allowed us to find our characterization was the\ncharacterization for all two-weight irreducible cyclic codes that was\nintroduced by B. Schmidt and C. White (2002). Lastly, another feature about the\ncodes in this class, is that their duals seem to have always the same\nparameters as the best known linear codes.\n","Comment: Preprint submitted to Finite Fields and Their Applications August 20,\n  2015"]}]
