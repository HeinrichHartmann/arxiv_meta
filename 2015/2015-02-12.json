In\naddition to causality, the following postulates have been considered: PFAITH\n(existence of a pure preparationally faithful state), and FAITHE (existence of\na faithful effect). These postulates have exhibited an unexpected theoretical\npower, excluding all known nonquantum probabilistic theories. Later in Ref. [2]\nin addition to causality and PFAITH, postulate LDISCR (local discriminability)\nand PURIFY (purifiability of all states) have been considered, narrowing the\nprobabilistic theory to something very close to Quantum Mechanics. In the\npresent paper we test the above postulates on some nonquantum probabilistic\nmodels. The first model, \"the two-box world\" is an extension of the\nPopescu-Rohrlich model, which achieves the greatest violation of the CHSH\ninequality compatible with the no-signaling principle.

Despite this focus, known\nEGPs populate a continuum of orbital separations from canonical hot Jupiter\nvalues (0.03-0.05 AU) out to 1 AU and beyond. Unlike typical hot Jupiters,\nthese more distant EGPs will not in general be synchronously rotating. In\nanticipation of observations of this population, we here present\nthree-dimensional atmospheric circulation models exploring the dynamics that\nemerge over a broad range of rotation rates and incident stellar fluxes\nappropriate for warm and hot Jupiters. We find that the circulation resides in\none of two basic regimes. On typical hot Jupiters, the strong day-night heating\ncontrast leads to a broad, fast superrotating (eastward) equatorial jet and\nlarge day-night temperature differences. At faster rotation rates and lower\nincident fluxes, however, the day-night heating gradient becomes less\nimportant, and baroclinic instabilities emerge as a dominant player, leading to\neastward jets in the midlatitudes, minimal temperature variations in longitude,\nand, in many cases, weak winds at the equator. Our most rapidly rotating and\nleast irradiated models exhibit multiple eastward jets in each\nhemisphere--similar to the jets on Jupiter and Saturn--and illuminate the\ndynamical continuum between highly irradiated EGPs and the weakly irradiated\ngiant planets of our own Solar System. We present infrared (IR) light curves\nand spectra of these models, which show that the amplitude and offset of the IR\nphase variation, as well as the shape of the spectra, depend significantly on\nincident flux and rotation rate. This provides a way to identify the regime\ntransition in future observations and suggests that, in some cases, IR light\ncurves can provide constraints on the rotation rate of non-synchronously\nrotating planets.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 11 figures, revised version.

The famous paradoxes of quantum\ntheory, the mysterious nature of measurements in quantum theory and the\nprincipal no-go theorems for hidden variables are first briefly reviewed. The\nKoopman-von Neumann Hilbert space theory based on complex wave functions\nunderlying particle trajectories in classical phase space, is an important step\nforward in that direction. It provides a clear and beautiful harmony of\nclassical waves and particles. Sudarshan has given an alternative but\nequivalent formulation that shows that classical mechanics can be regarded as a\nquantum theory with essentially hidden non-commuting variables. An extension of\nKvNS theory to classical electrodynamics provides a sound Hilbert space\nfoundation to it and satisfactorily accounts for entanglement and\nBell-CHSH-like violations already observed in classical polarization optics. An\nimportant new insight that has been obtained through these developments is that\nentanglement and Bell-like inequality violations are neither unique signatures\nof quantumness nor of non-locality---they are rather signatures of\nnon-separability. Finally, Sudarshan's proposed solution to the measurement\nproblem using KvNS theory for the measuring apparatus is sketched to show to\nwhat extent wave and particles can be harmonized in quantum theory.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 3 figures; Journal of Advanced Physics, special issue on\n  \"Tests of Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\", 2015"]}]

The strong galactic gravitational field makes this impossible on\nenergetic grounds. It is shown that if only short pieces of the undesirable\nfield lines are expelled, then mass can flow down along these field lines\nwithout requiring much energy. This expulsion of only short lines of force can\nbe accomplished by a spike instability associated with gigantic astrophysical\nsuperbubbles. The physics of this instability is discussed and the results\nenable an estimate to be made of the number of spikes in the galaxy. It appears\nthat there are probably enough spikes to cut all the undesirable lines into\npieces as short as a couple of kiloparsecs during a dynamo time of a billion\nyears. These cut pieces then may be randomly rotated in a dynamo time by\nalpha-Omega diffusion and there is enough rotation to get rid of the\nundesirable flux without expelling the fields themselves. The spike process\nseems strong enough to allows the alpha-Omega dynamo to create the galactic\nfield without any trouble from the boundary condition problem.\n","Comment: submitted to Physics of Plasmas"]}]

Large bubbles grow at the expenses\nof smaller ones. The smaller the bubble, the faster it shrinks. As the number\nof bubbles in a given volume decreases in time, the average bubble size\nincreases: i.e. the foam coarsens. During coarsening, bubbles also move\nrelative to each other, changing bubble topology and shape, while liquid moves\nwithin the regions separating the bubbles. Analyzing the combined effects of\nthese mechanisms requires examining a volume with enough bubbles to provide\nappropriate statistics throughout coarsening.

But do all extensive-form games correspond to\nprotocols that we can implement in the real world? We often rule out games with\nimperfect recall, which prescribe that an agent forget something that she knew\nbefore. In this paper, we show that even some games with perfect recall can be\nproblematic to implement. Specifically, we show that if the agents have a sense\nof time passing (say, access to a clock), then some extensive-form games can no\nlonger be implemented; no matter how we attempt to time the game, some\ninformation will leak to the agents that they are not supposed to have. We say\nsuch a game is not exactly timeable. We provide easy-to-check necessary and\nsufficient conditions for a game to be exactly timeable. Most of the technical\ndepth of the paper concerns how to approximately time games, which we show can\nalways be done, though it may require large amounts of time. Specifically, we\nshow that for some games the time required to approximately implement the game\ngrows as a power tower of height proportional to the number of players and with\na parameter that measures the precision of the approximation at the top of the\npower tower. In practice, that makes the games untimeable.

We first enlarge the Hilbert space with adding a tail on one of the\nedges of each trivalent vertex, to describe its internal charge degrees of\nfreedom. Then we study the full dyon spectrum of generalized LW models,\nincluding both quantum numbers and wave functions for dyonic quasiparticle\nexcitations. The local operators associated with the dyonic excitations are\nshown to form the so-called Tube algebra, whose representations (modules) form\nthe quantum double (categoric center) of the input data (unitary fusion\ncategory). In physically relevant cases, the input data is from a finite or\nquantum group (with braiding $R$-matrices), we find that the elementary\nexcitations (or dyon species), as well as any localized/isolated excited\nstates, are characterized by three quantum numbers: charge, fluxon type, and\ntwist.
