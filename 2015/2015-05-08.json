In the focus of this paper\nlies a simplicial complex K_P which carries complete information about the\ncombinatorial type of P. In the case when P is simple, K_P is the same as dP*,\nwhere P* is a polar dual polytope. Using the canonical embedding of a polytope\nP into nonnegative orthant, we introduce a moment-angle space Z_P for a\npolytope P. It is known, that in the case when P is simple the space Z_P is\nhomeomorphic to the polyhedral product (D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. When P is not simple,\nwe prove that the space Z_P is homotopically equivalent to the space\n(D^2,S^1)^{K_P}. This allows to introduce bigraded Betti numbers for any convex\npolytope. A Stanley-Reisner ring of a polytope P can be defined as a\nStanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex K_P. All these considerations lead\nto a natural question: which simplicial complexes arise as K_P for some\npolytope P? We have proceeded in this direction by introducing a notion of a\npolytopic simplicial complex. It has the following property: link of each\nsimplex in a polytopic complex is either contractible, or retractible to a\nsubcomplex, homeomorphic to a sphere. The complex K_P is a polytopic simplicial\ncomplex for any polytope P. Links of so called face simplices in a polytopic\ncomplex are polytopic complexes as well. This fact is sufficient enough to\nconnect face polynomial of a simplicial complex K_P to the face polynomial of a\npolytope P, giving a series of inequalities on certain combinatorial\ncharacteristics of P. Two of these inequalities are equalities for each P and\nrepresent Euler-Poincare formula and one of Bayer-Billera relations for flag\nf-numbers. In the case when P is simple all inequalities turn out to be\nclassical Dehn-Sommerville relations.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 5 figures. A few typos were removed in the third version"]}]

Using this model, the\ndependences of SRNs on the cosmic star formation rate density, shock revival\ntime and equation of state are investigated. The shock revival time is\nintroduced as a parameter that should depend on the still unknown explosion\nmechanism of core collapse supernovae. The dependence on equation of state is\nconsidered for failed supernovae, whose collapse dynamics and neutrino emission\nare certainly affected. It is found that the low-energy spectrum of SRNs is\nmainly determined by the cosmic star formation rate density.

This projection is achieved by\niteratively projecting onto each of the convex sets individually, following\nDyktra's scheme. The sequence thus obtained is guaranteed to converge to the\nsought projection. Thanks to the preliminary matrix decomposition and variable\nsubstitution, the projection is implemented intrinsically in a subspace, whose\ndimension is very often much lower than the number of bands. A benefit of this\nstrategy is that the order of the computational complexity for each projection\nis decreased from quadratic to linear time.

These extended features, called magnetic tongues,\nare interpreted as a consequence of the azimuthal component of the magnetic\nflux in the toroidal flux-tubes that form ARs. We develop a new systematic and\nuser-independent method to identify AR tongues. Our method is based on\ndetermining and analyzing the evolution of the AR main polarity inversion line\n(PIL). The effect of the tongues is quantified by measuring the acute angle [\ntau] between the orientation of the PIL and the direction orthogonal to the AR\nmain bipolar axis. We apply a simple model to simulate the emergence of a\nbipolar AR. This model lets us interpret the effect of magnetic tongues on\nparameters that characterize ARs ( e.g. the PIL inclination and the tilt\nangles, and their evolution). In this idealized kinematic emergence model, tau\nis a monotonically increasing function of the twist and has the same sign as\nthe magnetic helicity. We systematically apply our procedure to a set of\nbipolar ARs that were observed emerging in line-of-sight magnetograms over\neight years. For most of the cases studied, the tongues only have a small\ninfluence on the AR tilt angle since tongues have a much lower magnetic flux\nthan the more concentrated main polarities. From the observed evolution of tau,\ncorrected for the temporal evolution of the tilt angle and its final value when\nthe AR is fully emerged, we estimate the average number of turns in the\nsubphotospherically emerging flux-rope. These values for the 41 observed ARs\nare below unity, except for one. This indicates that subphotospheric flux-ropes\ntypically have a low amount of twist, i.e. highly twisted flux-tubes are rare.\nOur results demonstrate that the evolution of the PIL is a robust indicator of\nthe presence of tongues and constrains the amount of twist in emerging\nflux-tubes\n"]}]
