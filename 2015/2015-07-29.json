When the feedback is\ninstantaneous, solutions approach a self-limiting equilibrium state. When there\nis a delay, even though the feedback is negative, the solutions can exhibit\ncyclic and episodic solutions. We find that periodic or episodic star formation\nonly occurs when two conditions are satisfied. Firstly the delay timescale must\nexceed a cloud consumption timescale. Secondly the feedback must be strong.\nThis statement is quantitatively equivalent to requiring that the timescale to\napproach equilibrium be greater than approximately twice the cloud consumption\ntimescale. The period of oscillations predicted is approximately 4 times the\ndelay timescale. The amplitude of the oscillations increases with both feedback\nstrength and delay time.\n  We discuss applications of the delay differential equation (DDE) model to\nstar formation in galaxies using the cloud density as a variable. The DDE model\nis most applicable to systems that recycle gas and only slowly remove gas from\nthe system.

The standard model of an average\neconomic agent predicts that fluctuations are reduced by such an adaptive\npricing mechanism.\n  However, the underlying assumption that the actions of all agents average out\non the time axis is not always true in a market of many agents. We numerically\nstudy an econophysics agent model of an adaptive power market that does not\nassume averaging a priori. We find that when agents are exposed to source noise\nvia correlated price fluctuations (as adaptive pricing schemes suggest), the\nmarket may amplify those fluctuations.

Our analysis is based on Gupta and Kumar {\\em protocol model} for the\nunderlying D2D wireless network, widely used in the literature on capacity\nscaling laws of wireless networks without caching. Our results show that the\ncombination of D2D spectrum reuse and caching at the user nodes yields a\nper-user throughput independent of the number of users, for any fixed outage\nprobability in $(0,1)$. This implies that the D2D caching network is\n\"scalable\": even though the number of users increases, each user achieves\nconstant throughput. This behavior is very different from the classical Gupta\nand Kumar result on ad-hoc wireless networks, for which the per-user throughput\nvanishes as the number of users increases. Furthermore, we show that the user\nthroughput is directly proportional to the fraction of cached information over\nthe whole file library size. Therefore, we can conclude that D2D caching\nnetworks can turn \"memory\" into \"bandwidth\" (i.e., doubling the on-board cache\nmemory on the user devices yields a 100\\% increase of the user throughout).\n","Comment: 58 pages, 8 figures, Revised version of the manuscript submitted to\n  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, This is the extended version of the\n  conference (ISIT) paper arXiv:1302.2168"]}]

They further claim that such a theory carries another\nhidden symmetry; a global SO(1,1) symmetry. By deforming around the global\nSO(1,1) symmetry, they are able to produce a range of inflationary models with\nasymptotically flat potentials, whose flatness is claimed to be protected by\nthese symmetries. These models tend to give rise to B-modes with small\namplitude. Here we explain that these authors are merely introducing a\nredundancy into the description, not an actual conformal symmetry. Furthermore,\nwe explain that the only real (global) symmetry in these models is not at all\nhidden, but is completely manifest when expressed in the Einstein frame; it is\nin fact the shift symmetry of a scalar field. When analyzed systematically as\nan effective field theory, deformations do not generally produce asymptotically\nflat potentials and small B-modes, but other types of potentials with B-modes\nof appreciable amplitude. Such simple models typically also produce the\nobserved red spectral index, Gaussian fluctuations, etc. In short: simple\nmodels of inflation, organized by expanding around a shift symmetry, are in\nexcellent agreement with recent data.\n","Comment: 9 pages in double column format.

Their strength arises from a small divisor from the distance to the\nfirst-order resonances and insensitivity to eccentricity, which make up for\ntheir dependence on moon mass. Three-body resonances associated with\nlow-integer Laplace angles can also be comparatively strong due to the many\nmultiples of the angle contributed from Fourier components of the interaction\nterms. We attribute small coupled variations in semi-major axis, seen\nthroughout the simulation, to ubiquitous and weak three-body resonant\ncouplings. We show that a system with two pairs of bodies in first-order\nmean-motion resonance can be transformed to resemble the well-studied\nperiodically-forced pendulum with the frequency of a Laplace angle serving as a\nperturbation frequency. We identify trios of bodies and overlapping pairs of\ntwo-body resonances in each trio that have particularly short estimated\nLyapunov timescales.\n"]}]

We\nstudy the role that star formation and AGN feedback have in launching and\nmaintaining the molecular outflows in two starburst-dominated advanced mergers,\nNGC1614 and IRAS17208-0014, by analyzing the distribution and kinematics of\ntheir molecular gas reservoirs. We have used the PdBI array to image with high\nspatial resolution (0.5\"-1.2\") the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) line emissions in\nNGC1614 and IRAS17208-0014, respectively. The velocity fields of the gas are\nanalyzed and modeled to find the evidence of molecular outflows in these\nsources and characterize the mass, momentum and energy of these components.\nWhile most (>95%) of the CO emission stems from spatially-resolved\n(~2-3kpc-diameter) rotating disks, we also detect in both mergers the emission\nfrom high-velocity line wings that extend up to +-500-700km/s, well beyond the\nestimated virial range associated with rotation and turbulence. The kinematic\nmajor axis of the line wing emission is tilted by ~90deg in NGC1614 and by\n~180deg in IRAS17208-0014 relative to their respective rotating disk major\naxes. These results can be explained by the existence of non-coplanar molecular\noutflows in both systems. In stark contrast with NGC1614, where star formation\nalone can drive its molecular outflow, the mass, energy and momentum budget\nrequirements of the molecular outflow in IRAS17208-0014 can be best accounted\nfor by the existence of a so far undetected (hidden) AGN of L_AGN~7x10^11\nL_sun. The geometry of the molecular outflow in IRAS17208-0014 suggests that\nthe outflow is launched by a non-coplanar disk that may be associated with a\nburied AGN in the western nucleus.\n","Comment: Final version in press, accepted by A&A.

Tidal dissipation in stellar\nconvective envelopes is a key actor that shapes the orbital architecture of\nshort-period systems. Our objective is to understand and evaluate how tidal\ndissipation in the convective envelope of low-mass stars (from M to F types)\ndepends on their mass, evolutionary stage and rotation. Using a simplified\ntwo-layer assumption, we compute analytically the frequency-averaged tidal\ndissipation in their convective envelope. This dissipation is due to the\nconversion into heat of the kinetic energy of tidal non wave-like/equilibrium\nflow and inertial waves because of the viscous friction applied by turbulent\nconvection. Using grids of stellar models allows us to study the variation of\nthe dissipation as a function of stellar mass and age on the Pre-Main-Sequence\nand on the Main-Sequence for stars with masses spanning from $0.4$ to\n$1.4M_{\\odot}$. As shown by observations, tidal dissipation in stars varies\nover several orders of magnitude as a function of stellar mass, age and\nrotation. During their Pre-Main-Sequence, all low-mass stars have an increase\nof the frequency-averaged tidal dissipation for a fixed angular velocity in\ntheir convective envelope until they reach a critical aspect and mass ratios.\nNext, the dissipation evolves on the Main Sequence to an asymptotic value that\nbecomes maximum for $0.6M_{\\odot}$ K-type stars and that decreases by several\norders of magnitude with increasing stellar mass. Finally, the rotational\nevolution of low-mass stars strengthens the importance of tidal dissipation\nduring the Pre-Main-Sequence for star-planet and multiple star systems.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication as a Letter in Astronomy\n  & Astrophysics"]}]

Reconnection is as ubiquitous as plasmas themselves,\nwith solar flares perhaps the most popular example. Over the last few years,\nthe theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnection in large-scale fluid\nsystems has undergone a major paradigm shift. The steady-state model of\nreconnection described by the famous Sweet-Parker (SP) theory, which dominated\nthe field for ~50 years, has been replaced with an essentially time-dependent,\nbursty picture of the reconnection layer, dominated by the continuous formation\nand ejection of multiple secondary islands (plasmoids). Whereas in the SP model\nreconnection was predicted to be slow, a major implication of this new paradigm\nis that reconnection in fluid systems is fast (i.e., independent of the\nLundquist number), provided that the system is large enough. This conceptual\nshift hinges on the realization that SP-like current layers are violently\nunstable to the plasmoid instability - implying, therefore, that such current\nsheets are super-critically unstable and thus can never form in the first\nplace. This suggests that the formation of a current sheet and the subsequent\nreconnection process cannot be decoupled, as is commonly assumed.

Via collisionless particle integration we\nnumerically find the location of the boundary of the chaotic zone in the\nplanet's corotation region. We find that the distance in semi-major axis\nbetween the planet and boundary depends on the planet mass to the 2/7 power and\nis independent of the planet eccentricity, at least for planet eccentricities\nbelow 0.3. Our integrations reveal a similarity between the dynamics of\nparticles at zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit and with zero\nfree eccentricity particles near an eccentric planet. The 2/7 law has been\npreviously explained by estimating the semi-major at which the first order mean\nmotion resonances are large enough to overlap. Orbital dynamics near an\neccentric planet could differ due to first order corotation resonances that\nhave strength proportional to the planet's eccentricity. However, we find the\ncorotation resonance width at low free eccentricity is small. Also the first\norder resonance width at zero free eccentricity is the same as that for a zero\neccentricity particle near a planet in a circular orbit. This accounts for\ninsensitivity of the chaotic zone width to planet eccentricity. Particles at\nzero free eccentricity near an eccentric planet have similar dynamics to those\nat zero eccentricity near a planet in a circular orbit.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]
