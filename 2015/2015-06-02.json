Within quantum networks, which consist of a system of waveguides\nand nanocavities with embedded quantum dots, it has been demonstrated in theory\nthat many-qubit states stored in electron spins could be teleported from one\nquantum dot to another via a single photon using the Single Photon Faraday\nEffect. However, in addition to being able to transfer quantum information from\none location to another, quantum networks need added functionality such as (1)\ncontrolling the flow of the quantum information and (2) performing specific\noperations on qubits that can be easily integrated. In this paper, we show how\nin principle a single photon Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which uses the\nconcept of the single photon Faraday Effect to manipulate the geometrical phase\nof a single photon, can be operated both as a switch to control the flow of\nquantum information inside the quantum network and as various single qubit\nquantum gates to perform operations on a single photon. Our proposed\nMach-Zehnder interferometer can be fully integrated as part of a quantum\nnetwork on a chip. Given that the X gate, the Z gate, and the XZ gate are\nessential for the implementation of quantum teleportation, we show explicitly\ntheir implementation by means of our proposed single photon Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer.

Geometrically the\neffect of brane displacement is manifested in terms of a coordinate translation\nalong the extra dimension, thereby producing a change in the geodesic motion\nalong the extra dimension in the region close to the brane.

Two general strategies for RLE have been proposed: One\nstrategy is to manually construct an asymmetric similarity measure for context\nvectors (directional similarity) and another is to treat RLE as a problem of\nlearning to recognize semantic relations using supervised machine learning\ntechniques (relation classification). In this paper, we experiment with two\nrecent state-of-the-art representatives of the two general strategies.

The\nthird approach represents a word pair, a:b, with a feature vector in which the\nfeatures are the differences in the similarities of a and b to a set of\nreference words.

However, since over a decade now,\nvariations of it are also routinely being implemented with ultracold atoms in\noptical lattices. We review some of the rich literature on this subject, with a\nfocus on more recent non-standard forms of the Hubbard model. After an\nintroduction to standard (fermionic and bosonic) Hubbard models, we discuss\nbriefly common models for mixtures, as well as the so called extended\nBose-Hubbard models, that include interactions between neighboring sites,\nnext-neighboring sites, and so on. The main part of the review discusses the\nimportance of additional terms appearing when refining the tight-binding\napproximation on the original physical Hamiltonian. Even when restricting the\nmodels to the lowest Bloch band is justified, the standard approach neglects\nthe density-induced tunneling (which has the same origin as the usual on-site\ninteraction). The importance of these contributions is discussed for both\ncontact and dipolar interactions. For sufficiently strong interactions, also\nthe effects related to higher Bloch bands become important even for deep\noptical lattices.

In spite of this progress, attempts to relate information obtained from\nelastic and DIS experiments have been sparse. To ameliorate this situation, we\ndevelop an interpolating model using light-front wave functions capable of\ncomputing both DIS and elastic observables. This framework is used to show that\nexisting knowledge of DIS places significant restrictions on our wave\nfunctions. The result is that the predicted effects of nucleon strangeness on\nelastic observables are much smaller than those tolerated by direct fits to PV\nelastic scattering data alone. Using our model, we find $-0.024 \\le \\mu_s \\le\n0.035$, and $-0.137 \\le \\rho^D_s \\le 0.081$ for the strange contributions to\nthe nucleon magnetic moment and charge radius.

One of the main\nchallenges in such recognition is the ability to distinguish between image\nfeatures resulting from the vessels surface and image features resulting from\nthe material inside the vessel. Reflections and the functional parts of a\nvessels surface can create strong edges that can be mistakenly identified as\ncorresponding to the vessel contents, and cause recognition errors. The ability\nto evaluate whether a specific edge in an image stems from the vessels surface\nor from its contents can considerably improve the ability to identify materials\ninside transparent vessels. This work will suggest a method for such\nevaluation, based on the following two assumptions: 1) Areas of high curvature\non the vessel surface are likely to cause strong edges due to changes in\nreflectivity, as is the appearance of functional parts (e.g. corks or valves).\n2) Most transparent vessels (bottles, glasses) have high symmetry\n(cylindrical). As a result the curvature angle of the vessels surface at each\npoint of the image is similar to the curvature angle of the contour line of the\nvessel in the same row in the image. These assumptions, allow the\nidentification of image regions with strong edges corresponding to the vessel\nsurface reflections.

To discover underlying local\nstructures in the gradient domain, we compute image gradients from multiple\ndirections and simplify them into a set of binary strings. The SBGP is derived\nfrom certain types of these binary strings that have meaningful local\nstructures and are capable of resembling fundamental textural information. They\ndetect micro orientational edges and possess strong orientation and locality\ncapabilities, thus enabling great discrimination. The SBGP also benefits from\nthe advantages of the gradient domain and exhibits profound robustness against\nillumination variations. The binary strategy realized by pixel correlations in\na small neighborhood substantially simplifies the computational complexity and\nachieves extremely efficient processing with only 0.0032s in Matlab for a\ntypical face image. Furthermore, the discrimination power of the SBGP can be\nenhanced on a set of defined orientational image gradient magnitudes, further\nenforcing locality and orientation.

We find a fundamental correlation between the source\nbolometric luminosity and the wind velocity, with v_out \\propto L_bol^{\\alpha}\nand \\alpha=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ (90% confidence), which indicates that more\nluminous AGN tend to harbour faster Fe K winds. The mass outflow rate M_out,\nkinetic power L_k and momentum flux P_out of the winds are also consequently\ncorrelated with L_bol, such that more massive and more energetic winds are\npresent in more luminous AGN. We investigate these properties in the framework\nof a continuum-driven wind, showing that the observed relationships are broadly\nconsistent with a wind being accelerated by continuum-scattering.

Consider also a quantum algorithm $\\mathcal A$ such that $A\n|0\\rangle= \\sum_{x\\in X} \\alpha_x |x\\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the\nelements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is\nproduced if $A |0\\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$,\nmeasuring the output, and using $\\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we\nshall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found.\n*Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an\nexpected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to\n$1/\\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a\ngeneralization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to\nproducing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise\nthat a single $x$ existed such that $\\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or\nnot the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known,\nwe can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse\nwhich is proportional to $1/\\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this\nquadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems\nfor which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we\ncombine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude\nestimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply\namplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish\nto estimate the number of $x\\in X$ such that $\\chi(x)=1$.
