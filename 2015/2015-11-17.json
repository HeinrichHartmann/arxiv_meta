In\nthis paper, for the direct adaptation of the method to minimize the sum of a\nproper closed function $g$ and a smooth function $f$ with a Lipschitz\ncontinuous gradient, we show that if the step-size parameter is smaller than a\ncomputable threshold and the sequence generated has a cluster point, then it\ngives a stationary point of the optimization problem.

A scientist\ndeveloping a model for spatial data has a number of options regarding the\nnature of the dependence between observations. One of these options is deciding\nwhether or not the dependence between observations depends on direction, or, in\nother words, whether or not the spatial covariance function is isotropic.\nIsotropy implies that spatial dependence is a function of only the distance and\nnot the direction of the spatial separation between sampling locations. A\nresearcher may use graphical techniques, such as directional sample\nsemivariograms, to determine whether an assumption of isotropy holds. These\ngraphical diagnostics can be difficult to assess, subject to personal\ninterpretation, and potentially misleading as they typically do not include a\nmeasure of uncertainty. In order to escape these issues, a hypothesis test of\nthe assumption of isotropy may be more desirable.

Because real ground states should have all\nsymmetries of the nuclear Hamiltonian, these methods require subsequent\nsymmetry restoration.\n  Purpose: We implement and study Lipkin method of approximate variation after\nprojection applied to the restoration of the translational or rotational\nsymmetries.\n  Methods: We use Lipkin operators up to quadratic terms in momenta or angular\nmomenta with self-consistently determined values of the Peierls-Yoccoz\ntranslational masses or moments of inertia, respectively. Calculations based on\nSkyrme energy-density functional are performed for heavy, deformed, and paired\nnuclei.\n  Results: In deformed nuclei, the Peierls-Yoccoz translational masses along\nthree different principal-axes directions of the intrinsic system can be\ndifferent, which illustrates different widths of the total-momentum\ndistributions. Numerically, the differences are only of the order of a few per\ncent. For the rotational-symmetry restoration, the Lipkin method compares\nfavorably with the exact angular-momentum projection, which requires much\nlarger computational effort.\n  Conclusions: The Lipkin method of translational and rotational symmetry\nrestoration is a practical low-cost method of determining the corresponding\ncorrelation energies. It allows for a simultaneous restoration of several\nsymmetries and can be relatively easily implemented in the standard\nself-consistent mean-field calculations, including those required for the\nparameter adjustments.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 10 figures, version submitted to Physical Review C"]}]

The algorithm is optimal for\nboth integer and floating-point data, working in O(n) and O(n lg n) time,\nrespectively.

In the proposed resonant free\nvibration non-destructive method, each rod-shaped test specimen was hit by a\nhammer at one end of specimen and immediately the acoustic response of the\nspecimen was recorded by a microphone at the other end of the sample.\nSubsequently, the recorded sounds were analysed using fast Fourier transform\ntechnique. Then, frequency of the first mode of vibration for each composite\nspecimen was utilised to calculate modulus of elasticity. Further, decrement in\nvibration energy as a function of time was examined to obtain loss parameter\n(tan {\\delta}) of the provided composites. Moreover, parameters (i.e., elastic\nmodulus and tan {\\delta}) were also compared with those determined by dynamic\nmechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). It is found that the results obtained from\nthe examined non-destructive test method are in consistent with those measured\nby DMTA approach, providing reliable, accurate and quick responses.\n","Comment: Iranian Polymer Journal, Volume 21, Issue 9, September 2012"]}]

When the \\Ovi components are characterized by small\nDoppler parameters, the ionizing mechanism is most likely photoionization;\notherwise, collisional ionization is the dominant mechanism.\n  2) The baryon- and metal-content of the \\Ovi absorbers at $z\\approx2$ is less\nthan one per cent of the total mass-density of baryons and metals at that\nredshift. Therefore, \\Ovi absorbers do not trace the bulk of baryons and metals\nat that epoch.\n  3) The \\Ovi gas density, metallicity and non-thermal broadening mechanisms\nare significantly different at high redshift with respect to low redshift. In\nparticular, non-thermal broadening mechanisms appear less important at high\nredshift as compared to low redshift, where the turbulence in the absorption\ngas might be significant. This, together with the result that \\Ovi arises in\ndifferent environments, embedded in small- and large-scale structures,\nindicates that \\Ovi does not trace characteristic regions in the circumgalactic\nand intergalactic medium, but rather traces a gas phase with a characteristic\ntransition temperature ($T\\sim10^{5}$K).\n  4) The \\Ovi absorbers at high redshift arise in gas with metallicities\nsignificantly higher than the surrounding environment, which suggests an\ninhomogeneous metal enrichment of the IGM.\n","Comment: 173 pages, 48 main body figures +14 appendix figures"]}]

This algorithm breaks each\nvehicle trajectory into a few sections and each is analytically solvable.

Dengue is a mosquito-borne\nvirus that annually infects over 400 million people worldwide. We developed a\nreal-time forecasting model for dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 77 provinces of\nThailand. We created an operational and computational infrastructure that\ngenerated multi-step predictions of dengue incidence in Thai provinces every\ntwo weeks throughout 2014. These predictions show mixed performance across\nprovinces, out-performing na\\\"ive seasonal models in over half of provinces at\na 1.5 month horizon. Additionally, to assess the degree to which delays in case\nreporting make long-range prediction a challenging task, we compared the\nperformance of our real-time predictions with predictions made with fully\nreported data.

A surprising finding of the\nstudy is that cessations/reversals of the LSC in FC77 of the two-layer system\noccur much more frequently than they do in single-layer turbulent RBC, and that\na cessation is most likely to result in a flow reversal of the LSC, which is in\nsharp contrast with the uniform distribution of the orientational angular\nchange of the LSC before and after cessations in single-layer turbulent RBC.\nThis implies that the dynamics governing cessations and reversals in the two\nsystems are very different. Two coupling modes, thermal coupling (flow\ndirections of the two LSCs are opposite to each other at the fluid-fluid\ninterface) and viscous coupling (flow directions of the two LSCs are the same\nat the fluid-fluid interface), are identified with the former one as the\npredominant mode.

Many of the algebraic results are proved by topological methods,\nvia consideration of the space of orderings. After a discussion H\\\"older's\ntheorem and some dynamical aspects of orderable groups, we provide explicit\norderings of important groups in topology: free groups and most surface groups.\n  Next we consider orderability of the fundamental groups of three-dimensional\nmanifolds.

We present a generalized CE framework, in which\nproperties such as energy can be unambiguously expanded in the amino-acid\nsequence space. The CE coarse grains over nonsequence degrees of freedom (e.g.,\nside-chain conformations) and thereby simplifies the problem of designing\nproteins, or predicting the compatibility of a sequence with a given structure,\nby many orders of magnitude. The CE is physically transparent, and can be\nevaluated through linear regression on the energies of training sequences. We\nshow, as example, that good prediction accuracy is obtained with up to pairwise\ninteractions for a coiled-coil backbone, and that triplet interactions are\nimportant in the energetics of a more globular zinc-finger backbone.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures"]}]

It\nis well known that quantum dynamical semigroups that preserve the identity\noperator (which we refer to as unital) are strictly purity-decreasing\ntransformations. Here we provide an almost complete characterization of the\nclass of strictly purity-decreasing quantum dynamical semigroups.
