One of\nthe main themes in this work is that, after a careful study of the mathematics\nof the symmetry algebras one finds that in an integrable model, one can\ndirectly reconstruct S-matrices just from the algebra. It has been known for a\nlong time that S-matrices in integrable models are fixed by symmetry. However,\nLie algebra symmetry, the Yang-Baxter equation, crossing and unitarity, which\nare what constrains the S-matrix in integrable models, are often taken to be\nseparate, independent properties of the S-matrix. Here, we construct scattering\nmatrices purely from the Yangian, showing that the Yangian is the right\nalgebraic object to unify all required symmetries of many integrable models. In\nparticular, we reconstruct the S-matrix of the principal chiral field, and, up\nto a CDD factor, of other integrable field theories with su(n) symmetry.\nFurthermore, we study the AdS/CFT correspondence, which is also believed to be\nintegrable in the planar limit. We reconstruct the S-matrices at weak and at\nstrong coupling from the Yangian or its classical limit. We give a pedagogical\nintroduction into the subject, presenting a unified perspective of Yangians and\ntheir applications in physics.

For l>100 we develop a method\nbased on tiling the cut-sky with local 10x10 degrees overlapping tangent planes\n(referred to in the following as \"patches\"). It requires to solve various\nissues concerning their size/position, non-periodic boundaries and irregularly\nsampled data after the sphere-to-plane projection. We show how the leading\nnoise term of the quadratic lensing estimator applied onto an apodized patch\ncan still be taken directly from the data. To not loose spatial accuracy, we\ndeveloped a tool that allows the fast determination of the complex Fourier\nseries coefficients from a bi-dimensional irregularly sampled dataset, without\nperforming an interpolation. We show that the multi-patch approach allows the\nlensing power spectrum reconstruction with a very small bias, thanks to\navoiding the galactic mask and lowering the noise inhomogeneities, while still\nhaving almost a minimal variance.

Modeling endogenous entry in crowdsourcing is important\nbecause there is a nonzero cost to making a contribution of any quality which\ncan be avoided by not participating, and indeed many sites based on\ncrowdsourced content do not have adequate participation. We use a mechanism\nwith monotone, rank-based, rewards in a model where agents strategically make\nparticipation and quality choices to capture a wide variety of crowdsourcing\nenvironments, ranging from conventional crowdsourcing contests to crowdsourced\ncontent as in online Q&A forums.\n  We first explicitly construct the unique mixed-strategy equilibrium for such\nmonotone rank-order mechanisms, and use these participation probabilities and\nquality distribution to address the design of incentives for two kinds of\nrewards that arise in crowdsourcing. We first show that for attention rewards\nas in crowdsourced content, the entire equilibrium distribution improves when\nthe rewards for every rank but the last are as high as possible. In particular,\nwhen producing the lowest quality content has low cost, the optimal mechanism\ndisplays all but the worst contribution. We next investigate settings where\nthere is a total reward that can be arbitrarily distributed amongst all\nparticipants, as in crowdsourcing contests.

However, the embedding\napproach, which advantageously converts the hybrid optimal control problem to a\nclassical nonlinear optimization, has not been extensively compared to\nalternative solution approaches. The goal of this paper is thus to compare the\nembedding approach to multi-parametric programming, mixed-integer programming\n(e.g., CPLEX), and gradient-descent based methods in the context of five\nrecently published examples: a spring-mass system, moving-target tracking for a\nmobile robot, two-tank filling, DC-DC boost converter, and skid-steered\nvehicle.

It is shown that there are numerical advantages of the\nembedding approach: lower performance index cost (except in some instances when\nautonomous switches are present), generally faster solution time, and\nconvergence to a solution when other methods may fail. In addition, the\nembedding method requires no ad hoc assumptions (e.g., predetermined mode\nsequences) or specialized control models.

These predictions are used to\nanalyze recent measurements, or to plan future experiments. Increasingly more\nexperimental scientists in these fields therefore face the natural question:\nwhat is the expected error for such an ab initio prediction? Information and\nexperience about this question is scattered over two decades of literature. The\npresent review aims to summarize and quantify this implicit knowledge. This\nleads to a practical protocol that allows any scientist - experimental or\ntheoretical - to determine justifiable error estimates for many basic property\npredictions, without having to perform additional DFT calculations. A central\nrole is played by a large and diverse test set of crystalline solids,\ncontaining all ground-state elemental crystals (except most lanthanides). For\nseveral properties of each crystal, the difference between DFT results and\nexperimental values is assessed. We discuss trends in these deviations and\nreview explanations suggested in the literature. A prerequisite for such an\nerror analysis is that different implementations of the same first-principles\nformalism provide the same predictions. Therefore, the reproducibility of\npredictions across several mainstream methods and codes is discussed too. A\nquality factor Delta expresses the spread in predictions from two distinct DFT\nimplementations by a single number. To compare the PAW method to the highly\naccurate APW+lo approach, a code assessment of VASP and GPAW with respect to\nWIEN2k yields Delta values of 1.9 and 3.3 meV/atom, respectively.

In such networks, a transmitter\nsends one or more signalling molecules, which are diffused over the medium, to\nthe receiver to realise the communication. In order to be able to engineer\nsynthetic molecular communication networks, mathematical models for these\nnetworks are required. This paper proposes a new stochastic model for molecular\ncommunication networks called reaction-diffusion master equation with exogenous\ninput (RDMEX). The key idea behind RDMEX is to model the transmitters as time\nseries of signalling molecule counts, while diffusion in the medium and\nchemical reactions at the receivers are modelled as Markov processes using\nmaster equation. An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model\nmolecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers. For\nthe case where the reaction kinetics at the receivers is linear, we show how\nRDMEX can be used to determine the mean and covariance of the receiver output\nsignals, and derive closed-form expressions for the mean receiver output signal\nof the RDMEX model. These closed-form expressions reveal that the output signal\nof a receiver can be affected by the presence of other receivers.

While R-DMFT describes the Kondo effect of a single\nadatom exactly, indirect magnetic (RKKY) exchange is taken into account on an\napproximate level only. Here, we consider a simplified model system consisting\nof two magnetic Hubbard sites (\"adatoms\") hybridizing with a non-interacting\ntight-binding chain (\"substrate surface\"). This two-impurity Anderson model\nincorporates the competition between the Kondo effect and indirect exchange but\nis amenable to an exact numerical solution via the density-matrix\nrenormalization group (DMRG). The particle-hole symmetric model at half-filling\nand zero temperature is used to benchmark R-DMFT results for the magnetic\ncoupling between the two adatoms and for the magnetic properties induced in the\nsubstrate. In particular, the dependence of the local adatom and the nonlocal\nadatom-adatom static susceptibilities as well as the magnetic response of the\nsubstrate on the distance between the adatoms and on the strength of their\ncoupling with the substrate is studied. We find both, excellent agreement with\nthe DMRG data even on subtle details of the competition between RKKY exchange\nand the Kondo effect but also complete failure of the R-DMFT, depending on the\nparameter regime considered. R-DMFT calculations are performed using the\nLanczos method as impurity solver. With the real-space extension of the\ntwo-site DMFT, we also benchmark a simplified R-DMFT variant.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Both are decoded by iterative algorithms, which require a\ndisproportional computational effort for low channel noise. They are also\nunable to correct higher noise levels, still below the Shannon theoretical\nlimit. In this paper, we discuss an enhanced version of a convolutional-like\ndecoding paradigm which adopts very large spaces of possible system states, of\nthe order of $2^{64}$. Under such conditions, the traditional convolution\noperation is rendered useless and needs to be replaced by a carefully designed\nstate transition procedure. The size of the system state space completely\nchanges the correction philosophy, as state collisions are virtually impossible\nand the decoding procedure becomes a correction tree. The proposed decoding\nalgorithm is practically cost-free for low channel noise. As the channel noise\napproaches the Shannon limit, it is still possible to perform correction,\nalthough its cost increases to infinity. In many applications, the implemented\ndecoder can essentially outperform both LDPC and TC. This paper describes the\nproposed correction paradigm and theoretically analyzes the asymptotic\ncorrection performance. The considered encoder and decoder were verified\nexperimentally for the binary symmetric channel. The correction process remains\npractically cost-free for channel error rates below 0.05 and 0.13 for the 1/2\nand 1/4 rate codes, respectively. For the considered resource limit, the output\nbit error rates reach the order of $10^{-3}$ for channel error rates 0.08 and\n0.18. The proposed correction paradigm can be easily extended to other\ncommunication channels; the appropriate generalizations are also discussed in\nthis study.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory"]}]

We circumvent the exponential catastrophe by marginalising\nnumerically instead of analytically over the possible supernova types: we\naugment the cosmological parameters with nuisance parameters describing the\ncovariance matrix and the types of all the supernovae, \\tau_i, that we include\nin our MCMC analysis. We show that this method deals well even with large,\nunknown systematic uncertainties without a major increase in computational\ntime, whereas ignoring the correlations can lead to significant biases and\nincorrect credible contours. We then compare the numerical marginalisation\ntechnique with a perturbative expansion of the posterior based on the insight\nthat future surveys will have exquisite light curves and hence the probability\nthat a given candidate is a Type Ia will be close to unity or zero, for most\nobjects. Although this perturbative approach changes computation of the\nposterior from a 2^N problem into an N^2 or N^3 one, we show that it leads to\nbiases in general through a small number of misclassifications, implying that\nnumerical marginalisation is superior.\n","Comment: Resubmitted under married name Lochner (formally Knights).

Based on the well-defined TOUGH sample of 69\nX-ray selected Swift GRBs, we have targeted the hosts of a subsample of 20 GRBs\nknown from afterglow spectroscopy to be in the redshift range 1.8-4.5. We\ndetect Lya emission from 7 out of the 20 hosts, with the typical limiting\n3sigma line flux being 8E-18 erg/cm2/s, corresponding to a Lya luminosity of\n6E41 erg/s at z=3. The Lya luminosities for the 7 hosts in which we detect Lya\nemission are in the range (0.6-2.3)E42 erg/s corresponding to star-formation\nrates of 0.6-2.1 Msun/yr (not corrected for extinction). The rest-frame Lya\nequivalent widths (EWs) for the 7 hosts are in the range 9-40A. For 6 of the 13\nhosts for which Lya is not detected we place fairly strong 3sigma upper limits\non the EW (<20A), while for others the EW is either unconstrained or has a less\nconstraining upper limit. We find that the distribution of Lya EWs is\ninconsistent with being drawn from the Lya EW distribution of bright Lyman\nbreak galaxies at the 98.3% level, in the sense that the TOUGH hosts on average\nhave larger EWs than bright LBGs. We can exclude an early indication, based on\na smaller, heterogeneous sample of pre-Swift GRB hosts, that all GRB hosts are\nLya emitters. We find that the TOUGH hosts on average have lower EWs than the\npre-Swift GRB hosts, but the two samples are only inconsistent at the 92%\nlevel. The velocity centroid of the Lya line is redshifted by 200-700 km/s with\nrespect to the systemic velocity, similar to what is seen for LBGs, possibly\nindicating star-formation driven outflows from the host galaxies. There seems\nto be a trend between the Lya EW and the optical to X-ray spectral index of the\nafterglow (beta_OX), hinting that dust plays a role in the observed strength\nand even presence of Lya emission.

The prominence of EB is primarily attributed to its asymptotic\nthroughput stability, which ensures a non-zero throughput even when the number\nof users in the network goes to infinity. Recent studies, however, show that EB\nis fundamentally unsuitable for applications that are sensitive to large delay\nand delay jitters, as it induces divergent second- and higher-order moments of\nmedium access delay. Essentially, the medium access delay follows a power law\ndistribution, a subclass of heavy-tailed distribution. To understand and\nalleviate the issue, this paper systematically analyzes the tail delay\ndistribution of general backoff functions, with EB being a special case. In\nparticular, we establish a tradeoff between the tail decaying rate of medium\naccess delay distribution and the stability of throughput. To be more specific,\nconvergent delay moments are attainable only when the backoff functions $g(k)$\ngrows slower than exponential functions, i.e., when $g(k)\\in o(r^k)$ for all\n$r>1$. On the other hand, non-zero asymptotic throughput is attainable only\nwhen backoff functions grow at least as fast as an exponential function, i.e.,\n$g(k)\\in\\Omega(r^k)$ for some $r>1$. This implies that bounded delay moments\nand stable throughput cannot be achieved at the same time. For practical\nimplementation, we show that polynomial backoff (PB), where $g(k)$ is a\npolynomial that grows slower than exponential functions, obtains finite delay\nmoments and good throughput performance at the same time within a practical\nrange of user population. This makes PB a better alternative than EB for\nmultimedia applications with stringent delay requirements.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures"]}]

The geometric model of\nconcurrency is interesting from two main reasons: its generality and\nexpressiveness, and the natural way in which autoconcurrency and action\nrefinement are captured. Logics for this model, though, are not well\ninvestigated, where a simple, yet adequate, modal logic over HDAs was only\nrecently introduced. As this modal logic, with two existential modalities,\nduring and after, captures only split bisimulation, which is rather low in the\nspectrum of van Glabbeek and Vaandrager, the immediate question was what small\nextension of this logic could capture the more fine-grained hereditary history\npreserving bisimulation (hh)? In response, the work in this paper provides\nseveral insights. One is the fact that the geometrical aspect of HDAs makes it\npossible to use for capturing the hh-bisimulation, a standard modal logic that\ndoes not employ event variables, opposed to the two logics (over less\nexpressive models) that we compare with. The logic that we investigate here\nuses standard past modalities and extends the previously introduced logic\n(called HDML) that had only forward, action-labelled, modalities. Besides, we\ntry to understand better the above issues by introducing a related model that\nwe call ST-configuration structures, which extend the configuration structures\nof van Glabbeek and Plotkin. We relate this model to HDAs, and redefine and\nprove the earlier results in the light of this new model. These offer a\ndifferent view on why the past modalities and geometrical concurrency capture\nthe hereditary history preserving bisimulation. Additional correlating insights\nare also gained.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures"]}]

We find that the correlation time of the bath is\ninfinite, which implies that the bath has a perfect memory, and that the\ndynamical evolution of the central spin must be non- Markovian. A direct\nconsequence is that the final state of the central spin is not the thermal\nstate equilibrium with the bath, but a steady state which depends on its\ninitial state.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

That is, each peer\nworks towards a network structure that allows himself to communicate\nefficiently with all other peers. However, participants of large networks are\nseldom interested in all peers. Rather, they want to communicate efficiently\nonly with a small subset of peers. Our model incorporates these (communication)\ninterests explicitly. In the MAX-version, each node tries to minimize its\nmaximum distance to nodes it is interested in.\n  Given peers with interests and a communication network forming a tree, we\nprove several results on the structure and quality of equilibria in our model.\nFor the MAX-version, we give an upper worst case bound of O(\\sqrt{n}) for the\nprivate costs in an equilibrium of n peers. Moreover, we give an equilibrium\nfor a circular interest graph where a node has private cost \\Omega(\\sqrt{n}),\nshowing that our bound is tight. This example can be extended such that we get\na tight bound of \\Theta(\\sqrt{n}) for the price of anarchy. For the case of\ngeneral communication networks we show the price of anarchy to be \\Theta(n).\nAdditionally, we prove an interesting connection between a maximum independent\nset in the interest graph and the private costs of the peers.\n","Comment: An extended abstract of this paper has been accepted for publication\n  in the proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Algorithmic Game\n  Theory (SAGT)"]}]

For stochastic differential equations\n(SDE's) time discretization numerical schemes usually destroy the property of\ntime-reversibility. Despite an extensive literature on the numerical analysis\nfor SDE's, their stability properties, strong and/or weak error estimates,\nlarge deviations and infinite-time estimates, no quantitative results are known\non the lack of reversibility of the discrete-time approximation process. In\nthis paper we provide such quantitative estimates by using the concept of\nentropy production rate, inspired by ideas from non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics. The entropy production rate for a stochastic process is defined as\nthe relative entropy (per unit time) of the path measure of the process with\nrespect to the path measure of the time-reversed process. By construction the\nentropy production rate is nonnegative and it vanishes if and only if the\nprocess is reversible. Crucially, from a numerical point of view, the entropy\nproduction rate is an {\\em a posteriori} quantity, hence it can be computed in\nthe course of a simulation as the ergodic average of a certain functional of\nthe process (the so-called Gallavotti-Cohen (GC) action functional). We compute\nthe entropy production for various numerical schemes such as explicit\nEuler-Maruyama and explicit Milstein's for reversible SDEs with additive or\nmultiplicative noise.

We introduce Biff codes, which are based on Bloom filters\nand are designed for large data. For Biff codes with a message of length $L$\nand $E$ errors, the encoding time is $O(L)$, decoding time is $O(L + E)$ and\nthe space overhead is $O(E)$.

We derive Biff\ncodes by a simple reduction from a set reconciliation algorithm for a recently\ndeveloped data structure, invertible Bloom lookup tables. While the underlying\ntheory is extremely simple, what makes this code especially attractive is the\nease with which it can be implemented and the speed of decoding.

It will be showed and motivated that\nsocial systems are typically chaotic, non-linear and/or non-equilibrium and\ntherefore complex systems. It is discussed that the rapid change in global\nconsumer behaviour is underway, that further increases the complexity in\nbusiness and management. For policy making under complexity, following\nprinciples are offered: openness and international competition, tolerance and\nvariety of ideas, self-reliability and low dependence on external help. The\nchapter contains four applications that build on the theoretical motivation of\ncomplexity in social systems. The first application demonstrates that small\neconomies have good prospects to gain from the global processes underway, if\nthey can demonstrate production flexibility, reliable business ethics and good\nrisk management. The second application elaborates on and discusses the\nopportunities and challenges in decision making under complexity from macro and\nmicro economic perspective. In this environment, the challenges for corporate\nmanagement are being also permanently changed: the balance between short term\nnoise and long term chaos whose attractor includes customers, shareholders and\nemployees must be found. The emergence of chaos in economic relationships is\ndemonstrated by a simple system of differential equations that relate the\nstakeholders described above. The chapter concludes with two financial\napplications: about debt and risk management. The non-equilibrium economic\nestablishment leads to additional problems by using excessive borrowing;\nunexpected downturns in economy can more easily kill companies. Finally, the\ndemand for quantitative improvements in risk management is postulated.\n","Comment: Will appear as a chapter in \"Chaos Theory in Politics\", eds Santo\n  Banerjee, S.Sule Ercetin, A.Tekin by Spinger"]}]

The players push a token along\nthe edges of the digraph. The winner is determined by the parity of the\ngreatest priority occurring infinitely often in this infinite play.\n  A motivation for studying parity games comes from the area of formal\nverification of systems by model checking. Deciding the winner in a parity game\nis polynomial time equivalent to the model checking problem of the modal\nmu-calculus. Another strong motivation lies in the fact that the exact\ncomplexity of solving parity games is a long-standing open problem, the\ncurrently best known algorithm being subexponential. It is known that the\nproblem is in the complexity classes UP and coUP.\n  In this paper we identify restricted classes of digraphs where the problem is\nsolvable in polynomial time, following an approach from structural graph\ntheory. We consider three standard graph operations: the join of two graphs,\nrepeated pasting along vertices, and the addition of a vertex. Given a class C\nof digraphs on which we can solve parity games in polynomial time, we show that\nthe same holds for the class obtained from C by applying once any of these\nthree operations to its elements.\n  These results provide, in particular, polynomial time algorithms for parity\ngames whose underlying graph is an orientation of a complete graph, a complete\nbipartite graph, a block graph, or a block-cactus graph. These are classes\nwhere the problem was not known to be efficiently solvable.\n  Previous results concerning restricted classes of parity games which are\nsolvable in polynomial time include classes of bounded tree-width, bounded\nDAG-width, and bounded clique-width.\n  We also prove that recognising the winning regions of a parity game is not\neasier than computing them from scratch.\n"]}]

Quasinormal Pulsations of Schwarzschild and Kerr Black Holes"],"description":["  In recent papers, we and colleagues have introduced a way to visualize the\nfull vacuum Riemann curvature tensor using frame-drag vortex lines and their\nvorticities, and tidal tendex lines and their tendicities. We have also\nintroduced the concepts of horizon vortexes and tendexes and 3-D vortexes and\ntendexes (regions where vorticities or tendicities are large). Using these\nconcepts, we discover a number of previously unknown features of quasinormal\nmodes of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. These modes can be classified by\nmode indexes (n,l,m), and parity, which can be electric [(-1)^l] or magnetic\n[(-1)^(l+1)]. Among our discoveries are these: (i) There is a near duality\nbetween modes of the same (n,l,m): a duality in which the tendex and vortex\nstructures of electric-parity modes are interchanged with the vortex and tendex\nstructures (respectively) of magnetic-parity modes. (ii) This near duality is\nperfect for the modes' complex eigenfrequencies (which are well known to be\nidentical) and perfect on the horizon; it is slightly broken in the equatorial\nplane of a non-spinning hole, and the breaking becomes greater out of the\nequatorial plane, and greater as the hole is spun up; but even out of the plane\nfor fast-spinning holes, the duality is surprisingly good. (iii)\nElectric-parity modes can be regarded as generated by 3-D tendexes that stick\nradially out of the horizon. As these \"longitudinal,\" near-zone tendexes rotate\nor oscillate, they generate longitudinal-transverse near-zone vortexes and\ntendexes, and outgoing and ingoing gravitational waves. The ingoing waves act\nback on the longitudinal tendexes, driving them to slide off the horizon, which\nresults in decay of the mode's strength. (iv) By duality, magnetic-parity modes\nare driven in this same manner by longitudinal, near-zone vortexes that stick\nout of the horizon.

Recently, a strong\ncorrelation was found between the strength of the bar and the presence of\nchaotic motion in this system, as models with relatively strong bars were shown\nto exhibit stronger chaotic behavior compared to those having a weaker bar\ncomponent. Here, we attempt to further explore this connection by studying the\ninterplay between chaotic and regular behavior of star orbits when the\nparameters of the model evolve in time. This happens for example when one\nintroduces linear time dependence in the mass parameters of the model to mimic,\nin some general sense, the effect of self-consistent interactions of the actual\nN-body problem. We thus observe, in this simple time-dependent model also, that\nthe increase of the bar's mass leads to an increase of the system's chaoticity.\nWe propose a new way of using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method as\na reliable criterion to estimate the relative fraction of chaotic vs. regular\norbits in such time-dependent potentials, which proves to be much more\nefficient than the computation of Lyapunov exponents. In particular, GALI is\nable to capture subtle changes in the nature of an orbit (or ensemble of\norbits) even for relatively small time intervals, which makes it ideal for\ndetecting dynamical transitions in time-dependent systems.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 9 figures (minor typos fixed) to appear in J.

Physics of the hot gas in the Coma\n  cluster"],"description":["  We present an analysis of Planck satellite data on the Coma Cluster observed\nvia the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Planck is able, for the first time, to detect\nSZ emission up to r ~ 3 X R_500. We test previously proposed models for the\npressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. We\nfind that the Arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit Coma, and\nthat their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the data\nonly at r<R_500: by r=2XR_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by a\nfactor of ~2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either i) the\ncluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of\nsight or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at r>R_500 than the mean\npressure profile predicted by the simulations. The Planck image shows\nsignificant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half a\ndegree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features\nare consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the\nwestern feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in\nthe radio. Using Planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find\npressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,\nrespectively. Assuming Rankine-Hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deduce\nthat the shock waves should propagate with Mach number M_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 and\nM_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the West and Southeast, respectively.

The results of our\nexperiments reveal that relationship forming is the most dominant online\ngrooming stage in contrast to the sexual stage. We use a widely used\nword-counting program (LIWC) to create psycho-linguistic profiles for each of\nthe six online grooming stages to discover interesting textual patterns useful\nto improve our understanding of the online pedophile phenomenon. Furthermore,\nwe present empirical results that throw light on various aspects of a pedophile\nconversation such as probability of state transitions from one stage to\nanother, distribution of a pedophile chat conversation across various online\ngrooming stages and correlations between pre-defined word categories and online\ngrooming stages.\n"]}]

Such priors include a global spatial smoothing\nparameter, whereas real risk surfaces are likely to include areas of smooth\nevolution as well as discontinuities, the latter of which are known as risk\nboundaries. Therefore, this paper proposes an extension to the class of CAR\npriors, which can identify both areas of localised spatial smoothness and risk\nboundaries.

Measuring the strength of the flow with the root-mean-square\namplitude, an optimal velocity field is shown to exist, but without limitation\non the strain rate, optimization is prone to divergence. Measuring the flow in\nterms of its associated dissipation leads to the identification of a single\noptimal at the critical magnetic Reynolds number necessary for a dynamo. This\nmagnetic Reynolds number is found to be only 15% higher than that necessary for\ntransient growth of the magnetic field.\n","Comment: Optimal velocity field given approximate analytic form. 4 pages, 4\n  figures"]}]

It is shown that this correspondence makes it possible to perform quantum\nsimulation of the single-particle spectrum and the dipole-dipole interactions\nof magnetic dipoles in a static external magnetic field $\\bf{B}$ with symmetric\ntop molecules subject to a static external electric field\n$\\bf{E}_{\\mathrm{DC}}$. We further show that no such correspondence exists for\n$^1\\Sigma$ molecules in static fields, such as the alkali metal dimers. The\neffective spin angular momentum of the simulated magnetic dipole corresponds to\nthe rotational angular momentum of the symmetric top molecule, and so quantum\nsimulation of arbitrarily large integer spins is possible. Further, taking the\nmolecule CH$_3$F as an example, we show that the characteristic dipole-dipole\ninteraction energies of the simulated magnetic dipole are a factor of 620, 600,\nand 310 larger than for the highly magnetic atoms Chromium, Erbium, and\nDysprosium, respectively. We present several applications of our correspondence\nfor many-body physics, including long-range and anisotropic spin models with\narbitrary integer spin $S$ using symmetric top molecules in optical lattices,\nquantum simulation of molecular magnets, and spontaneous demagnetization of\nBose-Einstein condensates due to dipole-dipole interactions.

At the TeV energy scale, due to the presence of large Sudakov\nlogarithms, EW corrections reach the 20-40% level and play an important role\nfor searches of physics beyond the Standard Model. The dependence of NLO EW\neffects on the jet multiplicity is investigated in detail, and we find that\nW+multijet final states feature genuinely different EW effects as compared to\nthe case of W+1jet.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 23 Figures; V2: Original results unchanged.
