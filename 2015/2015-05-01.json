The\ncorresponding near-inertial waves (NIWs) are highly energetic and play a\nsignificant role in the slow, large-scale dynamics of the ocean. To analyse\nthis role, we develop a new model of the nondissipative interactions between\nNIWs and balanced motion. The model is derived using the\ngeneralised-Lagrangian-mean (GLM) framework (specifically, the glm variant of\nSoward & Roberts (2010)), taking advantage of the time-scale separation between\nthe two types of motion to average over the short NIW period.\n  We combine Salmon's (2013) variational formulation of GLM with Whitham\naveraging to obtain a system of equations governing the joint evolution of NIWs\nand mean flow. Assuming that the mean flow is geostrophically balanced reduces\nthis system to a simple model coupling Young & Ben Jelloul's (1997) equation\nfor NIWs with a modified quasi-geostrophic equation. In this coupled model, the\nmean flow affects the NIWs through advection and refraction; conversely, the\nNIWs affect the mean flow by modifying the potential-vorticity inversion - the\nrelation between advected potential vorticity and advecting mean velocity -\nthrough a quadratic wave term, consistent with the GLM results of Bu\u007fhler &\nMcIntyre (1998).\n  The coupled model is Hamiltonian and its conservation laws, for wave action\nand energy in particular, prove illuminating: on their basis, we identify a new\ninteraction mechanism whereby NIWs forced at large scales extract energy from\nthe balanced flow as their horizontal scale is reduced by differential\nadvection and refraction so that their potential energy increases. A rough\nestimate suggests that this mechanism could provide a significant sink of\nenergy for mesoscale motion and play a part in the global energetics of the\nocean.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 4 figures"]}]

OH231\nalso presents an exceptional molecular richness probably due to shock-induced\nchemical processes. We report the first detection in this source of HNCO, HNCS,\nHC3N and NO, with the IRAM-30m telescope in a sensitive mm-wavelength survey\ntowards this target. HNCO and HNCS are also first detections in CSEs. The\nobserved line profiles show that the emission arises in the massive central\ncomponent of the envelope and at the base of the fast lobes. The NO profiles\nare broader than those of HNCO, HNCS, and HC3N, and most importantly, broader\nthan the line profiles of 13CO. This indicates that the NO abundance is\nenhanced in the fast lobes relative to the slow, central parts. From LTE and\nnon-LTE excitation analysis, we estimate beam-average rotational temperatures\nof 15-30 K (and, maybe, up to 55 K for HC3N) and fractional abundances of\nX(HNCO)=[0.8-1]E-7, X(HNCS)=[0.9-1]E-8, X(HC3N)=[5-7]E-9 and X(NO)=[1-2]E-6.

This thesis investigates\na systematic method of creating abstract interpreters from traditional\ninterpreters, called Abstracting Abstract Machines.\n  Abstract interpreters are difficult to develop due to technical, theoretical,\nand pragmatic problems. Technical problems include engineering data structures\nand algorithms. I show that modest and simple changes to the mathematical\npresentation of abstract machines result in 1000 times better running time -\njust seconds for moderately sized programs.\n  In the theoretical realm, abstraction can make correctness difficult to\nascertain. I provide proof techniques for proving the correctness of regular,\npushdown, and stack-inspecting pushdown models of abstract computation by\nleaving computational power to an external factor: allocation. Even if we don't\ntrust the proof, we can run models concretely against test suites to better\ntrust them.\n  In the pragmatic realm, I show that the systematic process of abstracting\nabstract machines is automatable. I develop a meta-language for expressing\nabstract machines similar to other semantics engineering languages. The\nlanguage's special feature is that it provides an interface to abstract\nallocation.

In the\ncontext of option pricing, the 3/2 stochastic volatility model is reported to\nbe able to capture the volatility skew evolution better than the Heston model.\nIn this article, we make a thorough investigation on the analytic tractability\nof the 3/2 stochastic volatility model by proposing a closed-form formula for\nthe partial transform of the triple joint transition density $(X,I,V)$ which\nstand for the log asset price, the quadratic variation (continuous realized\nvariance) and the instantaneous variance, respectively. Two distinct\nformulations are provided for deriving the main result. The closed-form partial\ntransform enables us to deduce a variety of marginal partial transforms and\ncharacteristic functions and plays a crucial role in pricing discretely sampled\nvariance derivatives and exotic options that depend on both the asset price and\nquadratic variation. Various applications and numerical examples on pricing\nexotic derivatives with discrete monitoring feature are given to demonstrate\nthe versatility of the partial transform under the 3/2 model.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In the\nfermionic case the GC equations resemble the form of the classical GC\nequations. We determine the Lie symmetry algebra of the classical GC equations\nto be infinite-dimensional and perform a subalgebra classification of the\none-dimensional subalgebras of its largest finite-dimensional subalgebra. We\nthen compute superalgebras of Lie point symmetries of the bosonic and fermionic\nSUSY GC equations respectively, and classify the one-dimensional subalgebras of\neach superalgebra into conjugacy classes. We then use the symmetry reduction\nmethod to find invariants, orbits and reduced systems for two one-dimensional\nsubalgebras for the classical case, two one-dimensional subalgebras for the\nbosonic SUSY case and two one-dimensional subalgebras for the fermionic SUSY\ncase. We find explicit solutions of these reduced SUSY systems, which\ncorrespond to different surfaces immersed in a Grassmann superspace. Within\nthis framework for the SUSY versions of the GC equations, a geometrical\ninterpretation of the results is discussed.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1412.4697,\n  arXiv:1412.4774"]}]

In this process, the environment matrix serves\nas an \"order parameter\" that captures patterns of entanglement in topological\nphases. The symmetry change in the environment matrix is very much like the\nsymmetry breaking of conventional order parameters. We applied this method to\nboth the transverse Ising model (1D and 2D honeycomb), spin-1 model (1D), and\nthe Toric Code model in a magnetic field (2D honeycomb), and explored the\ncorresponding symmetry structure changes in their environment matrices in\ndetails. With just a few variational parameters and a few minutes' run time on\na laptop, we could get the corresponding phase transition points within a few\npercent error compared with the Quantum Monte Carlo results.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 29 figures"]}]

Specifically, an\nanalytical expression for the local probability of detection is derived, while\nusing the approach of ED at the individual secondary user (SU), a new fusion\nrule, based on the likelihood ratio test, is presented. The channels between\nthe primary user to SUs and SUs to fusion center are considered to be\nindependent Nakagami-$m$.

Closed-form solutions for the system-level probability\nof detection and probability of false alarm are also derived. Furthermore, a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal number of cooperative SUs, needed to\nminimize the total error rate, is presented. The usefulness of factor graph and\nsum-product-algorithm models for computing likelihoods, is also discussed to\nhighlight its advantage, in terms of computational cost.
