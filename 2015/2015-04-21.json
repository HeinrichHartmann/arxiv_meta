In our model, each link has unit\nprice and each agent tries to minimize its cost, which is either its local\ndiameter or its total distance to other players in the (undirected) underlying\ngraph of the created network. Two versions of the game are studied: in the MAX\nversion, the cost incurred to a vertex is the maximum distance between the\nvertex and other vertices, and in the SUM version, the cost incurred to a\nvertex is the sum of distances between the vertex and other vertices. We prove\nthat in both versions pure Nash equilibria exist, but the problem of finding\nthe best response of a vertex is NP-hard. We take the social cost of the\ncreated network to be its diameter, and next we study the maximum possible\ndiameter of an equilibrium graph with n vertices in various cases. When the sum\nof players' budgets is n-1, the equilibrium graphs are always trees, and we\nprove that their maximum diameter is Theta(n) and Theta(log n) in MAX and SUM\nversions, respectively. When each vertex has unit budget (i.e. can establish\nlink to just one vertex), the diameter of any equilibrium graph in either\nversion is Theta(1). We give examples of equilibrium graphs in the MAX version,\nsuch that all vertices have positive budgets and yet the diameter is\nOmega(sqrt(log n)). This interesting (and perhaps counter-intuitive) result\nshows that increasing the budgets may increase the diameter of equilibrium\ngraphs and hence deteriorate the network structure. Then we prove that every\nequilibrium graph in the SUM version has diameter 2^O(sqrt(log n)).

Both are purely combinatorial criteria, depending\nonly on the transition graph of the Markov chain and the lumping function. A\nlumping is strongly k-lumpable, iff the lumped process is a k-th order Markov\nchain for each starting distribution of the original Markov chain. We\ncharacterise strong k-lumpability via tightness of stationary entropic bounds.\nIn the sparse setting, we give sufficient conditions on the lumping to both\npreserve the entropy rate and be strongly k-lumpable.\n"]}]

The recurrences for inverse space-filling functions are also\npresented. Both Peano and Hilbert curves and functions and their\ngeneralizations to higher dimensions are produced by these recurrences. The\ncomputations of these space-filling functions and their inverse functions are\nabsolutely convergent geometric series.\n  The space-filling functions are constructed as limits of integer recurrences\nand equivalently as non-terminating real recurrences. Scaling relations are\ngiven which enable the space-filling functions and curves and their inverses to\nextend beyond the unit area or volume and even to all of $d$-space.\n  This unification of pandimensional space-filling curves facilitates\nquantitative comparison of curves generated from different Hamiltonian paths.\nThe isotropy and performance in dimension reduction of a variety of\nspace-filling curves are analyzed.\n  For dimension reduction it is found that Hilbert curves perform somewhat\nbetter than Peano curves and their isotropic variants.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 20 figures"]}]

For a d-ary tree it is well\nknown that d/ln (d) is the reconstruction threshold.

The time variations are controlled\nby a stochastic particle dynamics described by an SDE. The particle dynamics\ncan be thought as particle deposition that often occurs in filter problems. Our\nmain results include the derivation of macroscale equations and showing that\nthe macroscale equations are deterministic. The latter is important for our\n(also many other) applications as it greatly simplifies the macroscale\nequations. We use the asymptotic properties of the SDE and the periodicity of\nthe Brinkman's coefficient in the space variable to prove the convergence\nresult. The SDE has a unique invariant measure that is ergodic and strongly\nmixing. The macro scale equations are derived through an averaging principle of\nthe slow motion (fluid velocity) with respect to the fast motion (particle\ndynamics) and also by averaging the Brinkman's coefficient with respect to the\nspace variable. Our results can be extended to more general nonlinear diffusion\nequations with heterogeneous coefficients.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 2 figures"]}]

Here, we report a hitherto unknown size dependence of\nthis metal enhanced fluorescence (MEF) effect in the nanoscale. When the\nmolecules are deposited in nanoporous anodic alumina films with exposed\naluminum at the bottom of the pores, they form organic nanowires standing on\naluminum nanoparticles whose plasmon waves have much larger amplitudes. This\nincreases the MEF strongly, resulting in several orders of magnitude increase\nin the fluorescence intensity of the organic fluorophores. The increase in\nintensity shows an inverse super-linear dependence on nanowire diameter because\nthe nanowires also act as plasmonic 'waveguides' that concentrate the plasmons\nand increase the coupling of the plasmons with the radiative modes of the\nmolecules. Furthermore, if the nanoporous template housing the nanowires has\nbuilt-in electric fields due to space charges, a strong molecule-specific red-\nor blue-shift is induced in the fluorescence peak owing to a renormalization of\nthe dipole moment of the molecule.

This\nhas been demonstrated within a wide range of systems in physical, technological\nand biological contexts.
