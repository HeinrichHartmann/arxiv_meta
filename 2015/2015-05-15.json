The calculation is carried out in the Lorenz\ngauge: For a given geodesic orbit, we decompose the Lorenz-gauge metric\nperturbation equations (sourced by the delta-function particle) into tensorial\nharmonics, and solve for each harmonic using numerical evolution in the time\ndomain (in 1+1 dimensions).

The\ndissipative component is responsible for the loss of orbital energy and angular\nmomentum through gravitational radiation; as a test of our code we demonstrate\nthat the work done by the dissipative component of the computed force is\nprecisely balanced by the asymptotic fluxes of energy and angular momentum,\nwhich we extract independently from the wave-zone numerical solutions.

The network and its\nsolvent are treated using the two-fluid model. We show that the dynamics of the\nmedium can be decomposed into two independent incompressible flows. The first,\ndominant at large distances and obeying the Stokes equation, corresponds to the\ncollective flow of the two components as a whole. The other, governing the\ndynamics over an intermediate range of distances and following the Brinkman\nequation, describes the flow of the network and solvent relative to one\nanother. The crossover between these two regions occurs at a dynamic length\nscale which is much larger than the network's mesh size. The analysis focuses\non the spatial structure of the medium's response and the role played by the\ndynamic crossover length. We examine different boundary conditions at the\nsphere surface. The large-distance collective flow is shown to be independent\nof boundary conditions and network compressibility, establishing the robustness\nof two-point microrheology at large separations. The boundary conditions that\nfit the experimental results for inert spheres in entangled F-actin networks\nare those of a free network, which does not interact directly with the sphere.\nClosed-form expressions and scaling relations are derived, allowing for the\nextraction of material parameters from a combination of one- and two-point\nmicrorheology.

In this paper, we consider regularized estimation\nmethods which force by construction the eigenvalues of the scatter estimates to\nbe greater than a positive regularization parameter rho. This makes them more\nsuitable for high dimensional problems with a limited number of secondary data\nsamples than traditional sample covariance estimates. While an increase of rho\nseems to improve the conditioning of the estimate, it might however cause it to\nsignificantly deviate from the true covariance matrix. The setting of the\noptimal regularization parameter is a difficult question for which no\nconvincing answers have thus far been provided. This constitutes the major\nmotivation behind our work.

Its location is determined by the properties of the star, the mass\naccretion rate through the disk, and the size distribution of dust suspended in\nthe disk. We calculate the snow line location from recent observations of mass\naccretion rates and as a function of stellar mass. By taking the observed\ndispersion in mass accretion rates as a measure of the dispersion in initial\ndisk mass, we find that stars of a given mass will exhibit a range of snow line\nlocations. At a given age and stellar mass, the observed dispersion in mass\naccretion rates of 0.4 dex naturally leads to a dispersion in snow line\nlocations of 0.2 dex.

It is well known that\ntechniques like independent component analysis can separate the brain activity\nat rest to provide such RSNs, but the specific pattern of interaction between\nRSNs is not yet fully understood. To this aim, we propose here a novel method\nto compute the information flow (IF) between different RSNs from resting state\nmagnetic resonance imaging. After haemodynamic response function blind\ndeconvolution of all voxel signals, and under the hypothesis that RSNs define\nregions of interest, our method first uses principal component analysis to\nreduce dimensionality in each RSN to next compute IF (estimated here in terms\nof Transfer Entropy) between the different RSNs by systematically increasing k\n(the number of principal components used in the calculation). When k = 1, this\nmethod is equivalent to computing IF using the average of all voxel activities\nin each RSN. For k greater than one our method calculates the k-multivariate IF\nbetween the different RSNs. We find that the average IF among RSNs is\ndimension-dependent, increasing from k =1 (i.e., the average voxels activity)\nup to a maximum occurring at k =5 to finally decay to zero for k greater than\n10. This suggests that a small number of components (close to 5) is sufficient\nto describe the IF pattern between RSNs. Our method - addressing differences in\nIF between RSNs for any generic data - can be used for group comparison in\nhealth or disease. To illustrate this, we have calculated the interRSNs IF in a\ndataset of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) to find that the most significant\ndifferences between AD and controls occurred for k =2, in addition to AD\nshowing increased IF w.r.t. controls.\n","Comment: 47 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, 3 supplementary figures.

In the chondritic\ncomparison we calculate a N mass in Earth's core (180\\pm110 to\n300\\pm180\\times10^18 kg) and discuss the Moon as a proxy for the early mantle.\n  Significantly, we find the majority of the planetary budget of N is in the\nsolid Earth. The N estimate herein precludes the need for a \"missing N\"\nreservoir. Nitrogen-Ar systematics in mantle rocks and basalts identify two\nmantle reservoirs: MORB-source like (MSL) and high-N. High-N mantle is composed\nof young, N-rich material subducted from the surface and is identified in OIB\nand some xenoliths. In contrast, MSL appears to be made of old material, though\na component of subducted material is evident in this reservoir as well.\n  Using our new budget, we calculate a {\\delta}15N value for BSE plus\natmosphere of \\sim2\\permil. This value should be used when discussing bulk\nEarth N isotope evolution. Additionally, our work indicates that all surface N\ncould pass through the mantle over Earth history, and the mantle may act as a\nlong-term sink for N. Since N acts as a tracer of exchange between the\natmosphere, oceans, and mantle over time, clarifying its distribution in the\nEarth is critical for evolutionary models concerned with Earth system\nevolution. We suggest that N be viewed in the same vein as carbon: it has a\nfast, biologically mediated cycle which connects it to a slow,\ntectonically-controlled geologic cycle.\n","Comment: Manuscript accepted in Earth Science Reviews"]}]
