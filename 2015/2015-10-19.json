The main objective of this paper is to\nextend the probabilistic framework to directed networks, where the sampling\nbivariate distributions could be asymmetric. Our main finding is that we can\nrelax the assumption from symmetric bivariate distributions to bivariate\ndistributions that have the same marginal distributions. By using such a weaker\nassumption, we show that various notions for structural analysis in directed\nnetworks can also be defined in the same manner as before.

Experimental results with a synthetic stream of\nallocation requests show that allocation methods minimizing the maximum disk\nbandwidth and capacity utilization or their variance across all disks yield the\nmaximum number of allocated VAs. HDA saves disk bandwidth, since a single RAID\nlevel accommodating the most stringent availability requirements for a small\nsubset of objects would incur an unnecessarily high overhead for updating check\nblocks or data replicas for all objects. The number of allocated VAs can be\nincreased by adopting the clustered RAID5 paradigm, which exploits the tradeoff\nbetween redundancy and bandwidth utilization.

To assess the quality\nof these constrained simulations, we compare them with random simulations as\nwell as with local observations. The cosmic variance, defined as the mean\none-sigma scatter of cell-to-cell comparison between two fields, is\nsignificantly smaller for the constrained simulations than for the random\nsimulations. Within the inner part of the box where most of the constraints\nare, the scatter is smaller by a factor 2 to 3 on a 5 Mpc/h scale with respect\nto that found for random simulations. This one-sigma scatter obtained when\ncomparing the simulated and the observation-reconstructed velocity fields is\nonly 104 +/- 4 km/s i.e. the linear theory threshold. These two results\ndemonstrate that these simulations are in agreement with each other and with\nthe observations of our neighborhood. For the first time, simulations\nconstrained with observational radial peculiar velocities resemble the Local\nUniverse up to a distance of 150 Mpc/h on a scale of a few tens of megaparsecs.\nWhen focusing on the inner part of the box, the resemblance with our cosmic\nneighborhood extends to a few megaparsecs (< 5 Mpc/h).

H\\\"older continuity is too\nrestrictive to fulfill this minimal requirement since in this case D^2 u\ninherits the whole regularity enjoyed by f (we say that \"full regularity\"\noccurs). This two opposite situations led us to look for significant cases in\nwhich intermediate regularity (i.e., between \"mere continuity\" and \"full\nregularity\") occurs.

Recently,\nKarimi and Banihashemi proposed a characterization of ETSs, which was based on\nviewing an ETS as a layered superset (LSS) of a short cycle in the code's\nTanner graph. A notable advantage of LSS characterization is that it\ncorresponds to a simple LSS-based search algorithm that starts from short\ncycles of the graph and finds the ETSs with LSS structure efficiently. Compared\nto the LSS-based characterization of Karimi and Banihashemi, which is based on\na single LSS expansion technique, the new characterization involves two\nadditional expansion techniques. The introduction of the new techniques\nmitigates two problems that LSS-based characterization/search suffers from: (1)\nexhaustiveness, (2) search efficiency. We prove that using the three expansion\ntechniques, any ETS structure can be obtained starting from a simple cycle, no\nmatter how large the size of the structure $a$ or the number of its unsatisfied\ncheck nodes $b$ are.

Since many stencil schemes have low\narithmetic intensity, most optimizations focus on increasing the temporal data\naccess locality, thus reducing the data traffic through the main memory\ninterface with the ultimate goal of decoupling from this bottleneck. There are,\nhowever, only few approaches that explicitly leverage the shared cache feature\nof modern multicore chips. If every thread works on its private, separate cache\nblock, the available cache space can become too small, and sufficient temporal\nlocality may not be achieved.\n  We propose a flexible multi-dimensional intra-tile parallelization method for\nstencil algorithms on multicore CPUs with a shared outer-level cache. This\nmethod leads to a significant reduction in the required cache space without\nadverse effects from hardware prefetching or TLB shortage. Our \\emph{Girih}\nframework includes an auto-tuner to select optimal parameter configurations on\nthe target hardware. We conduct performance experiments on two contemporary\nIntel processors and compare with the state-of-the-art stencil frameworks PLUTO\nand Pochoir, using four corner-case stencil schemes and a wide range of problem\nsizes. \\emph{Girih} shows substantial performance advantages and best\narithmetic intensity at almost all problem sizes, especially on low-intensity\nstencils with variable coefficients. We study in detail the performance\nbehavior at varying grid size using phenomenological performance modeling.
