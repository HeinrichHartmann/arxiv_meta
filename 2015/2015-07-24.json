Here, we demonstrate that the tunnel magneto-Seebeck\neffect (TMS) in CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB tunnel junctions can be switched on to a logic\n1 state and off to 0 by simply changing the magnetic state of the CoFeB\nelectrodes. We enable this new functionality of magnetic tunnel junctions by\ncombining a thermal gradient and an electric field. This new technique unveils\nthe bias-enhanced tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect, which can serve as the basis\nfor logic devices or memories in a green information technology with a pure\nthermal write and read process. Furthermore, the thermally generated voltages\nthat are referred to as the Seebeck effect are well known to sensitively depend\non the electronic structure and therefore have been valued in solid-state\nphysics for nearly one hundred years. Here, we lift Seebeck's historic\ndiscovery from 1821 to a new level of current spintronics. Our results show\nthat the signal crosses zero and can be adjusted by tuning a bias voltage that\nis applied between the electrodes of the junction; hence, the name of the\neffect is bias-enhanced tunnel magneto-Seebeck effect (bTMS). Via the spin- and\nenergy-dependent transmission of electrons in the junction, the bTMS effect can\nbe configured using the bias voltage with much higher control than the tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) and even completely suppressed for only one magnetic\nconfiguration, which is either parallel (P) or anti-parallel (AP). This option\nallows a readout contrast for the magnetic information of -3000% at room\ntemperature while maintaining a large signal for one magnetic orientation. This\ncontrast is much larger than the value that can be obtained using the TMR\neffect.

A major limitation of\nprevious approaches is their inability to handle conditional and synergistic\ninteractions that emerge when collectively analysing genes subject to different\nregulatory mechanisms. This limitation reduces overall predictive power and\nthus the reliability of downstream biological inference.\n  Results: We introduce an analytical modelling framework (TREEOME: tree of\nmodels of expression) that integrates epigenetic and transcriptomic data by\nseparating genes into putative regulatory classes. Current predictive modelling\napproaches have found both DNA methylation and histone modification epigenetic\ndata to provide little or no improvement in accuracy of prediction of\ntranscript abundance despite, for example, distinct anti-correlation between\nmRNA levels and promoter-localised DNA methylation. To improve on this, in\nTREEOME we evaluate four possible methods of formulating gene-level DNA\nmethylation metrics, which provide a foundation for identifying gene-level\nmethylation events and subsequent differential analysis, whereas most previous\ntechniques operate at the level of individual CpG dinucleotides.

The\nlower dimensionality of this model means that full numerical field calculations\nare possible, and static multi-solitons and solitons at finite density were\nboth investigated, in particular the baryonic popcorn phase transitions at high\ndensities. Here we present and investigate an alternative lower-dimensional\nanalogue of the Sakai-Sugimoto model in which the Sakai-Sugimoto soliton is\nreplaced by an $O(3)$-sigma model instanton in a warped three-dimensional\nspacetime stabilised by a massive vector meson. A more detailed range of\nbaryonic popcorn phase transitions are found, and the low-dimensional model is\nused as a testing ground to check the validity of common approximations made in\nthe full five-dimensional model, namely approximating fields using their\nflat-space equations of motion, and performing a leading order expansion in the\nmetric.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures"]}]

More specifically, we preassign (simple) fair portions to o(n)\nplayers in o(n)-time, and minimize the damage to the rest of the players. All\ncurrently known algorithms require Omega(n)-time, even when assigning a portion\nto just one player, and it is nontrivial to revise these algorithms to run in\n$o(n)$-time since many of the remaining players, who have not been asked any\nqueries, may not be satisfied with the remaining cake. To challenge this\nproblem, we begin by providing a framework for solving the cake-cutting problem\nin sublinear-time. Generally speaking, solving a problem in sublinear-time\nrequires the use of approximations. However, in our framework, we introduce the\nconcept of \"eps n-victims,\" which means that eps n players (victims) may not\nget fair portions, where 0< eps =< 1 is an arbitrary constant. In our\nframework, an algorithm consists of the following two parts: In the first\n(Preassigning) part, it distributes fair portions to r < n players in\no(n)-time. In the second (Completion) part, it distributes fair portions to the\nremaining n-r players except for the eps n victims in poly}(n)-time.

Here three\nvariants of approximate learning will be introduced and investigated with\nrespect to the question whether they can be combined with partial learning.\nFollowing the line of Fulk and Jain's research, further investigations provide\nconditions under which partial language learners can eventually output only\nfinite variants of the target language. The combinabilities of other partial\nlearning criteria will also be briefly studied.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]

Due to its high temperature,\nthe protolunar disk may act as a thermochemical reactor in which the material\nis processed before being incorporated into the Moon. Outstanding issues like\ndevolatilisation and istotopic evolution are tied to the disk evolution,\nhowever its lifetime, dynamics and thermodynamics are unknown. Here, we\nnumerically explore the long term viscous evolution of the protolunar disk\nusing a one dimensional model where the different phases (vapor and condensed)\nare vertically stratified. Viscous heating, radiative cooling, phase\ntransitions and gravitational instability are accounted for whereas Moon s\naccretion is not considered for the moment. The viscosity of the gas, liquid\nand solid phases dictates the disk evolution. We find that (1) the vapor\ncondenses into liquid in about 10 years, (2) a large fraction of the disk mass\nflows inward forming a hot and compact liquid disk between 1 and 1.7 Earth s\nradii, a region where the liquid is gravitationally stable and can accumulate,\n(3) the disk finally solidifies in 1000 to 100,000 years. Viscous heating is\nnever balanced by radiative cooling. If the vapor phase is abnormally viscous,\ndue to magneto-rotational instability for instance, most of the disk volatile\ncomponents are transported to Earth leaving a disk enriched in refractory\nelements. This opens a way to form a volatile-depleted Moon and would suggest\nthat the missing Moon s volatiles are buried today into the Earth. The disk\ncooling timescale may be long enough to allow for planet-disk isotopic\nequilibration. However large uncertainties on the disk physics remain because\nof the complexity of its multi-phased structure.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ICARUS"]}]

As\na consequence, we are able to provide lower bounds on the computational power\nan attacker needs in order to benefit from selfish mining.

First, we provide a set-theoretic model in\nthe form of a a causal case graph, that is a labeled transition system where\nstates and transitions represent markings and firings of the net, respectively,\nand are equipped with causal information.

To address this issue, several approaches\nthat train SVMs on many small chunks of large data sets separately have been\nproposed in the literature. So far, however, almost all these approaches have\nonly been empirically investigated. In addition, their motivation was always\nbased on computational requirements. In this work, we consider a localized SVM\napproach based upon a partition of the input space. For this local SVM, we\nderive a general oracle inequality. Then we apply this oracle inequality to\nleast squares regression using Gaussian kernels and deduce local learning rates\nthat are essentially minimax optimal under some standard smoothness assumptions\non the regression function. This gives the first motivation for using local\nSVMs that is not based on computational requirements but on theoretical\npredictions on the generalization performance. We further introduce a\ndata-dependent parameter selection method for our local SVM approach and show\nthat this method achieves the same learning rates as before. Finally, we\npresent some larger scale experiments for our localized SVM showing that it\nachieves essentially the same test performance as a global SVM for a fraction\nof the computational requirements.
