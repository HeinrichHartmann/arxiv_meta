We then study the relationship between the three properties using\nvarious plane-fitting techniques (Lara-Lopez et al.) and a curve-fitting\nprojection (Mannucci et al.). In all cases, we exclude strong dependence of the\nM-Z relation on SFR, but are unable to distinguish between moderate and no\ndependence. Our results are consistent with previous mass-metallicity-SFR\nstudies. We check whether dataset limitations may obscure a strong dependence\non the SFR by using mock samples drawn from the SDSS. These experiments reveal\nthat the adopted signal-to-noise cuts may have a significant effect on the\nmeasured dependence. Further work is needed to investigate these results, and\nto test whether a \"fundamental metallicity relation\" or a \"fundamental plane\"\ndescribes star-forming galaxies across cosmic time.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal.

For plant traits heritability is\ntraditionally estimated by comparing within and between genotype variability.\nThis approach estimates broad-sense heritability, and does not account for\ndifferent genetic relatedness. With the availability of high-density markers\nthere is growing interest in marker based estimates of narrow-sense\nheritability, using mixed models in which genetic relatedness is estimated from\ngenetic markers. Such estimates have received much attention in human genetics\nbut are rarely reported for plant traits. A major obstacle is that current\nmethodology and software assume a single phenotypic value per genotype, hence\nrequiring genotypic means. An alternative that we propose here, is to use mixed\nmodels at individual plant or plot level. Using statistical arguments,\nsimulations and real data we investigate the feasibility of both approaches,\nand how these affect genomic prediction with G-BLUP and genome-wide association\nstudies. Heritability estimates obtained from genotypic means had very large\nstandard errors and were sometimes biologically unrealistic. Mixed models at\nindividual plant or plot level produced more realistic estimates, and for\nsimulated traits standard errors were up to 13 times smaller. Genomic\nprediction was also improved by using these mixed models, with up to a 49%\nincrease in accuracy. For GWAS on simulated traits, the use of individual plant\ndata gave almost no increase in power.

The\nmost known image enhancement method is the histogram equalization. This method\nis an automated one, and realizes a simultaneous modification for brightness\nand contrast in the case of monochrome images and for brightness, contrast,\nsaturation and hue in the case of color images. Simple and efficient methods\ncan be obtained if affine transforms within logarithmic models are used. A very\nimportant thing in the affine transform determination for color images is the\ncoordinate system that is used for color space representation. Thus, the using\nof the RGB coordinates leads to a simultaneous modification of luminosity and\nsaturation. In this paper using the lrgb perceptual coordinates one can define\naffine transforms, which allow a separated modification of luminosity l and\nsaturation s (saturation being calculated with the component rgb in the\nchromatic plane). Better results can be obtained if partitions are defined on\nthe image support and then the pixels are separately processed in each window\nbelonging to the defined partition. Classical partitions frequently lead to the\nappearance of some discontinuities at the boundaries between these windows. In\norder to avoid all these drawbacks the classical partitions may be replaced by\nfuzzy partitions. Their elements will be fuzzy windows and in each of them\nthere will be defined an affine transform induced by parameters using the fuzzy\nmean, fuzzy variance and fuzzy saturation computed for the pixels that belong\nto the analyzed window. The final image is obtained by summing up in a weight\nway the images of every fuzzy window.\n"]}]

Moreover, the electrical\nfield from the polar layers is inversion-symmetry breaking and generates a\nRashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in the interfacial electronic system. We\ninvestigate the quantum capacitance of a heterostructure in which a sizeable\nRSOC at a metallic interface is controlled by the electric field of a surface\nelectrode. Such a structure is, for example, given by a LaAlO_3 film on a\nSrTiO_3 substrate which is gated by a top electrode. Such heterostructures can\nexhibit a strong enhancement of their capacitance [Li et al., Science 332, 825\n(2011)]. The capacitance is related to the electronic compressibility of the\nheterostructure, but the two quantities are not equivalent. In fact, the\ntransfer of charge to the interface controls the relation between capacitance\nand compressibility. We find that due to a strong RSOC, the quantum capacitance\ncan be larger than the classical geometric value. However, in contrast to the\nresults of recent investigations [Caprara et al., Phys. Rev.
