However, in certain computational\nbiology scenarios, such as the cancer data analysis, employing RBMs to model\ndata features may lose its efficacy due to the \"$p\\gg N$\" problem, in which the\nnumber of features/predictors is much larger than the sample size.

Reducing these uncertainties is critical for\nstake-holders to make risk-informed decisions based on numerical simulations.\nFor example, Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are\nincreasingly used in mission-critical systems involving turbulent flows.\nHowever, for many practical flows the RANS predictions have large model-form\nuncertainties originating from the uncertainty in the modeled Reynolds\nstresses.

However, in the design stage of engineering systems,\nmeasurement data are usually not available. In the present work we extend the\noriginal framework to scenarios where there are no available data on the flow\nto be predicted. In the proposed method, we first calibrate the model\ndiscrepancy on a related flow with available data, leading to a statistical\nmodel for the uncertainty distribution of the Reynolds stress discrepancy.

The merits of the proposed method are\ndemonstrated on two flows that are challenging to standard RANS models. By not\nrequiring observation data on the flow to be predicted, the present\ncalibration-prediction method will gain wider acceptance in practical\nengineering application.

Most of the\nprior literature focuses on the reduction of load in the backhaul and core\nnetworks due to caching, i.e., on the benefits caching offers for the wireline\ncommunication link between the origin server and the caches. In this paper, we\nare instead interested in the benefits caching can offer for the wireless\ncommunication link between the caches and the end users.\n  To quantify the gains of caching for this wireless link, we consider an\ninterference channel in which each transmitter is equipped with an isolated\ncache memory.

In our proposed scheme, load\nbalancing is achieved through a specific file splitting and placement,\nproducing a particular pattern of content overlap at the caches. This overlap\nallows to implement interference cancellation.

The thesis consists of two parts. The first part\nintroduces stochastic thermodynamics, the second part aims at transferring the\nconcepts of stochastic thermodynamics to developed turbulence. / Central in\nstochastic thermodynamics are Markov processes. An elementary example is\nBrownian motion. In contrast to macroscopic thermodynamics, the work done and\nthe entropy produced for single trajectories of the Brownian particles are\nrandom quantities. Statistical properties of such fluctuating quantities are\ncentral in the field of stochastic thermodynamics. Prominent results are\nso-called fluctuation theorems which express the balance between production and\nconsumption of entropy and generalise the second law. / Turbulent cascades of\neddies are assumed to be the predominant mechanism of turbulence generation and\nfix the statistical properties of developed turbulent flows. An intriguing\nphenomenon of developed turbulence, known as small-scale intermittency, are\nviolent small-scale fluctuations in flow velocity that exceed any Gaussian\nprediction. / In analogy to Brownian motion, it is demonstrated in the thesis\nhow the assumption of the Markov property leads to a Markov process for the\nturbulent cascade that is equivalent to the seminal K62 model. In addition to\nthe K62 model, it is demonstrated how many other models of turbulence can be\nwritten as a Markov process, including scaling laws, multiplicative cascades,\nmultifractal models and field-theoretic approaches. Based on the various Markov\nprocesses, the production of entropy along the cascade and the corresponding\nfluctuation theorems is discussed. In particular, experimental data indicates\nthat entropy consumption is linked to small-scale intermittency, and a\nconnection between entropy consumption and an inverse cascade is suggestive.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, revised version, comments welcome"]}]

A time-reversal procedure, involving the invertion of the\nsigns of every energy and interaction, should produce an excitation revival:\nthe Loschmidt echo (LE).

These perturbations enhance diffusion and evenly\ndistribute the excitation throughout the system. Such a dynamical paradigm,\ncalled ergodicity, breaks down when either the disorder or the interactions are\ntoo strong. These extreme regimes give rise to the well known Anderson\nlocalization and Mott insulating phases, where quantum diffusion becomes\nrestricted. Accordingly, regardless of the kinetic energy terms, the excitation\nremains mainly localized and out-of-equilibrium, and the system behaves\nnon-ergodically. The LE constitutes a fair dynamical witness for the whole\nphase diagram since it evidences a surprising topography in which ergodic and\nnon-ergodic phases interpenetrate each other.
