In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding\n`scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest for\nunderstanding the intensity of the preferences.\n  In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation\nalgorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pair-wise\ncomparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the\ngraph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are\ncompared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to\nbe its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of\nthe algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model\n(equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pair-wise comparisons) in which\neach object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes\nof pair-wise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pair-wise marginal\nprobabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the\nBTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the\nscores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In\nparticular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high\nprobability depends on the structure of the comparison graph.

The Boltzmann equation is solved by means of a\nChapman-Enskog-like expansion around the (local) shear flow distributions\n$f_r^{(0)}$ for each species that retain all the hydrodynamic orders in the\nshear rate. Due to the anisotropy induced by the shear flow, tensorial\nquantities are required to describe the transport processes instead of the\nconventional scalar coefficients. These tensors are given in terms of the\nsolutions of a set of coupled equations, which can be analytically solved as\nfunctions of the shear rate $a$, the coefficients of restitution $\\alpha_{rs}$\nand the parameters of the mixture (masses, diameters and composition). Since\nthe reference distribution functions $f_r^{(0)}$ apply for arbitrary values of\nthe shear rate and are not restricted to weak dissipation, the corresponding\ngeneralized coefficients turn out to be nonlinear functions of both $a$ and\n$\\alpha_{rs}$.

Tools for integrating\nthese measurements into severity scores, that accurately track changes in\nillness severity, can improve clinicians ability to provide timely\ninterventions. Existing approaches for creating such scores either 1) rely on\nexperts to fully specify the severity score, or 2) train a predictive score,\nusing supervised learning, by regressing against a surrogate marker of severity\nsuch as the presence of downstream adverse events. The first approach does not\nextend to diseases where an accurate score cannot be elicited from experts. The\nsecond approach often produces scores that suffer from bias due to\ntreatment-related censoring (Paxton, 2013). We propose a novel ranking based\nframework for disease severity score learning (DSSL). DSSL exploits the\nfollowing key observation: while it is challenging for experts to quantify the\ndisease severity at any given time, it is often easy to compare the disease\nseverity at two different times. Extending existing ranking algorithms, DSSL\nlearns a function that maps a vector of patient's measurements to a scalar\nseverity score such that the resulting score is temporally smooth and\nconsistent with the expert's ranking of pairs of disease states. We apply DSSL\nto the problem of learning a sepsis severity score using a large, real-world\ndataset. The learned scores significantly outperform state-of-the-art clinical\nscores in ranking patient states by severity and in early detection of future\nadverse events. We also show that the learned disease severity trajectories are\nconsistent with clinical expectations of disease evolution.

In this historical gedanken experiment an entropy-bearing box is\nlowered into a charged Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. For the GSL to work,\nthe resulting increase in the black-hole surface area (entropy) must compensate\nfor the loss of the box's entropy. We show that if the box can be lowered\nadiabatically all the way down to the black-hole horizon, as previously assumed\nin the literature, then for near-extremal black holes the resulting increase in\nblack-hole surface-area (due to the assimilation of the box by the black hole)\nmay become too small to compensate for the loss of the box's entropy.

When applied to current supernova\ndata, the associated corrections tend however to improve the agreement between\nthe cosmological parameters inferred from the Hubble diagram and from the\ncosmic microwave background. This is a hint that the effect of small-scale\nstructures on light propagation may become non-negligible in the era of\nprecision cosmology. This motivated the development of a new theoretical\nframework, based on stochastic processes, which aims at describing small-scale\ngravitational lensing with a better accuracy. Regarding the isotropy side of\nthe cosmological principle, this dissertation addresses, on the one hand, the\npotential effect of a large-scale anisotropy on light propagation, by solving\nall the equations of geometric optics in the Bianchi I spacetime. On the other\nhand, possible sources of such an anisotropy, namely scalar-vector models for\ninflation or dark energy, are analysed. Most of them turn out to be excluded as\nphysically viable theories.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, 344 pages, contains preprint versions of the articles\n  arXiv:1302.5308, arXiv:1304.7791, arXiv:1402.3123, arXiv:1406.6254,\n  arXiv:1410.8473, and arXiv:1508.07903"]}]

The suppression of small-scale turbulent fluctuations leads to more\ncoherent thermal plumes that result in the heat transport enhancement. The fact\nthat polymer additives can increase the coherency of thermal plumes is\nsupported by the measurements of a number of local quantities, such as the\nextracted plume amplitude and width, the velocity autocorrelation functions and\nthe velocity-temperature cross-correlation coefficient. The results from local\nmeasurements also suggest the existence of a threshold value for the polymer\nconcentration, only above which can significant modification of the plume\ncoherent properties and enhancement of the local heat flux be observed.\nEstimation of the plume emission rate suggests that the second effect of\npolymer additives is to stabilize the thermal boundary layers.\n","Comment: 8 figures, 11 pages"]}]

First, the main results on the\nconstruction of the weak solutions and on their asymptotic behavior are\nreviewed and structured so that all the cases can be treated in one concise\nway. Most of the open problems are linked with the case of a vanishing velocity\nfield at infinity and this will be the main subject of the remainder of this\nstudy. The linearization of the Navier-Stokes around the zero solution leads to\nthe Stokes equations which are ill-posed in two dimensions. It is the\nwell-known Stokes paradox which states that if the net force is nonzero, the\nsolution of the Stokes equations will grow at infinity. By studying the link\nbetween the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, it is proven that even if the\nnet force vanishes, the velocity and pressure fields of the Navier-Stokes\nequations cannot be asymptotic to those of the Stokes equations. However, the\nvelocity field can be in some cases asymptotic to two exact solutions of the\nStokes equations which also solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, a\nformal asymptotic expansion at infinity for the solutions of the\ntwo-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations having a nonzero net force is\nestablished based physical arguments. The leading term of the velocity field in\nthis expansion decays like $|\\boldsymbol{x}|^{-1/3}$ and exhibits a wake\nbehavior. Numerical simulations are performed to validate this asymptotic\nexpansion when is net force is nonzero and to analyze the asymptotic behavior\nin the case where the net force is vanishing. This indicates that the\nNavier-Stokes equations admit solutions whose velocity field goes to zero at\ninfinity in contrast to the Stokes linearization and moreover this shows that\nthe set of possible asymptotes is very rich.\n","Comment: 88 pages, 21 figures"]}]
