Recent\nexperiments with ultracold atomic gases have reached the interaction strength\nfor which theoretical models have predicted the occurrence of the\nnormal-to-itinerant-ferromagnetic phase transition, but so far this transition\nhas not been observed. The instability of the repulsive branch of the Feshbach\nresonance prevents the formation of the itinerant ferromagnetic state, but it\nis not clear whether this is the only instability impeding its experimental\nrealization. In this article, we use the path-integral formalism with density\nfields in the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to study the stability of a\nhomogeneous two-component Fermi gas with contact interactions. Within the\nsaddle-point approximation we show that none of the extrema of the action are\nminima, meaning all extrema are unstable to small density fluctuations. This\nimplies a more general mechanical instability of the polarized (itinerant\nferromagnetic) and normal states of the system in the path-integral formalism.\nWe find that it is important to consider the stability of the system when\nstudying itinerant ferromagnetism.

In addition, the package contains several functions for simulation and\nvisualization, as well as two multivariate datasets taken from the literature\nand are used to describe the package capabilities. The paper includes a brief\noverview of the statistical methods which have been implemented in the package.\nThe main body of the paper explains how to use the package. Furthermore, we\nillustrate the package's functionality in both real and artificial examples, as\nwell as in an extensive simulation study.\n"]}]

Inspired by the model of\ninterpersonal synergy, we critically investigate the presence, temporal\ndevelopment, possible mechanisms and impact of shared interpersonal heart rate\ndynamics during individual and collective creative LEGO construction tasks. In\nStudy 1 we show how shared HR dynamics are driven by a plurality of sources\nincluding task constraints and behavioral coordination. Generally, shared HR\ndynamics are more prevalent in individual trials (involving participants doing\nthe same things) than in collective ones (involving participants taking turns\nand performing complementary actions). However, when contrasted against virtual\npairs, collective trials display more stable shared HR dynamics suggesting that\nonline social interaction plays an important role. Furthermore, in contrast to\nindividual trials, shared HR dynamics are found to increase across collective\ntrials. Study 2 investigates which aspects of social interaction might drive\nthese effects. We show that shared HR dynamics are statistically predicted by\ninterpersonal speech and building coordination. In Study 3, we explore the\nrelation between HR dynamics, behavioral coordination, and self-reported\nmeasures of rapport and group competence. While behavioral coordination\npredicts rapport and group competence, shared HR dynamics do not. Although\nshared physiological dynamics were reliably observed in our study, our results\nwarrant not to consider HR dynamics a general driving mechanism of social\ncoordination.

We extend the analysis by including terms in\nthe 2HDM potential that break the $Z_2$ symmetry of the potential by\ndimension-4 operators and show that the conclusions remain unchanged.\nFurthermore, a one-loop analysis of the potential is performed for both cases,\nnamely, where the $Z_2$ symmetry of the potential is broken by dimension-2 or\ndimension-4 operators. For quantitative analysis, we show our results for the\nType-II 2HDM, qualitative results remaining the same for other 2HDMs. We find\nthat the nature of the vacua from the tree-level analysis does not change; the\nEW vacuum still remains deeper.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, Published in Physical Review D, Title changed\n  in the published version to \"Scalar potential of two-Higgs doublet models\""]}]

In particular, the lattice Boltzmann (LB)\nmethod has evolved from a theoretical novelty to a ubiquitous, versatile and\npowerful computational methodology for both fundamental research and\nengineering applications. It is a kinetic-based mesoscopic approach that\nbridges the microscales and macroscales, which offers distinctive advantages in\nsimulation fidelity and computational efficiency. Applications of the LB method\nhave been found in a wide range of disciplines including physics, chemistry,\nmaterials, biomedicine and various branches of engineering. The present work\nprovides a comprehensive review of the LB method for thermofluids and energy\napplications, focusing on multiphase flows, thermal flows and thermal\nmultiphase flows with phase change. The review first covers the theoretical\nframework of the LB method, revealing the existing inconsistencies and defects\nas well as common features of multiphase and thermal LB models. Recent\ndevelopments in improving the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic consistency,\nreducing the spurious currents, enhancing the numerical stability, etc., are\nhighlighted. These efforts have put the LB method on a firmer theoretical\nfoundation with enhanced LB models that can achieve larger liquid-gas density\nratio, higher Reynolds number and flexible surface tension. Examples of\napplications are provided in fuel cells and batteries, droplet collision,\nboiling heat transfer and evaporation, and energy storage. Finally, further\ndevelopments and future prospect of the LB method are outlined for thermofluids\nand energy applications.\n","Comment: a Review, 127 pages, 28 figures, accepted by Progress in Energy and\n  Combustion Science"]}]

As the mass of the boson star increases, they do\nsuffer tachyonic instability associated with their localization on $S^5$. This\nis opposite to the behaviour of small black holes (dual to equilibrium states\nof ${\\cal N}=4$ SYM) in global $AdS_5$: the latter develop tachyonic\ninstability as they become sufficiently light.

However binary embedding typically requires long codes in\norder to preserve the discriminative power of the input space. Thus binary\ncoding methods traditionally suffer from high computation and storage costs in\nsuch a scenario. To address this problem, we propose Circulant Binary Embedding\n(CBE) which generates binary codes by projecting the data with a circulant\nmatrix. The circulant structure allows us to use Fast Fourier Transform\nalgorithms to speed up the computation. For obtaining $k$-bit binary codes from\n$d$-dimensional data, this improves the time complexity from $O(dk)$ to\n$O(d\\log{d})$, and the space complexity from $O(dk)$ to $O(d)$.\n  We study two settings, which differ in the way we choose the parameters of\nthe circulant matrix. In the first, the parameters are chosen randomly and in\nthe second, the parameters are learned using the data. For randomized CBE, we\ngive a theoretical analysis comparing it with binary embedding using an\nunstructured random projection matrix. The challenge here is to show that the\ndependencies in the entries of the circulant matrix do not lead to a loss in\nperformance. In the second setting, we design a novel time-frequency\nalternating optimization to learn data-dependent circulant projections, which\nalternatively minimizes the objective in original and Fourier domains.

The properties of emitted photons that depend on the\nlarge electron wavefunction extents in the wetting layer indicate that the\ncoupling occurs between systems of different dimensionality, which is also\nverified from the results obtained by applying a magnetic field in different\nconfigurations. This study paves a new way to observe hybrid states with zero-\nand two-dimensional structures, which could be useful for investigating the\nKondo physics and implementing spin-based solid-state quantum information\nprocessing.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures in Nano Research, 2015"]}]
