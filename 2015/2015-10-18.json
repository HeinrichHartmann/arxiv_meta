This scheme is quite general and\nbrings down the size of the variational space by an order of magnitude or even\nmore in some cases to reproduce the most precise ground state energies and\ncorrelation functions available in the literature. This method has enormous\npotential for application to systems with more electrons or in higher\ndimensions, which are still beyond the reach of exact-diagonalization just\nbecause of the sheer size of their variational space needed to get reasonably\nconvergent results.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to PRB"]}]
