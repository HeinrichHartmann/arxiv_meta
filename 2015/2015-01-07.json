A sequential detection-estimation strategy is adopted, which\nbasically assumes that similar rainfall intensity values and their spectral\nradiances live close to some sufficiently smooth manifolds with analogous local\ngeometry. The detection step employs a nearest neighborhood classification\nrule, while the estimation scheme is equipped with a constrained shrinkage\nestimator to ensure stability of retrieval and some physical consistency. The\nalgorithm is examined using coincidental observations of the active\nprecipitation radar (PR) and passive microwave imager (TMI) on board the\nTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. We present promising\nresults of instantaneous rainfall retrieval for some tropical storms and\nmesoscale convective systems over ocean, land, and coastal zones. We provide\nevidence that the algorithm is capable of properly capturing different storm\nmorphologies including high intensity rain-cells and trailing light rainfall,\nespecially over land and coastal areas. The algorithm is also validated at an\nannual scale for calendar year 2013 versus the standard (version 7) radar\n(2A25) and radiometer (2A12) rainfall products of the TRMM satellite.\n"]}]

We provide an explanation of the excess in terms of\nresummation of large logarithms that arise from a jet-veto condition, i.e., the\nrejection of high-pT jets with pT > pT(veto) that is imposed in the\nexperimental analyses to reduce backgrounds. Jet veto introduces a second mass\nscale pT(veto) to the problem in addition to the invariant mass of the WW pair.\nThis gives rise to large logarithms of the ratio of the two scales that need to\nbe resummed. Such resummation may not be properly accounted for by the Monte\nCarlo simulations used in the ATLAS and CMS studies.

We analytically resum the large logarithms\nincluding the pi^2 terms in the framework of soft collinear effective theory\n(SCET), and demonstrate that the SCET calculation not only reduces the scale\nuncertainties of the SM prediction significantly but also renders the theory\nprediction well compatible with the experiment.

As a result, the binary orbit\nshrinks faster than predicted in General Relativity, modifying the rate of\ndecay of the orbital period.

The position error of 1 mm in a lateral\nplane (plane perpendicular to the beam direction) can result in a dose\ninhomogeneity of more than $5 \\%$. Therefore the goal of Gantry 2 commissioning\nwas to reach a sub-millimeter level of the reconstruction accuracy in order to\nbring a dose uncertainty to a level of $1 \\%$. In fact, we observed that for\nbeams offered by Gantry 2 signal profiles in a lateral plane can be\nreconstructed with a precision of 0.1 mm. This is a necessary criterion to\nperform a reliable patient treatment. The front end electronics and the whole\ndata processing sequence have been optimized for minimizing the dead time in\nbetween two consecutive spots to about 2 ms: the charge collection is performed\nin about 1 ms, read-out takes place in about 100 $\\mu$s while data verification\nand logging are completed in less than 1 ms.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures; the proceedings of the 10th International\n  Conference on Position Sensitive Detectors, JINST Volume 9, December 2014"]}]

With\nordering vectors $(\\pi,0)$ or $(0,\\pi)$, this magnetic state breaks the\nhigh-temperature tetragonal symmetry of the system, which is manifested by a\nsplitting of the lattice Bragg peaks. Remarkably, recent experiments in\nhole-doped iron arsenides reported an ordered state that displays magnetic\nBragg peaks at $(\\pi,0)$ and $(0,\\pi)$ but remains tetragonal.

In particular,\nwe find that strong deviations from perfect nesting and residual interactions\nbetween the electron pockets favor the orthomagnetic over the stripe magnetic\nstate. Using an effective low-energy model, we also calculate the spin-wave\nspectrum of the orthomagnetic state. In contrast to the stripe state, there are\nthree Goldstone modes, manifested in all diagonal and one off-diagonal\ncomponent of the spin-spin correlation function. The total magnetic structure\nfactor displays two anisotropic spin-wave branches emerging from both $(\\pi,0)$\nand $(0,\\pi)$ momenta, in contrast to the case of domains of stripe order,\nwhere only one spin-wave branch emerges from each momentum.

The enormous potential of angular momentum science is only\njust being realised, thanks to the emergence of the first simulations of\ngalaxies with converged spins, paralleled by a dramatic increase in kinematic\nobservations. Such observations are still challenged by the fact that most of\nthe stellar/baryon angular momentum resides at large radii. In fact, the radius\nthat maximally contributes to the angular momentum of an exponential disk\n(3Re-4Re) is twice as large as the radius that maximally contributes to the\ndisk mass; thus converged measurements of angular momentum require either\nextremely deep IFS data or, alternatively, kinematic measurements of neutral\natomic hydrogen (HI), which naturally resides at the large disk radii that\ndominate the angular momentum.

One of the most fundamental,\nbut unanswered questions in the evolution of galaxies is how gas circulates in\nand around galaxies and how it enters the galaxies to support star formation.\nWe have several lines of evidence that the observed evolution of star formation\nrequires gas accretion from the IGM at all times and on all cosmic scales. This\ngas remains largely unaccounted for and the outstanding questions are where\nthis gas resides and what the physical mechanisms of accretion are. The gas is\nexpected to be embedded in an extended cosmic web made of sheets and filaments.\nSuch large-scale filaments of gas are expected by cosmological numerical\nsimulations, which have made significant progress in recent years. Such\nsimulations do not only model the large scale structure of the cosmic web, but\nalso investigate the neutral gas component. To truly make significant progress\nin understanding the distribution of neutral hydrogen in the IGM, column\ndensities of NHI=10^18 cm-2 and below have to be probed over large areas on the\nsky at sub-arcminute resolution. These are the densities of the faintest\nstructures known today around nearby galaxies, though mostly found with single\ndish telescopes which do not have the resolution to resolve these structures\nand investigate any kinematics. Existing interferometers lack the collecting\npower or short baselines to achieve brightness sensitivities typically below\nNHI=10^19 cm-2. Reaching lower column densities with current facilities is\nfeasible, however requires prohibitively long observing times. The SKA will for\nthe first time break these barriers, enabling interferometric observations an\norder of magnitude deeper than current interferometers and with an order of\nmagnitude better linear resolution than single-dish telescopes.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 6 figures, to be published in: \"Advancing Astrophysics with\n  the Square Kilometre Array\", Proceedings of Science, PoS(AASKA14)132"]}]

These\nmultiwavelength datasets will enable studies to move beyond an understanding of\nHI gas in isolation to instead understand HI as an integral part of the highly\ncomplex baryonic processes that drive galaxy evolution.\n  As they evolve, galaxies experience a host of environmental and feedback\ninfluences, many of which can radically impact their gas content. Important\nprocesses include: accretion (hot and cold mode, mergers), depletion (star\nformation, galactic winds, AGN), phase changes (ionised/atomic/molecular), and\nenvironmental effects (ram pressure stripping, tidal effects, strangulation).\nGoverning all of these to various extents is the underlying dark matter\ndistribution. In turn, the result of these processes can significantly alter\nthe baryonic states in which material is finally observed (stellar populations,\ndust, chemistry) and its morphology (galaxy type, bulge/disk ratio, bars,\nwarps, radial profile).

This makes it possible to answer an open question of Vershik\nregarding the existence of a limit shape when the number of vertices is\nconstrained. The method which is used emphasizes the connection of the\ncombinatorial analysis with the zeros of the zeta function. It is shown how the\nRiemann Hypothesis leads to an asymptotic equivalent of the number of convex\nchains.\n","Comment: 28 pages"]}]
