We consider cognitive radio networks where the secondary receivers\nare able to harvest energy from the radio frequency when they are idle. The\nsecondary system provides simultaneous wireless power and secure information\ntransfer to the secondary receivers. We propose a multi-objective optimization\nframework for the design of a Pareto optimal resource allocation algorithm\nbased on the weighted Tchebycheff approach. In particular, the algorithm design\nincorporates three important system objectives: total transmit power\nminimization, energy harvesting efficiency maximization, and interference power\nleakage-to-transmit power ratio minimization. The proposed framework takes into\naccount a quality of service requirement regarding communication secrecy in the\nsecondary system and the imperfection of the channel state information of\npotential eavesdroppers (idle secondary receivers and primary receivers) at the\nsecondary transmitter. The adopted multi-objective optimization problem is\nnon-convex and is recast as a convex optimization problem via semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) relaxation. It is shown that the global optimal solution of\nthe original problem can be constructed by exploiting both the primal and the\ndual optimal solutions of the SDP relaxed problem. Besides, two suboptimal\nresource allocation schemes for the case when the solution of the dual problem\nis unavailable for constructing the optimal solution are proposed.

Correlations between anisotropic flows with varying\npseudorapidity gaps in Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider are\ninvestigated using both an event-by-event (3+1)-D ideal hydrodynamical model\nwith fluctuating initial conditions and the a multiphase transport (AMPT) Monte\nCarlo model for high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Anisotropic flows at\ndifferent pseudorapidities are found to become significantly decorrelated with\nincreasing pseudo-rapidity gaps due to longitudinal fluctuations in the initial\nstates of heavy-ion collisions. The longitudinal correlation of the elliptic\nflow shows a strong centrality dependence while the correlation of the\ntriangular flow is independent of the centrality. Longitudinal fluctuations as\na source of the decorrelation are further shown to consist of a twist or\ngradual rotation in flow angles between the forward and backward direction and\nadditional fluctuations on top of the twist.

To handle fast data, the DSMS is\ncommonly placed on top of a cloud infrastructure.

Even though this signal is expected to\nreplicate the stellar signal, not only is it several orders of magnitude\nfainter, but it is also hidden among the stellar noise. We apply a variant of\nthe cross-correlation technique to HARPS observations of 51 Peg to detect the\nreflected signal from planet 51 Peg b. Our method makes use of the\ncross-correlation function of a binary mask with high-resolution spectra to\namplify the minute planetary signal that is present in the spectra by a factor\nproportional to the number of spectral lines when performing the cross\ncorrelation. The resulting cross-correlation functions are then normalized by a\nstellar template to remove the stellar signal. Carefully selected sections of\nthe resulting normalized CCFs are stacked to increase the planetary signal\nfurther. The recovered signal allows probing several of the planetary\nproperties, including its real mass and albedo. We detect evidence for the\nreflected signal from planet 51 Peg b at a significance of 3\\sigma_noise. The\ndetection of the signal permits us to infer a real mass of 0.46^+0.06_-0.01\nM_Jup (assuming a stellar mass of 1.04\\;M_Sun) for the planet and an orbital\ninclination of 80^+10_-19 degrees. The analysis of the data also allows us to\ninfer a tentative value for the (radius-dependent) geometric albedo of the\nplanet. The results suggest that 51Peg b may be an inflated hot Jupiter with a\nhigh albedo (e.g., an albedo of 0.5 yields a radius of 1.9 \\pm 0.3 R_Jup for a\nsignal amplitude of 6.0\\pm0.4 x 10^-5).

After a short description of the numerous recent\nprogresses in this field, and a brief overview of the theory, we focus on the\nissue of phonon wavevector sampling convergence, until now poorly understood.\nIndeed, the renormalization is obtained numerically through a q-point sampling\ninside the BZ.

Although\nit should vanish for non-polar materials, unphysical residual Born effective\ncharges are usually present in ab-initio calculations. Here, we propose a\nsolution that improves the coupled q-point convergence dramatically. For polar\nmaterials, the problem is more severe: the divergence of the integral does not\ndisappear in the adiabatic harmonic approximation, but only in the\nnon-adiabatic harmonic approximation. In all cases, we study in detail the\nconvergence behavior of the renormalization as the q-point sampling goes to\ninfinity and the imaginary broadening parameter goes to zero.

Companion galaxies in groups tend to have\nlower stellar masses, smaller linear diameters and fainter mean surface\nbrightnesses as the distance to their host decreases.

This difference probably indicates the presence of larger hot/warm gas\nhaloes around the early-type host galaxies.

Estimation of the underlying matrix from\nregularization-based approaches promoting low-rankedness, notably nuclear norm\nregularization, have enjoyed great popularity. In the present paper, we argue\nthat such regularization may no longer be necessary if the underlying matrix is\nsymmetric positive semidefinite (\\textsf{spd}) and the design satisfies certain\nconditions. In this situation, simple least squares estimation subject to an\n\\textsf{spd} constraint may perform as well as regularization-based approaches\nwith a proper choice of the regularization parameter, which entails knowledge\nof the noise level and/or tuning. By contrast, constrained least squares\nestimation comes without any tuning parameter and may hence be preferred due to\nits simplicity.\n"]}]

In addition, there exist\npolynomial-time algorithms that compute exact (coarse) correlated equilibria.\nIn light of these results, a natural question is how good are the (coarse)\ncorrelated equilibria that can arise from any efficient algorithm or dynamics.\n  In this paper we address this question, and establish strong negative\nresults. In particular, we show that in multiplayer games that have a succinct\nrepresentation, it is NP-hard to compute any coarse correlated equilibrium (or\napproximate coarse correlated equilibrium) with welfare strictly better than\nthe worst possible. The focus on succinct games ensures that the underlying\ncomplexity question is interesting; many multiplayer games of interest are in\nfact succinct. Our results imply that, while one can efficiently compute a\ncoarse correlated equilibrium, one cannot provide any nontrivial welfare\nguarantee for the resulting equilibrium, unless P=NP. We show that analogous\nhardness results hold for correlated equilibria, and persist under the\negalitarian objective or Pareto optimality.\n  To complement the hardness results, we develop an algorithmic framework that\nidentifies settings in which we can efficiently compute an approximate\ncorrelated equilibrium with near-optimal welfare. We use this framework to\ndevelop an efficient algorithm for computing an approximate correlated\nequilibrium with near-optimal welfare in aggregative games.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

In the cases of $^{87}$Rb (bosons)\nas well as of $^{40}$K (fermions) trapped in the two hyperfine states, the\nintrinsic $su(2)$ symmetry can be realized with a very good precision. Such a\nsymmetry protects the global operators, which are the generators of the\nsymmetry, from any decoherence. The case of boson-fermion mixture is discussed\nas well. The role of external factors, breaking the symmetry, in inducing the\ndecoherence of the global operators is considered. It is shown that, the loss\nof the correlations is not faster than the rates of the induced heating or\nlosses, provided the noise is characterized by short correlation length. The\ncase of the extrinsic long-ranged fluctuations is also considered. Intrinsic\nmechanisms of decoherence of the correlators of the condensate operators of the\ntwo-component condensate are analyzed. The atomic echo is discussed as a test\nfor the reversibility of the phase diffusion effect. The intensity and the\nprofile of the multiple echo are calculated numerically as well as\nanalytically.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 3 eps figures.
