One of the key\nobjections to the use of T&T to stop transmission concerns the role of the\nacute phase in HIV transmission.

In our global model, windows of increased immigration\nmap to the seasonal timing of epidemic spread, while windows of increased\nemigration map to epidemic decline.

This question is motivated by\nearlier work of A. M. Essin and one of us (M.

This approach does not produce a physical model for each\nsymmetry class, and indeed there are reasons to believe that some symmetry\nclasses may not be realizable in strictly two-dimensional systems, thus raising\nthe question of which classes are in fact possible. While our understanding is\nlimited to a restricted class of models, it is complete in the sense that for\neach of the 2080 possible symmetry classes, we either prove rigorously that the\nclass cannot be realized in our family of models, or we give an explicit model\nrealizing the class.

Here we evaluate\nthe prospects of a wide range of planned and hypothetical radio surveys using\nthe properties and volumetric rates of known and hypothetical classes of\nextragalactic synchrotron radio transients (e.g., on- and off-axis gamma-ray\nbursts [GRB], supernovae, tidal disruption events [TDE], compact object\nmergers). Utilizing these sources and physically motivated considerations we\nassess the allowed phase-space of radio luminosity and peak timescale for\nextragalactic transients. We also include for the first time effects such as\nredshift evolution of the rates, K-corrections, and non-Euclidean luminosity\ndistance, which affect the detection rates of the most sensitive surveys. The\nnumber of detected events is calculated by means of a Monte Carlo method, using\nthe various survey properties (depth, cadence, area) and realistic detection\ncriteria that include a cut on the minimum variability of the transients during\nthe survey and an assessment of host galaxy contamination. Near-term GHz\nfrequency surveys (ASKAP/VAST, Very Large Array Sky Survey) will detect few\nevents: <~30-50 on- and off-axis long GRBs and off-axis tidal disruption\nevents, and ~10-20 neutron star binary mergers if ~1% of the mergers result in\na stable millisecond magnetar. Low-frequency surveys (e.g., LOFAR) are unlikely\nto detect any transients, while a hypothetical large-scale mm survey may detect\n~40 on-axis long GRBs.

The sampling theorem shows that images\nbandlimited to the union of the Nyquist regions of the two rectangular lattices\ncan be recovered from their Manhattan samples, and an efficient procedure for\ndoing so is given.

This paper\npresents a combinatorial rigidity approach to measure (i) generic rigidity and\n(ii) generalized redundant rigidity properties of graph structures through\ngraph invariants for the localization problem in wireless sensor networks. We\ndefine the rigidity index as a graph invariant based on independent set of\nedges in the rigidity matroid. It has a value between 0 and 1, and it indicates\nhow close we are to rigidity. Redundant rigidity is required for global\nrigidity, which is associated with unique realization of graphs. Moreover,\nredundant rigidity also provides rigidity robustness in networked systems\nagainst structural changes, such as link losses. Here, we give a broader\ndefinition of redundant edge that we call the \"generalized redundant edge.\"\nThis definition of redundancy is valid for both rigid and non-rigid graphs.\nNext, we define the redundancy index as a graph invariant based on generalized\nredundant edges in the rigidity matroid. It also has a value between 0 and 1,\nand it indicates the percentage of redundancy in a graph. These two indices\nallow us to explore the transition from non-rigidity to rigidity and the\ntransition from rigidity to redundant rigidity. Examples on graphs are provided\nto demonstrate this approach. From a sensor network point of view, these two\nindices enable us to evaluate the effects of sensing radii of sensors on the\nrigidity properties of networks, which in turn, allow us to examine the\nlocalizability of sensor networks.

This paper aims to address the\nproblem from a new perspective and considers model-oriented dimensionality\nreduction in parameter spaces of binary multivariate distributions.\n  Specifically, we propose a general parameter reduction criterion, called\nConfident-Information-First (CIF) principle, to maximally preserve confident\nparameters and rule out less confident parameters. Formally, the confidence of\neach parameter can be assessed by its contribution to the expected Fisher\ninformation distance within the geometric manifold over the neighbourhood of\nthe underlying real distribution.\n  We then revisit Boltzmann machines (BM) from a model selection perspective\nand theoretically show that both the fully visible BM (VBM) and the BM with\nhidden units can be derived from the general binary multivariate distribution\nusing the CIF principle. This can help us uncover and formalize the essential\nparts of the target density that BM aims to capture and the non-essential parts\nthat BM should discard.

The corresponding term in dynamical\nequations is proportional to $1/|n-m|^{\\alpha+1}$. It is shown that the\nequation of motion in the infrared limit can be transformed into the medium\nequation with the Riesz fractional derivative of order $\\alpha$, when\n$0<\\alpha<2$. We consider few models of coupled oscillators and show how their\nsynchronization can appear as a result of bifurcation, and how the\ncorresponding solutions depend on $\\alpha$. The presence of fractional\nderivative leads also to the occurrence of localized structures. Particular\nsolutions for fractional time-dependent complex Ginzburg-Landau (or nonlinear\nSchrodinger) equation are derived. These solutions are interpreted as\nsynchronized states and localized structures of the oscillatory medium.\n","Comment: 34 pages, 18 figures"]}]

This force originates from a\nmodification of the classical centrifugal force due to the wave nature of the\nparticle. For positive energies the quantum anti-centrifugal force manifests\nitself in a bunching of the nodes of the energy wave functions towards the\norigin. For negative energies this force is sufficient to create a bound state\nin a two-dimensional delta function potential. In a counter-intuitive way the\nattractive force pushes the particle away from the location of the delta\nfunction potential.
