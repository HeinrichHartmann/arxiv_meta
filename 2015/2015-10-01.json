The key to efficiency is that we describe the equations\nof motion for the polymer in terms of the amplitudes of the polymer's\nfluctuation modes, as opposed to the use of the physical positions of the\nbeads.

These relativistic electrons should also emit X-rays through\ninverse-Compton scattering off of cosmic microwave background photons. The\ndetection of such a non-thermal X-ray component, together with the radio\nmeasurement, would permit to clearly separate the magnetic field from the\nrelativistic electron distribution as the inverse-Compton emission is\nindependent from the magnetic field in the cluster. However, non-thermal X-rays\nhave not been conclusively detected from any cluster of galaxies so far. In\nthis paper, for the first time, we model the synchrotron and inverse-Compton\nemission of all clusters hosting radio halos and relics for which the spectral\nindex can be determined. We provide constraints on the volume-average magnetic\nfield by comparing with current X-ray measurements. We then estimate the\nmaximum volume-average magnetic field that will allow the detection of\ninverse-Compton hard X-rays by the ASTRO-H satellite. We found that several\nclusters are good targets for ASTRO-H to detect their inverse-Compton emission,\nin particular that corresponding to radio relics, and propose a list of\npromising targets for which ASTRO-H can test $\\ge1$~$\\mu$G magnetic fields. We\nconclude that future hard X-ray observations by the already-operating NuSTAR\nand the soon-to-be-launched ASTRO-H definitely have the potential to shed light\non the long-sought non-thermal hard-X-ray emission in clusters of galaxies.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures, 9 Tables.

Economic\ndispatching is a central problem in microgrid operation, which aims at\neffectively scheduling various energy sources to minimize the operating cost\nwhile satisfying the electricity demand. Designing intelligent economic\ndispatching strategies for microgrids, however, is drastically different from\nthat for conventional central grids, due to two unique challenges. First, the\nerratic renewable energy emphasizes the need for online algorithms. Second, the\nwidely-adopted peak-based pricing scheme brings out the need for new peak-aware\nstrategy design. In this paper, we tackle these critical challenges and devise\npeak-aware online economic dispatching algorithms. For microgrids with\nfast-responding generators, we prove that our deterministic and randomized\nalgorithms achieve the best possible competitive ratios $2-\\beta$ and\n$e/(e-1+\\beta)$, respectively, where $\\beta\\in[0,1]$ is the ratio between the\nminimum grid spot price and the local-generation price. Our results\ncharacterize the fundamental \\emph{price of uncertainty} of the problem. For\nmicrogrids with slow-responding generators, we first show that a large\ncompetitive ratio is inevitable. Then we leverage limited prediction of\nelectricity demand and renewable generation to improve the competitiveness of\nthe algorithms. By extensive empirical evaluations using real-world traces, we\nshow that our online algorithms achieve near offline-optimal performance. In a\nrepresentative scenario, our algorithm achieves $17.5\\%$ and $9.24\\%$ cost\nreduction as compared to the case without local generation units and the case\nusing peak-oblivious algorithms, respectively.\n"]}]

In order for such a model to\nbe consistent with the current upper limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nthere must be an enhancement of the curvature fluctuations during the bounce\nphase. We show that, while it remains possible to enlarge the amplitude of\ncurvature perturbations due to the nontrivial background evolution, this growth\nis very limited because of the conservation of curvature perturbations on\nsuper-Hubble scales. We further perform a general analysis of the evolution of\nprimordial non-Gaussianities through the bounce phase.

Hence, in such\nnonsingular bounce models with matter given by a single scalar field, there\nappears to be a tension between obtaining a small enough tensor-to-scalar ratio\nand not obtaining a value of $f_{\\mathrm{NL}}$ in excess of the current upper\nbounds.

On the basis of these\nconsiderations, the seismic input at a given site - determined on the basis of\nthe seismic history, the seismogenic zones and the seismogenic nodes - is\ndefined using the Neo Deterministic Seismic Hazard Assessment (NDSHA). Two\ndifferent analysis are carried out at different levels of detail. The first one\n(RSA) provides the Maximum Deterministic Seismic Input as a response spectra at\nthe bedrock (MDSIBD), similarly to what is proposed by the codes. The second\none (SSA) takes the site effects into account, providing a site specific\nseismic input (MDSISS). A SSA provides realistic site specific seismograms that\ncould be used to run time history analysis even where no registrations are\navailable. Reviewing the standard PBD procedure, MDSISS is always associated\nwith the worst structural performance acceptable for a building, called Target\nPerformance Level (TPL). In this way, the importance of the structure (risk\ncategory) is taken into account by changing the structural performance level to\ncheck rather than to change the seismic input.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 12 figures, to be published in the XVI ANIDIS Conference\n  proceedings (13-17 September 2015, L'Aquila, Italy)"]}]

Not surprisingly, cells encode diverse\nregulatory mechanisms to buffer noise. One such mechanism is the incoherent\nfeedforward circuit. We analyze a simplistic version of this circuit, where an\nupstream regulator X affects both the production and degradation of a protein\nY. Thus, any random increase in X's copy numbers would increase both production\nand degradation, keeping Y levels unchanged. To study its stochastic dynamics,\nwe formulate this network into a mathematical model using the Chemical Master\nEquation formulation. We prove that if the functional dependence of Y's\nproduction and degradation on X is similar, then the steady-distribution of Y's\ncopy numbers is independent of X. To investigate how fluctuations in Y\npropagate downstream, a protein Z whose production rate only depend on Y is\nintroduced. Intriguingly, results show that the extent of noise in Z increases\nwith noise in X, in spite of the fact that the magnitude of noise in Y is\ninvariant of X. Such counter intuitive results arise because X enhances the\ntime-scale of fluctuations in Y, which amplifies fluctuations in downstream\nprocesses. In summary, while feedforward systems can buffer a protein from\nnoise in its upstream regulators, noise can propagate downstream due to changes\nin the time-scale of fluctuations.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

In this paper, we investigate how the mobile users (MUs) can\neffectively offload traffic by taking advantage of the capability of\ndual-connectivity, which enables an MU to simultaneously communicate with a\nmacro base station (BS) and a small-cell access point (AP) via two\nradio-interfaces. Offloading traffic to the AP usually reduces the MUs' mobile\ndata cost, but often at the expense of suffering increased interferences from\nother MUs at the same AP. We thus formulate an optimization problem that\njointly determines each MU's traffic schedule (between the BS and AP) and power\ncontrol (between two radio-interfaces). The system objective is to minimize all\nMUs' total cost, while satisfying each MU's transmit-power constraints through\nproper interference control.
