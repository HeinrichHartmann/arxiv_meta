Here we modify the approach in [Gramfort et\nal., 2013] to produce an STFT-based source localization method (STFT-R) that\nincludes an additional regression of the STFT components on covariates such as\nthe behavioral learning curve. We also exploit a hierarchical L 21 penalty to\ninduce structured sparsity of STFT components and to emphasize signals from\nregions of interest (ROIs) that are selected according to prior knowl- edge. In\nreconstructing the ROI source signals from simulated data, STFT-R achieved\nsmaller errors than a two-step method using the popular minimum-norm estimate\n(MNE), and in a real-world human learning experiment, STFT-R yielded more\ninterpretable results about what time-frequency components of the ROI signals\nwere correlated with learning.\n","Comment: Author manuscript accepted to 4th NIPS Workshop on Machine Learning\n  and Interpretation in Neuroimaging (2014), (in press on Lecture Notes in\n  Computer Science, by Springer)"]}]

Despite their importance in uncovering the genetic structure of\ncomplex traits, the statistical methods for identifying epistasis in multiple\nphenotypes remains fundamentally unexplored. To fill this gap, we formulate a\ntest for interaction between two gens in multiple quantitative trait analysis\nas a multiple functional regression (MFRG) in which the genotype functions\n(genetic variant profiles) are defined as a function of the genomic position of\nthe genetic variants. We use large scale simulations to calculate its type I\nerror rates for testing interaction between two genes with multiple phenotypes\nand to compare its power with multivariate pair-wise interaction analysis and\nsingle trait interaction analysis by a single variate functional regression\nmodel.

Although many state-of-the-art algorithms have\nachieved decent performances, a plurality of existing methods solve the problem\nonly in instance level rather than excavating relations among bags. In this\npaper, we propose an efficient algorithm to describe each bag by a\ncorresponding feature vector via comparing it with other bags. In other words,\nthe crucial information of a bag is extracted from the similarity between that\nbag and other reference bags. In addition, we apply extensions of Hausdorff\ndistance to representing the similarity, to a certain extent, overcoming the\nkey challenge of MIL problem, the ambiguity of instances' labels in positive\nbags. Experimental results on benchmarks and text categorization tasks show\nthat the proposed method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by a large\nmargin.\n"]}]

These problems often mean that\nvisually impaired people travel less, which influences their personal and\nprofessional life and can lead to exclusion from society. Therefore this issue\npresents a social challenge as well as an important research area. Accessible\ngeographic maps are helpful for acquiring knowledge about a city's or\nneighborhood's configuration, as well as selecting a route to reach a\ndestination. Traditionally, raised-line paper maps with braille text have been\nused. These maps have proved to be efficient for the acquisition of spatial\nknowledge by visually impaired people. Yet, these maps possess significant\nlimitations. For instance, due to the specificities of the tactile sense only a\nlimited amount of information can be displayed on a single map, which\ndramatically increases the number of maps that are needed. For the same reason,\nit is difficult to represent specific information such as distances. Finally,\nbraille labels are used for textual descriptions but only a small percentage of\nthe visually impaired population reads braille. In France 15% of blind people\nare braille readers and only 10% can read and write. In the United States,\nfewer than 10% of the legally blind people are braille readers and only 10% of\nblind children actually learn braille.

The results\nshow that the stationary process is closely related to data-center locations\nand CSPs involved in transfers, which fortunately makes both the Cloud more\npredictable and the set of reported measurements extrapolate. On the other\nhand, although the correlation in the Cloud is low, i.e., only 10% of the\nmeasured pair of paths showed some correlation, we have found evidence that\nsuch correlation depends on the particular relationships between pairs of\ndata-centers with little link to more general factors.

This ultrametric distance is shown to be\ndifferent than the matrix obtasined from feaures. It is shown that the\ndefinition of c-commabnd can be replaced by an equivalent ultrametric\ndefinition. The new definition invokes a minimum distance between nodes and\nthis is more aesthetically satisfing than previouv varieties of definitions.\n  From the new definition of c-command follows a new definition of government.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 55508 bytes, 16 eps diagrams, 39 references, some small\n  changes from the previous version, matrices reset, background to this work\n  can be found at:\n  http://cosmology.mth.uct.ac.za/~roberts/pastresearch/ultrametric.html"]}]
