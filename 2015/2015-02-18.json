Our results are based on the fact\nthat the Markov chain provides an asymptotic probability distribution for the\nrecurrent states, which can be used to obtain averages of observables as well\nas the time variation of these magnitudes during succession, in an exact\nmanner. Since the absorption times into the recurrent set are found to be\ncomparable to the size of the system, the end state is quickly reached (in\nunits of the invasion time). Thus, the final ecosystem can be regarded as a\nfluctuating complex system where species are continually replaced by newcomers\nwithout ever leaving the set of recurrent patterns. The assembly graph is\ndominated by pathways in which most invasions are accepted, triggering small\nextinction avalanches.

Although commonly used, little is\nknown about the inner mechanisms of chest physiotherapy and controversies about\nits use are coming out regularly. Thus, a scientific validation of chest\nphysiotherapy is needed to evaluate its effects on secretions.\n  We setup a quasi-static numerical model of chest physiotherapy based on\nthorax and lung physiology and on their respective biophysics. We modeled the\nlung with an idealized deformable symmetric bifurcating tree. Bronchi and their\ninner fluids mechanics are assumed axisymmetric. Static data from the\nliterature is used to build a model for the lung's mechanics. Secretions motion\nis the consequence of the shear constraints apply by the air flow. The input of\nthe model is the pressure on the chest wall at each time, and the output is the\nbronchi geometry and air and secretions properties.\n  In the limit of our model, we mimicked manual and mechanical chest\nphysiotherapy techniques. We show that for secretions to move, air flow has to\nbe high enough to overcome secretion resistance to motion. Moreover, the higher\nthe pressure or the quicker it is applied, the higher is the air flow and thus\nthe mobilization of secretions. However, pressures too high are efficient up to\na point where airways compressions prevents air flow to increases any further.\nGenerally, the first effects of manipulations is a decrease of the airway tree\nhydrodynamic resistance, thus improving ventilation even if secretions do not\nget out of the lungs. Also, some secretions might be pushed deeper into the\nlungs; this effect is stronger for high pressures and for mechanical chest\nphysiotherapy.

However, this is rare\nin practice, and almost every non-trivial software system relies heavily on the\nuse of libraries of reusable components. Recently, Lustig and Vardi introduced\ndataflow and controlflow synthesis from libraries of reusable components. They\nproved that dataflow synthesis is undecidable, while controlflow synthesis is\ndecidable. The problem of controlflow synthesis from libraries of probabilistic\ncomponents was considered by Nain, Lustig and Vardi, and was shown to be\ndecidable for qualitative analysis (that asks that the specification be\nsatisfied with probability 1). Our main contributions for controlflow synthesis\nfrom probabilistic components are to establish better complexity bounds for the\nqualitative analysis problem, and to show that the more general quantitative\nproblem is undecidable. For the qualitative analysis, we show that the problem\n(i) is EXPTIME-complete when the specification is given as a deterministic\nparity word automaton, improving the previously known 2EXPTIME upper bound; and\n(ii) belongs to UP $\\cap$ coUP and is parity-games hard, when the specification\nis given directly as a parity condition on the components, improving the\npreviously known EXPTIME upper bound.\n"]}]

In particular, by using ergodic and dynamical\nmethods, a new insight to problems concerning the asymptotic behaviour of\nmultidimensional sequences can be given, and a criterion to construct new\nmultidimensional uniformly distributed sequences is provided. The starting\npoint to do this, is to look at the orbit, i.e. the sequence of iterates, of a\nuniquely ergodic transformation T defined on [0,1]. The unique ergodicity of\nthe transformation has the following consequence: the orbit of x under T is a\nuniformly distributed sequence. We devoted the first chapter entirely on\nclassical topics in uniform distribution theory (UDT) and ergodic theory. This\nprovides the basic requirements for a complete understanding of the following\nchapters, even to a reader who is not familiar with the subject. Chapter 2\ndeals with the LS-sequences of points. In Chapter 3, the method used to\nconstruct the transformation T is the so-called cutting-stacking technique. In\nparticular, we were able to prove the ergodicity of T and that the orbit of the\norigin under this map coincides with an LS-sequence which turns out to be a\nlow-discrepancy one. In Chapter 4, another approach from ergodic theory is\nused. This approach is based on the study of dynamical systems arising from\nnumeration systems defined by linear recurrences. In this way we could not only\nprove that the transformation T defined in Chapter 3 is uniquely ergodic, but\nwe could also construct multidimensional uniformly distributed sequences. In\nChapter 5 we found bounds for integrals of two-dimensional, piecewise constant\nfunctions with respect to copulas. To solve this problem, we drew a connection\nto linear assignment problems.

However, while neurophysiologists have long been able to record\nthe responses of neurons in awake, behaving animals, it is another matter\nentirely to say what a given neuron does. A key problem is that in many sensory\ndomains, the space of all possible stimuli that one might encounter is\neffectively infinite; in vision, for instance, natural scenes are\ncombinatorially complex, and an organism will only encounter a tiny fraction of\npossible stimuli. As a result, even describing the response properties of\nsensory neurons is difficult, and investigations of neuronal functions are\nalmost always critically limited by the number of stimuli that can be\nconsidered. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop, optimization-based\nexperimental framework for characterizing the response properties of sensory\nneurons, building on past efforts in closed-loop experimental methods, and\nleveraging recent advances in artificial neural networks to serve as as a\nproving ground for our techniques. Specifically, using deep convolutional\nneural networks, we asked whether modern black-box optimization techniques can\nbe used to interrogate the \"tuning landscape\" of an artificial neuron in a\ndeep, nonlinear system, without imposing significant constraints on the space\nof stimuli under consideration. We introduce a series of measures to quantify\nthe tuning landscapes, and show how these relate to the performances of the\nnetworks in an object recognition task.

The latter indicates a\ndependence measure of extremes and also reflects the cluster structure of the\nnetwork. The clustering is caused by dependence between nodes and heavy-tailed\ndistributions of their degrees. Based on extreme value theory we estimate the\nmean and the distribution of the first hitting time and the distribution of\nnode degrees by real data from social networks. We demonstrate the heaviness of\nthe tails of these data using appropriate tools. The same methodology can be\napplied to other complex networks like peer-to-peer telecommunication systems.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, conference IFAC INCOM-2015, Ottawa, Canada"]}]

Taking the standpoint that the Chelyabinsk impactor indeed\nseparated from 1999 NC43 by a cratering or rotational fission event, we run a\nforward probability calculation, which is an independent statistical test.\nHowever, we find this scenario is unlikely at the about (10-3 -10-2) level.

While, a mechanism of\nthe non-principal axis rotation excitation is unclear, we can rule out the\nformation of asteroid in disruption of its parent body as a plausible cause, as\nit is unlikely that the rotation of an asteroid fragment from catastrophic\ndisruption would be nearly completely halted.
