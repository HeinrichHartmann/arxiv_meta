Specializing FW to SVM training has\nallowed to obtain efficient algorithms but also important theoretical results,\nincluding convergence analysis of training algorithms and new characterizations\nof model sparsity.\n  In this paper, we present and analyze a novel variant of the FW method based\non a new way to perform away steps, a classic strategy used to accelerate the\nconvergence of the basic FW procedure. Our formulation and analysis is focused\non a general concave maximization problem on the simplex. However, the\nspecialization of our algorithm to quadratic forms is strongly related to some\nclassic methods in computational geometry, namely the Gilbert and MDM\nalgorithms.\n  On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that the method matches the\nguarantees in terms of convergence rate and number of iterations obtained by\nusing classic away steps. In particular, the method enjoys a linear rate of\nconvergence, a result that has been recently proved for MDM on quadratic forms.\n  On the practical side, we provide experiments on several classification\ndatasets, and evaluate the results using statistical tests. Experiments show\nthat our method is faster than the FW method with classic away steps, and works\nwell even in the cases in which classic away steps slow down the algorithm.\nFurthermore, these improvements are obtained without sacrificing the predictive\naccuracy of the obtained SVM model.\n","Comment: REVISED VERSION (October 2013) -- Title and abstract have been\n  revised.

While a wide\nrange of tools and techniques for time series analysis already exist, the\nincreasing availability of massive data structures calls for new approaches for\nmultidimensional signal processing. We present here a non-parametric method to\nanalyse multivariate time series, based on the mapping of a multidimensional\ntime series into a multilayer network, which allows to extract information on a\nhigh dimensional dynamical system through the analysis of the structure of the\nassociated multiplex network. The method is simple to implement, general,\nscalable, does not require ad hoc phase space partitioning, and is thus\nsuitable for the analysis of large, heterogeneous and non-stationary time\nseries. We show that simple structural descriptors of the associated multiplex\nnetworks allow to extract and quantify nontrivial properties of coupled chaotic\nmaps, including the transition between different dynamical phases and the onset\nof various types of synchronization. As a concrete example we then study\nfinancial time series, showing that a multiplex network analysis can\nefficiently discriminate crises from periods of financial stability, where\nstandard methods based on time-series symbolization often fail.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures.

We empirically demonstrate that in the\ndeep learning setting, due to the existence of many local optima, allowing more\nexploration can lead to the improved performance. We propose synchronous and\nasynchronous variants of the new algorithm. We provide the stability analysis\nof the asynchronous variant in the round-robin scheme and compare it with the\nmore common parallelized method ADMM. We show that the stability of EASGD is\nguaranteed when a simple stability condition is satisfied, which is not the\ncase for ADMM. We additionally propose the momentum-based version of our\nalgorithm that can be applied in both synchronous and asynchronous settings.\nAsynchronous variant of the algorithm is applied to train convolutional neural\nnetworks for image classification on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.\nExperiments demonstrate that the new algorithm accelerates the training of deep\narchitectures compared to DOWNPOUR and other common baseline approaches and\nfurthermore is very communication efficient.\n","Comment: NIPS2015 camera-ready version"]}]

Analytical studies of localization\nperformance (e.g., using the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound) usually require that\none fix the BS geometry, and favorable geometries have always been the\npreferred choice in the literature. However, not only are the resulting\nanalytical results constrained to the selected geometry, this practice is\nlikely to lead to overly-optimistic expectations of typical localization\nperformance. Ideally, localization performance should be studied across all\npossible geometric setups, thereby also removing any selection bias. This,\nhowever, is known to be hard and has been carried out only in simulation. In\nthis paper, we develop a new tractable approach where we endow the BS locations\nwith a distribution by modeling them as a Poisson point process (PPP), and use\ntools from stochastic geometry to obtain easy-to-use expressions for key\nperformance metrics. In particular, we focus on the probability of detecting\nsome minimum number of BSs, which is shown to be closely coupled with a network\noperator's ability to obtain satisfactory localization performance (e.g., meet\nFCC E911 requirements). This metric is indifferent to the localization\ntechnique (e.g., TOA, TDOA, AOA, or hybrids thereof), though different\ntechniques will presumably lead to different BS hearability requirements.

The strengths of\n2PI approximations are often described in terms of a selective resummation of\nFeynman diagrams to infinite order. However, the Feynman diagram series is\nasymptotic and summation is at best a dangerous procedure. Here we show that,\nat least in the context of a toy model where exact results are available, the\ntrue strength of 2PI approximations derives from their self-consistency rather\nthan any resummation. This self-consistency allows truncated 2PI approximations\nto capture the branch points of physical amplitudes where adjustments of\ncoupling constants can trigger an instability of the vacuum. This, in effect,\nturns Dyson's argument for the failure of perturbation theory on its head. As a\nresult we find that 2PI approximations perform better than Pad\\'e approximation\nand are competitive with Borel-Pad\\'e resummation. Finally, we introduce a\nhybrid 2PI-Pad\\'e method.\n","Comment: Version accepted for publication in Nuclear Physics B. 31 pages, 16\n  figures. Uses feynmf"]}]

Recently, the measure basin stability was introduced\nto quantify a node's ability to recover its synchronization when perturbed. In\nthis work, we focus on how basin stability depends on the coupling strength\nbetween nodes. We use the Chilean power grid as a case study. In general, basin\nstability goes from zero to one as coupling strength increases. However, this\ntransition does not happen at the same value for different nodes. By\nunderstanding the transition for individual nodes, we can further characterize\ntheir role in the power-transmission dynamics.

Thus, ESO533-4 contains little or no retrograde\nmaterial. This is compatible with three formation scenarii: the secular heating\nof an initially thin disc, the formation of the thick disc at high redshift in\na turbulent disc phase, and its creation in a major merger event.

We argue that a derivative liability, after primary risk factors\nbeing hedged, resembles in economics an issued variable funding note, and\nshould be priced at the market rate of the issuer's debt. For the purpose of\ndetermining the fair value, the party on the liability side is economically\nneutral to make a deposit to the other party, which earns his current debt rate\nand effectively provides funding and hedging for the party holding the\nderivative asset. The newly derived partial differential equation for an option\ndiscounts the derivative's receivable part with counterparty's curve and\npayable part with own financing curve. The price difference from the\ncounterparty risk free price, or total counterparty risk adjustment, is\nprecisely defined by discounting the product of the risk free price and the\ncredit spread at the local liability curve. Subsequently the adjustment can be\nbroken into a default risk component -- CVA and a funding component -- FVA,\nconsistent with a simple note's fair value treatment and in accordance with the\nusual understanding of a bond's credit spread consisting of a CDS spread and a\nbasis. As for FVA, we define a cost -- credit funding adjustment (CFA) and a\nbenefit -- debit funding adjustment (DFA), in parallel to CVA and DVA and\nattributed to counterparty's and own funding basis. This resolves a number of\noutstanding FVA debate issues, such as double counting, violation of the law of\none price, misuse of cash flow discounting, and controversial hedging of own\ndefault risk.

We analyze a three species model, where a generalist top predator is\nintroduced into an ecosystem as a biological control, to check the population\nof a middle predator, that in turn is depredating on a prey species. We show\nthat the inclusion of predator interference alone, can cause the solution of\nthe top predator equation to blow-up in finite time, while there is global\nexistence in the no interference case. This result shows that interference\ncould actually cause a population explosion of the top predator, enabling it to\ncontrol the target species, thus corroborating recent field evidence.

Thus, a RNAP can be regarded as a molecular motor for which the\nssDNA template serves as the track. The sites of start and stop of its walk on\nthe DNA mark the two ends of the genetic message that it transcribes into RNA.\nInterference of transcription of two overlapping genes can strongly influence\nthe levels of their expression, i.e., the overall rate of the synthesis of the\ncorresponding full-length RNA molecules, through suppressive effect of one on\nthe other. Here we model this process as a mixed traffic of two groups of RNAP\nmotors that are characterized by two distinct pairs of on- and off-ramps. Each\ngroup polymerizes identical copies of a RNA while the RNAs polymerized by the\ntwo groups are different. These models, which may also be viewed as two\ninterfering totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes, account for all\nmodes of transcriptional interference in spite of their extreme simplicity. We\nstudy both co-directional and contra-directional traffic of the two groups of\nRNAP motors. Two special cases of the general model correspond to traffic of\nbacteriophage RNAP motors and that of non-phage RNAP motors. By a combination\nof mean-field theory and computer simulation of these models we establish the\nconditions under which increasing rate of initiation of transcription of one\ngene can switch off another. However, the mechanisms of switching observed in\nthe traffic of phage-RNAP and non-phage RNAP motors are different. Some of our\nnew predictions can be tested experimentally by correlating the rate of RNA\nsynthesis with the RNAP footprints on the respective DNA templates.\n","Comment: 14 pages; This paper supersedes the shorter version arXiv:1502.07709;\n  the model developed here is more general than that reported in\n  arXiv:1502.07709"]}]

To improve throughput and to\nreduce decoding latency of polar decoders, maximum likelihood (ML) decoding\nunits are used by successive cancellation list (SCL) decoders as well as\nsuccessive cancellation (SC) decoders. This paper proposes an approximate ML\n(AML) decoding unit for SCL decoders first.

However, if error performance is of higher\npriority, the multi-mode decoder switches to a serial mode with a bigger list\nsize. Therefore, the multi-mode SCL decoder provides a flexible tradeoff\nbetween latency, throughput and error performance, and adapts to different\nthroughput and latency requirements at the expense of small overhead.

Given the typical methods used to prepare SmB6 single\ncrystals, the flux and floating zone procedures, these ascriptions should not\nbe taken lightly.
