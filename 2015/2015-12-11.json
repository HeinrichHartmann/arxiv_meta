In theory, auction mechanisms have many desirable\neconomic properties.

However, large $n$ player interactions are more realistically\nmodeled as games of incomplete information, where players may know little to\nnothing about the types of other players. Unfortunately, games in incomplete\ninformation settings lose many of the nice properties of complete information\ngames: the quality of equilibria can become worse, the equilibria lose their\nex-post properties, and coordinating on an equilibrium becomes even more\ndifficult. Because of these problems, we would like to study games of\nincomplete information, but still implement equilibria of the complete\ninformation game induced by the (unknown) realized player types.\n  This problem was recently studied by Kearns et al. and solved in large games\nby means of introducing a weak mediator: their mediator took as input reported\ntypes of players, and output suggested actions which formed a correlated\nequilibrium of the underlying game. Players had the option to play\nindependently of the mediator, or ignore its suggestions, but crucially, if\nthey decided to opt-in to the mediator, they did not have the power to lie\nabout their type. In this paper, we rectify this deficiency in the setting of\nlarge congestion games. We give, in a sense, the weakest possible mediator: it\ncannot enforce participation, verify types, or enforce its suggestions.\nMoreover, our mediator implements a Nash equilibrium of the complete\ninformation game. We show that it is an (asymptotic) ex-post equilibrium of the\nincomplete information game for all players to use the mediator honestly, and\nthat when they do so, they end up playing an approximate Nash equilibrium of\nthe induced complete information game. In particular, truthful use of the\nmediator is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium in any Bayesian game for any prior.\n","Comment: The conference version of this paper appeared in EC 2014.

The former has achieved a significant automation via real-time\nbidding (RTB); however, the latter is still mainly done over the counter\nthrough direct sales. This paper proposes a mathematical model that allocates\nand prices the future impressions between real-time auctions and guaranteed\ncontracts.

However, its spin version is rarely addressed, mainly due to\nthe fact that a macroscopic boundary in quantum spin systems is hard to define.\nIn this article, we explore the spin Casimir effect induced by the zero-point\nfluctuation of spin waves in a general non-collinear ordered quantum\nantiferromagnet. This spin Casimir effect results in a spin torque between\nlocal spins and further causes various singular and divergent results in the\nframework of spin-wave theory, which invalidate the standard $1/S$ expansion\nprocedure. To avoid this dilemma, we develop a self-consistent spin-wave\nexpansion approach, which preserves the spin-wave expansion away from\nsingularities and divergence.

One may\ntry to suppress the bath effects by means of dynamical control, but such\ncontrol does not always yield the desired results. We wish instead to take\nadvantage of bath effects, that do not obliterate \"quantumness\" in the\nsystem-bath compound. To this end, three possible approaches have been pursued\nby us: (i) Control of a quantum system faster than the correlation time of the\nbath to which it couples: Such control allows us to reveal\nquasi-reversible/coherent dynamical phenomena of quantum open systems, manifest\nby the quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effects (QZE or AZE, respectively). Dynamical\ncontrol methods based on the QZE are aimed not only at protecting the\nquantumness of the system, but also diagnosing the bath spectra or transferring\nquantum information via noisy media. By contrast, AZE-based control is useful\nfor fast cooling of thermalized quantum systems. (ii) Engineering the coupling\nof quantum systems to selected bath modes: This approach, based on field -atom\ncoupling control in cavities, waveguides and photonic band structures, allows\nto drastically enhance the strength and range of atom-atom coupling through the\nmediation of the selected bath modes. More dramatically, it allows us to\nachieve bath-induced entanglement that may appear paradoxical if one takes the\nconventional view that coupling to baths destroys quantumness. (iii)\nEngineering baths with appropriate non-flat spectra: This approach is a\nprerequisite for the construction of the simplest and most efficient quantum\nheat machines (engines and refrigerators). We may thus conclude that often\nthermal baths are \"more friends than foes\" in quantum technologies.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 17 figures"]}]

Contrary to the time-homogeneous case,\ntime-inhomogeneous affine processes are in general neither regular nor\nsemimartingales and the time-inhomogeneous case raises many new and interesting\nquestions. Assuming that an affine process is a semimartingale, we show that\neven without regularity the parameter functions satisfy generalized Riccati\nintegral equations. This generalizes an important result for time-homogeneous\naffine processes. We also show that stochastically continuous affine\nsemimartingales are essentially generated by deterministic time-changes of what\nwe call absolutely continuously affine semimartingales. These processes\ngeneralize time-homogeneous regular affine processes.\n  In the second part we consider the class of affine LIBOR market models. We\ncontribute to this class of models in two ways. First, we modify the original\nsetup of the affine LIBOR market models in such a way that next to nonnegative\naffine processes real-valued affine processes can also be used. Numerical\nexamples show that this allows for more flexible implied volatility surfaces.\nSecond, we introduce the class of affine inflation market models, an extension\nof the affine LIBOR market models.

The method is based on the comparison of two different models and allows\nthe discarding of those variables with no group information and those variables\ncarrying the same information as the already selected ones. We consider a\nswap-stepwise algorithm where at each step the models are compared through and\napproximation to their Bayes factor. The method is applied to the selection of\nthe clinical criteria most useful for the clustering of patients in different\nclasses of pain. It is shown to perform a parsimonious variable selection and\nto give a good clustering performance. The quality of the approach is also\nassessed on simulated data.\n"]}]

Distance measures have been used as natural\nmeasures of (dis)similarity and served as the foundation of various learning\nmethods. The efficiency of distance-based learning methods heavily depends on\nthe chosen distance metric. With increasing dimensionality and complexity of\ndata, however, traditional metric learning methods suffer from poor scalability\nand the limitation due to linearity as the true signals are usually embedded\nwithin a low-dimensional nonlinear subspace. In this paper, we propose a\nnonlinear sparse metric learning algorithm via boosting. We restructure a\nglobal optimization problem into a forward stage-wise learning of weak learners\nbased on a rank-one decomposition of the weight matrix in the Mahalanobis\ndistance metric. A gradient boosting algorithm is devised to obtain a sparse\nrank-one update of the weight matrix at each step. Nonlinear features are\nlearned by a hierarchical expansion of interactions incorporated within the\nboosting algorithm. Meanwhile, an early stopping rule is imposed to control the\noverall complexity of the learned metric. As a result, our approach guarantees\nthree desirable properties of the final metric: positive semi-definiteness, low\nrank and element-wise sparsity.

We also present a\nsubclass for two dimensional cycles (i.e. circles, parabolas and hyperbolas),\nwhich add some 2D specific routines including a visualisation to PostScript\nfiles through the MetaPost (http://www.tug.org/metapost.html) or Asymptote\n(http://asymptote.sourceforge.net/) packages.\n  This software is the backbone of many results published in math.CV/0512416\nand we use its applications their for demonstration. The library can be ported\n(with various level of required changes) to other CAS with Clifford algebras\ncapabilities similar to GiNaC.\n  There is an ISO image of a Live Debian DVD attached to this paper as an\nauxiliary file, a copy is stored on Google Drive as well.\n","Comment: LaTeX, 82 p; 11 PS graphics in two figures, the full source files and\n  ISO image of Live DVD are included; v9: library update for the book on\n  Moebius transformations; v10: an ISO image of a Live DVD is attached to the\n  paper; v11: a bug is fixed; v12: Library is uupdated, the reference to a\n  larger project is added"]}]
