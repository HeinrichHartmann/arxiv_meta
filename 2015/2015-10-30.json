The discovery of this fact was\nunexpected and resulted in the comeback of cosmological constant. The\nconception of standard cosmological model has its roots in this context. The\npaper relates to the methodological status of effective theories in the context\nof cosmological investigations. We argue that the standard cosmological model\n(LCDM model) as well as the CDM have a status of effective theories only,\nsimilarly to the standard model of particle physics. The LCDM model is studied\nfrom the point of view of the methodological debate on reductionism and\nepistemological emergence in the science. It is shown in the paper that\nbifurcation as well as structural instability notion can be useful in the\ndetection of emergence the LCDM model from the CDM model. We demonstrate that\nthe structural stability of the LCDM model can explain the flexibility of the\nmodel to accommodation of the observational data. We show that LCDM model can\nbe derived from CDM as the bifurcation. It is an example of acausal derivation\nof Lambda term. The case study of emergence of LCDM model suggests that it can\nbe understood in terms of bifurcation and structural stability issue. The\nreduction from the upper models represented in terms of dynamical system to\nlow-level ones can be realized in any case by application of a mathematical\nlimit (boundary crossing) with respect to the model parameter. It is a simple\nconsequence of mathematical theorem about smooth dependence solutions with\nrespect to time, initial condition and the parameters.\n","Comment: 8ssmmp.cls, 14 pages, 3 figures; rev. 2: added section on emergence\n  from bifurcation; rev. 3: reorganized and shortened text; transition from the\n  LCDM to CDM model was explicitly shown, for this aim it was used the theorem\n  on smooth dependence of solution on initial conditions and change of\n  parameters.

Perhaps surprisingly, such\napproximations lead to powerful algorithms which are exact in the sense that\nthey are guaranteed to have correct limiting distributions.

The convex order\nplays a central role by allowing us to construct a martingale coupling which\nenables the comparison of performance measures of Markov chain with differing\ninvariant distributions, contrary to existing results.

However technological applications are currently limited by\nthe low mobility of the charge carriers associated with the disorder in these\nmaterials [5-8]. Much effort over the past decades has therefore been focused\non optimizing the organisation of the material or the devices to improve\ncarrier mobility. Here we take a radically different path to solving this\nproblem, namely by injecting carriers into states that are hybridized to the\nvacuum electromagnetic field. These are coherent states that can extend over as\nmany as 10^5 molecules and should thereby favour conductivity in such\nmaterials. To test this idea, organic semiconductors were strongly coupled to\nthe vacuum electromagnetic field on plasmonic structures to form polaritonic\nstates with large Rabi splittings ca. 0.7 eV. Conductivity experiments show\nthat indeed the current does increase by an order of magnitude at resonance in\nthe coupled state, reflecting mostly a change in field-effect mobility as\nrevealed when the structure is gated in a transistor configuration. A\ntheoretical quantum model is presented that confirms the delocalization of the\nwave-functions of the hybridized states and the consequences on the\nconductivity. While this is a proof-of-principle study, in practice\nconductivity mediated by light-matter hybridized states is easy to implement\nand we therefore expect that it will be used to improve organic devices.

We propose a\nsymbolic framework for capturing symmetry patterns in parameterised systems\n(i.e. an infinite family of finite-state systems): two regular word transducers\nto represent, respectively, parameterised systems and symmetry patterns. The\nframework subsumes various types of symmetry relations ranging from weaker\nnotions (e.g. simulation preorders) to the strongest notion (i.e.\nisomorphisms). Our framework enjoys two algorithmic properties: (1) symmetry\nverification: given a transducer, we can automatically check whether it is a\nsymmetry pattern of a given system, and (2) symmetry synthesis: we can\nautomatically generate a symmetry pattern for a given system in the form of a\ntransducer. Furthermore, our symbolic language allows additional constraints\nthat the symmetry patterns need to satisfy to be easily incorporated in the\nverification/synthesis. We show how these properties can help identify symmetry\npatterns in examples like dining philosopher protocols, self-stabilising\nprotocols, and prioritised resource-allocator protocol.

Using the FLASH code, we solved the 3D ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic equations. Our model consists of a straight, density\nenhanced and gravitationally stratified magnetic flux tube. We perturbed the\nsystem initially, leading to a transverse oscillation of the structure, and\nfollowed its evolution for a number of periods. A realistic radiative cooling\nis implemented. Results are compared to available analytical theory. We find\nthat in the linear regime (i.e. low amplitude perturbation and slow cooling)\nthe obtained period and damping time are in good agreement with theory. The\ncooling leads to an amplification of the oscillation amplitude. However, the\ndifference between the cooling and non-cooling cases is small (around 6% after\n6 oscillations). In high amplitude runs with realistic cooling, instabilities\ndeform the loop, leading to increased damping. In this case, the difference\nbetween cooling and non-cooling is still negligible at around 12%. A set of\nsimulations with higher density loops are also performed, to explore what\nhappens when the cooling takes place in a very short time (tcool = 100 s). We\nstrengthen the results of previous analytical studies that state that the\namplification due to cooling is ineffective, and its influence on the\noscillation characteristics is small, at least for the cases shown here.\nFurthermore, the presence of a relatively strong damping in the high amplitude\nruns even in the fast cooling case indicates that it is unlikely that cooling\ncould alone account for the observed, flare-related undamped oscillations of\ncoronal loops.

However, unlike their crystalline\ncounterparts, disordered solids are not well understood. One of the primary\nobstacles is the lack of a theoretical framework for thinking about disorder\nand its relation to mechanical properties. To this end, we study an idealized\nsystem of frictionless athermal soft spheres that, when compressed, undergoes a\njamming phase transition with diverging length scales and clean power-law\nsignatures. This critical point is the cornerstone of a much larger \"jamming\nscenario\" that has the potential to provide the essential theoretical\nfoundation necessary for a unified understanding of the mechanics of disordered\nsolids. We begin by showing that jammed sphere packings have a valid linear\nregime despite the presence of \"contact nonlinearities.\" We then investigate\nthe critical nature of the transition, focusing on diverging length scales and\nfinite-size effects. Next, we argue that jamming plays the same role for\ndisordered solids as the perfect crystal plays for crystalline solids. Not only\ncan it be considered an idealized starting point for understanding disordered\nmaterials, but it can even influence systems that have a relatively high amount\nof crystalline order. The behavior of solids can thus be thought of as existing\non a spectrum, with the perfect crystal and the jamming transition at opposing\nends. Finally, we introduce a new principle wherein the contribution of an\nindividual bond to one global property is independent of its contribution to\nanother. This principle allows the different global responses of a disordered\nsystem to be manipulated independently and provides a great deal of flexibility\nin designing materials with unique, textured and tunable properties.\n","Comment: 242 pages, 37 figures, Ph.D. thesis"]}]
