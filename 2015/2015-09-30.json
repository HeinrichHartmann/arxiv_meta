The X-ray image shows no compact source that could be associated\nwith an AGN. Instead, the emission is extended -- likely due to nuclear star\nformation and the total measured X-ray luminosity is comparable to the X-ray\nluminosity determined from the 2002 Chandra observations. Diffuse X-ray\nemission was detected close to the circum-nuclear star forming ring. The\nSpitzer 2006 mid-infrared spectrum also shows strong evidence of nuclear star\nformation but no clear AGN signatures. The semi-analytical models of Tommasin\net. al. 2010 together with the measured [OIV]/[NeII] line ratio suggest that at\nmost only 5.6% of the total IR Flux at 19 $\\mu$m is being contributed by the\nAGN. The GMRT 1.28 GHz observations reveal a nuclear source. In the much higher\nresolution VLA 3 GHz map, the emission has a double lobed structure of size\n2.7'' due to the circumnuclear star forming ring. The GMRT 1.28 GHz peak\nemission coincides with the center of the circumnuclear ring. We did not detect\nany emission in the VLA 8 GHz (1996) archival data. The 3 $\\sigma$ upper limits\nfor the radio afterglow of the TDE at 1.28 GHz, 3 GHz and 8 GHz are 0.17 mJy,\n0.09 mJy and 0.09 mJy, respectively. Our studies thus show that (i) NGC 5905\nhas a declining X-ray flux consistent with a TDE, (ii) the IR flux is dominated\nby nuclear star formation, (iii) the nuclear radio emission observed from the\ngalaxy is due to circumnuclear star formation, (iv) no compact radio emission\nassociated with a radio afterglow from the TDE is detected.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, accepted to be published in Astrophysics and\n  Space Science"]}]

The result of comparison concludes\nthat teleporting information through channel that is based on the GHZ state is\nmore robust than teleporting information through channels that are based on the\nother two states.

The corrected extinction provides the best fit to the total\ngas traced by the gamma rays, but we find evidence for a rise in $A_{VQ}/N_H$\nand a steep rise in opacity, with increasing $N_H$ and $H_2$ fraction, and with\ndecreasing dust temperature.

The gamma rays and dust radiance yield\nconsistent $X_{CO}$ estimates near $0.7\\times10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K\nkm/s)$^{-1}$.

Interestingly, this scattering also presents little or no\n$L$-dependence. As the phonons and dispersive spin excitations centered at\nequivalent ($\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}, L$) wave-vectors are common to all\nmembers of La-based 214 copper oxides, we conclude such strong quasi-two\ndimensional scattering enhancements are likely to occur in all such 214\nfamilies of materials, including those concentrations corresponding to\nsuperconducting ground states. Such a phenomenon appears to be a fundamental\ncharacteristic of these materials and is potentially related to superconducting\npairing.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 9 figures in main manuscript, 4 pages, 5 figures in\n  supplemental materials"]}]

For this purpose we compute the vertical cohomology\n$H_V^{(2,2)}(X)$ in each case and solve the conditions imposed by matching the\nM- and F-theoretical 3D Chern-Simons terms. We explicitly check that the\nexpressions found for the $G_4$-flux allow for a cancelation of D3-brane\ntadpoles. We also use the integrality of 3D Chern-Simons terms to ensure that\nour $G_4$-flux solutions are adequately quantized.\n","Comment: 45 pages, 6 figures, 13 tables"]}]

We\ndemonstrate that this approach well approximates results obtained from Monte\nCarlo simulation and that its accuracy is often superior to the pair\napproximation (which also takes second-order correlations into account).\nMoreover, our approach is more computationally efficient than the pair\napproximation, especially for complex epidemic models: the number of variables\nin our DMP approach grows as $2mk$ where $m$ is the number of edges and $k$ is\nthe number of states, as opposed to $mk^2$ for the pair approximation.

The flow continues as it\nrolls up into a pair of up-down symmetric horizontal vortex lines shed into the\nwake of the planet. This flow, unique to 3D, affects both planet accretion and\nmigration. It prevents the planet from sustaining a hydrostatic atmosphere due\nto its intrusion into the Bondi sphere, and leads to a significant corotation\ntorque on the planet, unanticipated by 2D analysis.

This contrasts with a recent analysis of H(z)\ndata based solely on BAO measurements which, however, strongly depend on the\nassumed cosmology. We discuss why the latter approach is inappropriate for\nmodel comparisons, and emphasize again the need for truly model-independent\nobservations to be used in cosmological tests.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 1 figure, 1 table.

To demonstrate this, we model the launch and arrival of a microwave\nbeam-driven light sail constructed for transit between planets in orbit around\na single star, and find an optimal beam frequency on the order of tens of GHz.\nLeakage from these beams yields transients with flux densities of Jy and\ndurations of tens of seconds at 100 pc.

In\nparticular, we investigate 27 Kepler systems having planets within 6% of the\n2:1 MMR, and find that the initial eccentricities required to explain the\nobserved spacings are unreasonable from simple dynamical arguments.\nFurthermore, our numerical simulations reveal resonant tugging, an effect which\nconspires against the migration of resonant planets away from the 2:1 MMR,\nrequiring even higher initial eccentricities in order to explain the current\nKepler distribution. Overall, we find that tides alone cannot explain planets\nclose to 2:1 MMR, and additional mechanisms are required to explain these\nsystems.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS, 9 pages, 5 figures, 1 table"]}]

The brightness of the [NII] and Halpha lines as a\nfunction of distance from W26 agrees reasonably well with observations when\nonly the line flux is considered.

In substring\nsearching, the task is to find the occurrences of a deterministic string in an\nuncertain string. We formulate the string listing problem for uncertain\nstrings, where the objective is to output all the strings from a collection of\nstrings, that contain probable occurrence of a deterministic query string.\nIndexing solution for both these problems are significantly more challenging\nfor uncertain strings than for deterministic strings.

The framework allows natural\ndefinitions of semantics (as the meaning encoded in functions), representations\n(as functions whose semantics is chosen to optimized a criterion) and grammars\n(as communication protocols equipped with first-order convergence guarantees).\n  Much of the essay is spent discussing examples taken from the literature. The\nultimate aim is to develop a graphical language for describing the structure of\ndeep learning algorithms that backgrounds the details of the optimization\nprocedure and foregrounds how the components interact. Inspiration is taken\nfrom probabilistic graphical models and factor graphs, which capture the\nessential structural features of multivariate distributions.\n","Comment: 20 pages, many diagrams"]}]

While Trickle's broadcast suppression mechanism has been proven to\nbe efficient, recent work has shown that it is intrinsically unfair in terms of\nload distribution and that its performance relies strongly on network topology.\nThis can lead to increased end-to-end delays (MPL), or creation of sub-optimal\nroutes (RPL). Furthermore, as highlighted in this work, there is no clear\nconsensus within the research community about what the proper parameter\nsettings of the suppression mechanism should be. We propose an extension to the\nTrickle algorithm, called adaptive-k, which allows nodes to individually adapt\ntheir suppression mechanism to local node density. Supported by analysis and a\ncase study with RPL, we show that this extension allows for an easier\nconfiguration of Trickle, making it more robust to network topology.\n"]}]

We develop our approach by focusing on the problem\nof intrinsically-motivated learning, where the mutual information forms the\ndefinition of a well-known internal drive known as empowerment. Using a\nvariational lower bound on the mutual information, combined with convolutional\nnetworks for handling visual input streams, we develop a stochastic\noptimisation algorithm that allows for scalable information maximisation and\nempowerment-based reasoning directly from pixels to actions.\n","Comment: Proceedings of the 29th Conference on Neural Information Processing\n  Systems (NIPS 2015)"]}]

Our\nsecond argument is based on exact analyses of special cases of protective\nmeasurement, and our final argument is to construct explicit \"$\\psi$-epistemic\"\ntoy models for protective measurement, which strongly suggest that protective\nmeasurement does not imply the reality of the quantum state. The common theme\nof the three arguments is that almost all of the information comes from the\n\"protection\" operation rather than the quantum state of the system, and hence\nthe schemes have no implications for the reality of the quantum state.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The number of model parameters and test time evaluation complexity of\nthe proposed method are O(dD) where D is the dimensionality of the input\nfeatures and d is the dimension of the projection space - this is in contrast\nto the usual kernelization methods as, unlike them, the complexity does not\nscale linearly with the number of training examples.
