Here Hindustani Music has been\nused as a reference frame for tracking the changing perception of emotions. It\nhas been found that different emotions perceived from Hindustani Music form a\nparticular sequential pattern when their corresponding pitch periods are\nanalyzed using the standard deviations and mean successive squared\ndifferences.This sequential pattern of emotions coincides with their\ncorresponding sequential pattern of tempos or average number of steady states.\nOn the basis of this result we further found that the range of perception of\nemotions has diminished significantly these days compared to what it was\nbefore. The proportion of responses for the perceived emotions like Anger,\nSerenity, Romantic and Sorrow has also decreased to a great extent than what it\nwas previously. The proportion of responses for the perceived emotion Anxiety\nhas increased phenomenally. Both standard deviation and mean successive squared\ndifference are two very good measures in tracking the changing perception of\nemotions. The overall pattern of the change of perceived emotions has\ncorresponded to the psychological and sociological change of human life.\n","Comment: Conference: Proceedings of 7th International Conference of IMBIC on\n  \"Mathematical Sciences for Advancement of Science and Technology\" (MSAST\n  2013)"]}]

Incorporating the sCOLA method in\nan N-body code allows one to gain computational speed by capturing the\ngravitational potential from the far field using perturbative techniques, while\nletting the N-body code solve only for the near field. The far and near fields\nare completely decoupled, effectively localizing gravity for the N-body side of\nthe code.

We demonstrate that sCOLA can\nbe safely combined with the original temporal-domain COLA. sCOLA can be used as\na method for performing zoom-in simulations.

This observation has led to\nspeculation about what role, if any, microscopic disorder may play in enhancing\nexciton transport properties. In this article, we present the results of a\nmodel study aimed at addressing this point. Specifically, we present a general\nmodel, based upon F\\\"orster theory, for incoherent exciton diffusion in a\nmaterial composed of independent molecular subunits with static energetic\ndisorder. Energetic disorder leads to heterogeneity in molecule-to-molecule\ntransition rates which we demonstrate has two important consequences related to\nexciton transport. First, the distribution of local site-specific diffusivity\nis broadened in a manner that results in a decrease in average exciton\ndiffusivity relative to that in a perfectly ordered film. Second, since\nexcitons prefer to make transitions that are downhill in energy, the steady\nstate distribution of exciton energies is biased towards low energy molecular\nsubunits, those that exhibit reduced diffusivity relative to a perfectly\nordered film. These effects combine to reduce the net diffusivity in a manner\nthat is time dependent and grows more pronounced as disorder is increased.\nNotably, however, we demonstrate that the presence of energetic disorder can\ngive rise to a population of molecular subunits with exciton transfer rates\nexceeding that of subunits in an energetically uniform material.

To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of search and inference of mixture parameters using the proposed\napproach, we select two key probability distributions, each handling\nfundamentally different types of data: the multivariate Gaussian distribution\nto address mixture modelling of data distributed in Euclidean space, and the\nmultivariate von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to address mixture modelling\nof directional data distributed on a unit hypersphere. The key contributions of\nthis paper, in addition to the general search and inference methodology,\ninclude the derivation of MML expressions for encoding the data using\nmultivariate Gaussian and von Mises-Fisher distributions, and the analytical\nderivation of the MML estimates of the parameters of the two distributions. Our\napproach is tested on simulated and real world data sets. For instance, we\ninfer vMF mixtures that concisely explain experimentally determined\nthree-dimensional protein conformations, providing an effective null model\ndescription of protein structures that is central to many inference problems in\nstructural bioinformatics. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nperformance of our proposed search and inference method along with the encoding\nschemes improve on the state of the art mixture modelling techniques.\n","Comment: 46 pages"]}]
