Our methods also\nprove the $\\mathsf{K}_{1}(G)$ conjecture for rank two groups of the form\n$C_{n}\\oplus C_{q}$, where $q$ is the largest or second largest prime dividing\n$n$, and the prime factors of $n$ are far apart, and the $\\mathsf{k}(G)$\nconjecture for groups of the form $C_{n}\\oplus H_{q}$, where the prime factors\nof $n$ are far apart, $q$ is the largest prime factor of $n$, and $H_{q}$ is an\narbitrary finite abelian $q$-group.

The conditions necessary to produce LGRBs can affect the relation\nbetween the LGRB rate and star formation. By using the power of a complete LGRB\nsample, our aim is to understand whether such a bias exists and, if it does,\nwhat is its origin. In this first paper, we build the SED of the z<1 host\ngalaxies of the BAT6 LGRB sample, and determine their stellar masses from SED\nfitting. We compare the resulting stellar mass distribution (i) with\nstar-forming galaxies observed in deep surveys (UltraVISTA); (ii) with\nsemi-analitical models of the z<1 star forming galaxy population and (iii) with\nnumerical simulations of LGRB hosts having different metallicity thresholds for\nthe progenitor star environment. We find that at z<1 LGRBs tend to avoid\nmassive galaxies and are powerful in selecting faint low-mass star-forming\ngalaxies. The stellar mass distribution of the hosts is not consistent with\nthat of the UltraVISTA star-forming galaxies weighted for their SFR. This\nimplies that, at least at z<1, LGRBs are not unbiased tracers of star\nformation. To make the two distributions consistent, a much steeper faint-end\nof the mass function would be required, or a very shallow SFR-Mass relation for\nthe low mass galaxy population. GRB host galaxy simulations indicates that, to\nreproduce the stellar mass distribution, a metallicity threshold of the order\nof Z_th=0.3-0.5Z_sun is necessary. Models without a metallicity threshold or\nwith an extreme threshold of Z_th = 0.1Z_sun are excluded at z<1. The use of\nthe BAT6 complete sample makes this result not affected by possible biases\nwhich could have influenced past results based on incomplete samples. The\npreference for low metallicities (Z<~0.5Z_sun) can be a consequence of the\nparticular conditions needed for the progenitor star to produce a GRB.\n(Abridged)\n","Comment: 9 pages (+ Appendix: 5 pages), 7 figures, A&A in press"]}]

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, an {\\em incompatibility system}\n$\\mathcal{F}$ over $G$ is a family $\\mathcal{F}=\\{F_v\\}_{v\\in V}$ where for\nevery $v\\in V$, the set $F_v$ is a set of unordered pairs $F_v \\subseteq\n\\{\\{e,e'\\}: e\\ne e'\\in E, e\\cap e'=\\{v\\}\\}$. An incompatibility system is {\\em\n$\\Delta$-bounded} if for every vertex $v$ and an edge $e$ incident to $v$,\nthere are at most $\\Delta$ pairs in $F_v$ containing $e$.

In quantum gravity, in particular spin foams,\nmatter couplings have been defined in the past, yet the mutual dynamics, in\nparticular if matter and gravity are strongly coupled, are hardly explored,\nwhich is related to the definition of both matter and gravitational degrees of\nfreedom on the discretisation. However extracting this mutual dynamics is\ncrucial in testing the viability of the spin foam approach and also\nestablishing connections to other discrete approaches such as lattice gauge\ntheories.\n  Therefore, we introduce a simple 2D toy model for Yang--Mills coupled to spin\nfoams, namely an Ising model coupled to so--called intertwiner models defined\nfor $\\text{SU}(2)_k$. The two systems are coupled by choosing the Ising\ncoupling constant to depend on spin labels of the background, as these are\ninterpreted as the edge lengths of the discretisation. We coarse grain this toy\nmodel via tensor network renormalization and uncover an interesting dynamics:\nthe Ising phase transition temperature turns out to be sensitive to the\nbackground configurations and conversely, the Ising model can induce phase\ntransitions in the background. Moreover, we observe a strong coupling of both\nsystems if close to both phase transitions.\n","Comment: 31 + 6 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, v2: minor mistakes corrected,\n  references and acknowledgements updated.

We assume emission is given by the general triaxial non-aligned model of\nJones, whose waveform under certain conditions reduces to that of a biaxial\nprecessing star, or a simple rigidly rotating triaxial aligned star. The\ntriaxial non-aligned and biaxial models can produce emission at both the star's\nrotation frequency ($f$) and $2f$, whilst the latter only emits at $2f$. We\nhave studied parameter estimation for signal models using both a set of\nphysical source parameters, and a set of waveform parameters that remove a\ndegeneracy. We have assessed the signal detection efficiency, and used Bayesian\nmodel selection to investigate how well we can distinguish between the three\nmodels. We found that for signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) $\\gtrsim 6$ there is no\nsignificant loss in efficiency if performing a search for a signal at $f$ and\n$2f$ when the source is only producing emission at $2f$. However, for sources\nwith emission at both $f$ and $2f$ signals could be missed by a search only at\n$2f$. We also find that for a triaxial aligned source, the correct model is\nalways favoured, but for a triaxial non-aligned source it can be hard to\ndistinguish between the triaxial non-aligned model and the biaxial model, even\nat high SNR. Finally, we apply the method to a selection of known pulsars using\ndata from the LIGO fifth science run. We give the first upper limits on\ngravitational wave amplitude at both $f$ and $2f$ and apply the model selection\ncriteria on real data.\n","Comment: accepted for MNRAS"]}]

Instead,\nwe propose that the excess is caused by a deficit of the CRs at low rigidities\nin the regions of dense molecular clouds, which are characterized by higher\nenergy losses and stronger stellar winds. The 26Al line is a tracer of such\nregions. If we introduce a break in the cosmic ray injection spectra in the\nregions of strong 26Al production to effectively take the deficit of low\nrigidity CRs into account, the excess in the Galactic plane and towards the GC\nboth disappear.
