In particular, they can be used to discover and study a variety of\nbinary systems. A large number of binary lenses have already been found through\nmicrolensing surveys and a few of these systems show strong evidence of orbital\nmotion on the timescale of the lensing event. We expect that more binary lenses\nof this kind will be detected in the future. For binaries whose orbital period\nis comparable to the event duration, the orbital motion can cause the lensing\nsignal to deviate drastically from that of a static binary lens. The most\nstriking property of such light curves is the presence of quasi- periodic\nfeatures, which are produced as the source traverses the same regions in the\nrotating lens plane. These repeating features contain information about the\norbital period of the lens. If this period can be extracted, then much can be\nlearned about the lensing system even without performing time-consuming,\ndetailed light curve modeling. However, the relative transverse motion between\nthe source and the lens significantly complicates the problem of period\nextraction. To resolve this difficulty, we present a modification of the\nstandard Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis.

Solar supergranules exhibit a preferred sense of rotation, which\ndepends on the hemisphere. This is due to the Coriolis force acting on the\ndiverging horizontal flows. We aim to spatially resolve the vertical flow\nvorticity of the average supergranule at different latitudes, both for outflow\nand inflow regions. To measure the vertical vorticity, we use two independent\ntechniques: time-distance helioseismology (TD) and local correlation tracking\nof granules in intensity images (LCT) using data from the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Both maps\nare corrected for center-to-limb systematic errors. We find that 8-h TD and LCT\nmaps of vertical vorticity are highly correlated at large spatial scales.\nAssociated with the average supergranule outflow, we find tangential (vortical)\nflows that reach about 10 m/s in the clockwise direction at 40{\\deg} latitude.\nIn average inflow regions, the tangential flow reaches the same magnitude, but\nin the anti-clockwise direction. These tangential velocities are much smaller\nthan the radial (diverging) flow component (300 m/s for the average outflow and\n200 m/s for the average inflow). The results for TD and LCT as measured from\nHMI are in excellent agreement for latitudes between $-$60{\\deg} and 60{\\deg}.\nFrom HMI LCT, we measure the vorticity peak of the average supergranule to have\na full width at half maximum of about 13 Mm for outflows and 8 Mm for inflows.\nThis is larger than the spatial resolution of the LCT measurements (about 3\nMm). On the other hand, the vorticity peak in outflows is about half the value\nmeasured at inflows (e.g. 4/(10^6 s) clockwise compared to 8/(10^6 s)\nanti-clockwise at 40{\\deg} latitude).

As part of a world-wide campaign coordinated by\nthe International Halley Watch (IHW), narrowband photometry was obtained with\ntelescopes at 18 observatories. Following submissions to and basic reductions\nby the Photometry and Polarimetry Network of the IHW, we computed production\nrates and created composite lightcurves for each species. These were used to\nmeasure how the apparent rotational period (~7.35 day), along with its shape,\nevolved with time during the apparition. The lightcurve shape systematically\nvaried from double-peaked to triple-peaked and back again every 8-9 weeks, due\nto Halley's non-principal axis (complex) rotation and the associated component\nperiods. Unexpectedly, we found a phase shift of one-half cycle also took place\nduring this interval, and therefore the actual beat frequency between the\ncomponent periods is twice this interval or 16-18 weeks. Preliminary modeling\nsuggests that a single source might produce the entire post-perihelion\nlightcurve variability and associated evolution. The detailed evolution of the\napparent period varied in a non-smooth manner between 7.2 and 7.6 day, likely\ndue to a combination of synodic effects and the interaction of solar\nillumination with isolated source regions on a body in complex rotation. The\nneed to simultaneously reproduce each of these characteristics will provide\nvery strong additional constraints on Halley's component periods associated\nwith its complex rotation. To assist in these and future analyses, we created a\nsynthetic lightcurve based directly on the measured data. We unexpectedly\ndiscovered a strong correlation of ion tail disconnection event start times\nwith minima in the comet's gas production, implying that a decrease in\noutgassing is another cause of these events.\n","Comment: To be published in AJ; 19 pages text, 5 figures, and 4 tables"]}]

In this configuration the planetary orbit is aligned with the\ndisk in a state of apsidal corotation.To account for the closer orbit of\nKepler-34 b to the central binary, we considered a two-planet scenario and\nexamined the evolution of the system through joint inward migration and capture\ninto mean-motion resonances. When the inner planet orbits inside the gap of the\ndisk, planet-planet scattering ensues. While often one object is thrown into a\nlarge, highly eccentric orbit, at times the system is left with a planet close\nto the observed orbit, suggesting that Kepler 34 might have had two\ncircumbinary planets where one might have been scattered out of the system or\ninto an orbit where it did not transit the central binary during the operation\nof Kepler.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 13 figures, accepted by Astronomy & Astrophysics. arXiv\n  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1401.7648"]}]

As\npointed out here, however, the method does not automatically provide a\ncovariant quantization, defined as an anomaly-free quantum theory with a\nclassical limit in which the usual (off-shell) gauge structure of hypersurface\ndeformations in space-time appears. The holonomy-modified vacuum theory based\non Abelianization is covariant in this sense, but matter theories with local\ndegrees of freedom are not. Detailed demonstrations of these statements show\ncomplete agreement with results of canonical effective methods applied earlier\nto the same systems (including signature change).\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]

The bulk\nspeed of the clumps at their initial detection in the HI1-B images range from\n$200-400$ km s$^{-1}$ followed by an appreciable acceleration up to speeds of\n$450-600$ km s$^{-1}$, which are typical of slow to intermediate solar wind\nspeeds.

Despite these overall trends of\nincreased accretion rates in HAeBes when compared to classical T Tauri stars,\nwe also find noticeable differences in correlations when considering the Herbig\nAe and Herbig Be subsets. This, combined with the difficulty in applying a\nmagnetospheric accretion model to some of the Herbig Be stars, could suggest\nthat another form of accretion may be occurring within the Herbig Be mass\nrange.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 19 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

Several factors (local environment,\nhalo mass, merging mass ratio, and redshift) are found to influence the angular\nmomentum change. The spin distributions generated in the mean-field or void\nregions tend to shift slightly to a higher spin value compared with simulated\nspin distributions, which seems to be caused by the correlated random walks. We\nverified the assumption of randomness in the angular momentum change observed\nin the N-body simulation and detected several degrees of correlation between\nwalks, which may provide a clue for the discrepancies between the simulated and\ngenerated spin distributions in the voids. However, the generated spin\ndistributions in the group and cluster regions successfully match the simulated\nspin distribution. We also demonstrated that the log-normality of the spin\ndistribution is a natural consequence of the stochastic differential equation\nof the halo spin, which is well described by the Geometric Brownian Motion\nmodel.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 31 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJS"]}]

However,\nin practical cases it can be difficult to access the optical surfaces of\ndensely stacked mirror shells, after they have been assembled, using the\nwidespread metrological tools. For this reason, the assessment of the imaging\nresolution of a system of mirrors is better obtained via a direct,\nfull-illumination test in X-rays.

In this work, we study the effects of topological\nsurface states (TSSs) on the activity of transition metal clusters (Au, Ag, Cu,\nPt, and Pd), which are supported on a TI Bi2Se3 substrate. It was found the\nadsorption energy of oxygen on the supported catalysts can be always enhanced\ndue to the TSSs. However, it does not necessarily mean an increase of the\nactivity in catalytic oxidation reaction. Rather, the enhanced adsorption\nbehavior in the presence of TSSs exhibits dual effects, determined by the\nintrinsic reactivity of these catalysts with oxygen. For the Au case, the\nactivity of catalytic oxidation can be improved because the intrinsic binding\nbetween Au and O is relatively weak. In contrast, a negative effect is found\nfor the Pt and Pd clusters since the intrinsic binding of Pt and Pd with oxygen\nis too strong. We also found that the effect of TSSs on the activity of\nhydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is quite similar, i.e. the metals with\noriginal weak reactivity can gain a positive effect from TSSs.

Following the\nmicroplane model framework, the constitutive laws are formulated in terms of\nstress and strain vectors acting on planes of several orientations within the\nmaterial meso-structure. The model exploits the spectral decomposition of the\northotropic stiffness tensor to define orthogonal strain modes at the\nmicroplane level. These are associated to the various constituents at the\nmesoscale and to the material response to different types of deformation.\nStrain-dependent constitutive equations are used to relate the microplane\neigenstresses and eigenstrains while a variational principle is applied to\nrelate the microplane stresses at the mesoscale to the continuum tensor at the\nmacroscale. Thanks to these features, the resulting spectral stiffness\nmicroplane formulation can easily capture various physical inelastic phenomena\ntypical of fiber and textile composites such as: matrix microcracking,\nmicro-delamination, crack bridging, pullout, and debonding. The application of\nthe model to a twill 2$\\times$2 shows that it can realistically predict its\nuniaxial as well as multi-axial behavior. Furthermore, the model shows\nexcellent agreement with experiments on the axial crushing of composite tubes,\nthis capability making it a valuable design tool for crashworthiness\napplications.
