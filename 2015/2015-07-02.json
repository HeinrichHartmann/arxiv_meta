Our Local Group of galaxies appears to be moving relative to the\ncosmic microwave background with the source of the peculiar motion still\nuncertain. While in the past this has been studied mostly using galaxies as\ndistance indicators, the weight of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has increased\nrecently with the continuously improving statistics of available low-redshift\nsupernovae.\n  Aims. We measured the bulk flow in the nearby universe ($0.015 < z < 0.1$)\nusing 117 SNe Ia observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory, as well as the\nUnion2 compilation of SN Ia data already in the literature.\n  Methods. The bulk flow velocity was determined from SN data binned in\nredshift shells by including a coherent motion (dipole) in a cosmological fit.\nAdditionally, a method of spatially smoothing the Hubble residuals was used to\nverify the results of the dipole fit. To constrain the location and mass of a\npotential mass concentration (e.g., the Shapley supercluster) responsible for\nthe peculiar motion, we fit a Hubble law modified by adding an additional mass\nconcentration.\n  Results. The analysis shows a bulk flow that is consistent with the direction\nof the CMB dipole up to $z \\sim 0.06$, thereby doubling the volume over which\nconventional distance measures are sensitive to a bulk flow. We see no\nsignificant turnover behind the center of the Shapley supercluster. A simple\nattractor model in the proximity of the Shapley supercluster is only marginally\nconsistent with our data, suggesting the need for another, more distant source.\nIn the redshift shell $0.06 < z < 0.1$, we constrain the bulk flow velocity to\n$< 240~\\textrm{km s}^{-1}$ (68% confidence level) for the direction of the CMB\ndipole, in contradiction to recent claims of the existence of a large-amplitude\ndark flow.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures, added corrigendum\n  (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...578C...1F)"]}]

The\naggregated terrain type is formulated by the similar ground objects aggregated\ntogether. In this paper, a polarimetric hierarchical semantic model (PHSM) is\nfirstly proposed to overcome this disadvantage based on the constructions of a\nprimal-level and a middle-level semantic. The primal-level semantic is a\npolarimetric sketch map which consists of sketch segments as the sparse\nrepresentation of a PolSAR image. The middle-level semantic is a region map\nwhich can extract semantic homogenous regions from the sketch map by exploiting\nthe topological structure of sketch segments. Mapping the region map to the\nPolSAR image, a complex PolSAR scene is partitioned into aggregated, structural\nand homogenous pixel-level subspaces with the characteristics of relatively\ncoherent terrain types in each subspace. Then, according to the characteristics\nof three subspaces above, three specific methods are adopted, and furthermore\npolarimetric information is exploited to improve the segmentation result.\nExperimental results on PolSAR data sets with different bands and sensors\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art\nmethods in region homogeneity and edge preservation for terrain classification.\n"]}]

Text summarization has been studied for over\nhalf century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied\nsummary. Traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the\nfundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding.\nThis paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a\nmulti-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional\nmethodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and\nprinciples of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental\nmechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of\nrepresentations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms.\nInvestigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the\nsummarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general\nsummarization framework.\n"]}]

Heating the solar corona to several million degrees requires the\nconversion of magnetic energy into thermal energy. In this paper, we\ninvestigate whether an unstable magnetic thread within a coronal loop can\ndestabilise a neighbouring magnetic thread. Aims. By running a series of\nsimulations, we aim to understand under what conditions the destabilisation of\na single magnetic thread can also trigger a release of energy in a nearby\nthread. Methods. The 3D magnetohydrodynamics code, Lare3d, is used to simulate\nthe temporal evolution of coronal magnetic fields during a kink instability and\nthe subsequent relaxation process. We assume that a coronal magnetic loop\nconsists of non-potential magnetic threads that are initially in an equilibrium\nstate. Results. The non-linear kink instability in one magnetic thread forms a\nhelical current sheet and initiates magnetic reconnection. The current sheet\nfragments, and magnetic energy is released throughout that thread. We find\nthat, under certain conditions, this event can destabilise a nearby thread,\nwhich is a necessary requirement for starting an avalanche of energy release in\nmagnetic threads. Conclusions. It is possible to initiate an energy release in\na nearby, non-potential magnetic thread, because the energy released from one\nunstable magnetic thread can trigger energy release in nearby threads, provided\nthat the nearby structures are close to marginal stability.\n"]}]

We have designed a procedure to correct these\nartifacts by using orthogonal scan pairs to align each measurement line-by-line\nalong the slow scan direction. We demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm on\nboth synthetic and experimental data and provide an implementation of our\nmethod.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, LINK to supplementary material"]}]

We have constructed 1015-vertex graphs from\nthe diffusion MRI brain images of 395 human subjects and compared the\nindividual graphs with respect to several different areas of the brain. The\ninter-individual variability of the graphs within different brain regions was\ndiscovered and described. We have found that the frontal and the limbic lobes\nare more conservative, while the edges in the temporal and occipital lobes are\nmore diverse. Interestingly, a \"hybrid\" conservative and diverse distribution\nwas found in the paracentral lobule and the fusiform gyrus. Smaller cortical\nareas were also evaluated: precentral gyri were found to be more conservative,\nand the postcentral and the superior temporal gyri to be very diverse.\n"]}]
