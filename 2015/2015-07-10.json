In a large class of\nbaryogenesis models, the baryon asymmetry results from the out-of-equilibrium\ndecay of a new, massive particle. We highlight that in the interesting scenario\nwhere this particle has a weak scale mass, this out-of-equilibrium condition\nrequires a proper decay length larger than O(1) mm. Such new fields are within\nreach of the LHC, at which they can be pair produced leaving a distinctive,\ndisplaced-vertex signature.

In analogy to missing energy searches for WIMP\ndark matter, the LHC is an excellent probe of these new long-lived particles\nresponsible for baryogenesis via the low-background displaced vertex channel.\nIn our paper, we estimate the limits on simplified models inspired by WIMP\nbaryogenesis from two of the most sensitive collider searches by CMS and ATLAS\nwith 8 TeV LHC data.

The UV/X-ray correlation is weaker (r_max <\n0.45) and less consistent over time. This indicates that while Swift is\nbeginning to measure UV/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disk\ntheory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationship\nwith X-ray variability is less well understood.

We achieve this by numerically constructing slowly-rotating and\ntidally-deformed, anisotropic, compact stars in General Relativity to third\norder in spin.

These methods are therefore of little help in\npractical contexts, given that real interconnected networks have finite size\nand their structures are generally not compatible with those of graph toy\nmodels.

When the intersection dominates the remainders, an interconnected\nnetwork undergoes a continuous percolation transition. Conversely, if the\nintersection is dominated by the contribution of the remainders, the transition\nbecomes abrupt even in systems of finite size.

Although several experiments have shown ambipolar\ncarriers at the surface of a polar semiconductor BiTeI, their origin is yet to\nbe specified. Here we provide compelling experimental evidences that the\nambipolar 2D carriers at the surface of BiTeI are induced by the spontaneous\nelectric polarization. By imaging electron standing waves with spectroscopic\nimaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we find that positive or negative\ncarriers with Rashba-type spin splitting emerge at the surface correspondingly\nto the polar directions in the bulk. The electron densities at the surface are\nconstant independently of those in the bulk, corroborating that the 2D carriers\nare induced by the spontaneous electric polarization.

In this paper, a novel connectivity-aware approximation algorithm for\nrelay node placement in WSNs is proposed to offer a major step forward in\nsaving system overhead. Specifically, a unique Local Search Approximation\nAlgorithm (LSAA) is introduced to solve the Relay Node Single Cover (RNSC)\nproblem. In this proposed LSAA approach, the sensor nodes are allocated into\ngroups and then a local Set Cover (SC) for each group is achieved by a local\nsearch algorithm. The union set of all local SCs constitutes a SC of the RNSC\nproblem. The approximation ratio and the time complexity of the LSAA are\nanalyzed by rigorous proof. Additionally, the LSAA approach has been extended\nto solve the relay node double cover problem. Then, a Relay Location Selection\nAlgorithm (RLSA) is proposed to utilize the resulting SC from LSAA in combining\nRLSA with the minimum spanning tree heuristic to build the high-tier\nconnectivity. As the RLSA searches for a nearest location to the sink node for\neach relay node, the high-tier network built by RLSA becomes denser than that\nby existing works. As a result, the number of added relay nodes for building\nthe connectivity of the high-tier WSN can be significantly saved. Simulation\nresults clearly demonstrate that the proposed LSAA outperforms the approaches\nreported in literature and the RLSA-based algorithm can noticeably save relay\nnodes newly deployed for the high-tier connectivity.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 24 figures"]}]

The H infinity norm of a system measures its robustness by quantifying\nthe worst-case behavior of a system perturbed by a unit-energy disturbance.\nHowever, the disturbance that induces such worst-case behavior requires perfect\ncoordination among all disturbance channels. Given that many systems of\ninterest, such as the power grid, the internet and automated vehicle platoons,\nare large-scale and spatially distributed, such coordination may not be\npossible, and hence the H infinity norm, used as a measure of robustness, may\nbe too conservative.

The aim of this paper is to study the\nalgorithmic complexity of such \"typical\" networks. The contribution of this\nwork is twofold.\n  First, we define a deterministic condition for checking whether a graph has a\npower law degree distribution and experimentally validate it on real-world\nnetworks. This definition allows us to derive interesting properties of power\nlaw networks. We observe that for exponents of the degree distribution in the\nrange $[1,2]$ such networks exhibit double power law phenomenon that was\nobserved for several real-world networks. Our observation indicates that this\nphenomenon could be explained by just pure graph theoretical properties.\n  The second aim of our work is to give a novel theoretical explanation why\nmany algorithms run faster on real-world data than what is predicted by\nalgorithmic worst-case analysis. We show how to exploit the power law degree\ndistribution to design faster algorithms for a number of classical P-time\nproblems including transitive closure, maximum matching, determinant, PageRank\nand matrix inverse. Moreover, we deal with the problems of counting triangles\nand finding maximum clique. Previously, it has been only shown that these\nproblems can be solved very efficiently on power law graphs when these graphs\nare random, e.g., drawn at random from some distribution. However, it is\nunclear how to relate such a theoretical analysis to real-world graphs, which\nare fixed. Instead of that, we show that the randomness assumption can be\nreplaced with a simple condition on the degrees of adjacent vertices, which can\nbe used to obtain similar results. As a result, in some range of power law\nexponents, we are able to solve the maximum clique problem in polynomial time,\nalthough in general power law networks the problem is NP-complete.\n"]}]

Although the Density Functional is in\nthis case represented formally as the Hartree-Fock mean field of an effective\nforce, the corresponding single-particle states in general do not reproduce the\nphenomenology particularly well. To overcome this difficulty, a strategy has\nbeen developed where the effective force is adjusted to reproduce directly the\nsingle particle energies, trying to keep the ground state energy sufficiently\nwell reproduced.

Such warm temperatures appear necessary to generate the rainfall (or\nsnowfall) amounts required to carve the ancient martian valleys.

Our outgassing estimates assume that Mars was actively\nrecycling volatiles between its crust and interior, as Earth does today. H2\nproduction from serpentinization and deposition of banded iron-formations is\nalso considered. Under these assumptions, maintaining an H2 concentration of\n~1-2% by volume is achievable, but reaching 5% H2 requires additional H2\nsources or a slowing of the hydrogen escape rate below the diffusion limit. If\nthe early martian atmosphere was indeed H2-rich, we might be able to see\nevidence of this in the rock record. The hypothesis proposed here is consistent\nwith new data from the Curiosity Rover, which show evidence for a long-lived\nlake in Gale Crater near Mt. Sharp.
