Our\nexperiment does not support that this association is due to a luminosity bias\n(91T-like being brighter than normal Ia). We therefore conclude that this\nassociation has real physical origins and we propose that 91T-like explosions\nresult from single degenerate progenitors. Despite the similarities between SNe\nIbc and SNe Ia, the number of misclassifications between these types was small\nand mostly at low S/N. Combined with the luminosity function needed to\nreproduce the observed SN Ia-CSM luminosities, it is unlikely that SNe Ibc\nconstitute an important contaminant within this sample. We show how Type II\nspectra transition to IIn and how the Ha profiles vary with fv. SNe IIn fainter\nthan M = -17.2 are unable to mask SNe IIP brighter than M = -15.

In a two-user GIC, the rate pairs where\none user transmits its data at the single-user capacity (without interference),\nand the other at the largest rate for which reliable communication is still\npossible are called corner points. This paper relies on existing outer bounds\non the capacity region of a two-user GIC that are used to derive informative\nbounds on the corner points of the capacity region.

The bounds on the corner points are asymptotically tight\nas the transmitted powers tend to infinity, and they are also useful for the\ncase of moderate SNR and INR.

Understanding why stellar evolution yields different types of stellar\nexplosions in these environments is fundamental in order to both uncover the\nelusive progenitors of SLSNe and to study star formation in dwarf galaxies. In\nthis paper, we present the first results of our project to study SUperluminous\nSupernova Host galaxIES, focusing on the sample for which we have obtained\nspectroscopy. We show that SLSNe-I and SLSNe-R (hydrogen-poor) often (~50% in\nour sample) occur in a class of galaxies that is known as Extreme Emission Line\nGalaxies (EELGs). The probability of this happening by chance is negligible and\nwe therefore conclude that the extreme environmental conditions and the SLSN\nphenomenon are related. In contrast, SLSNe-II (hydrogen-rich) occur in more\nmassive, more metal-rich galaxies with softer radiation fields. Therefore, if\nSLSNe-II constitute a uniform class, their progenitor systems are likely\ndifferent from those of H-poor SLSNe. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are, on average,\nnot found in as extreme environments as H-poor SLSNe. We propose that H-poor\nSLSNe result from the very first stars exploding in a starburst, even earlier\nthan GRBs. This might indicate a bottom-light initial mass function in these\nsystems. SLSNe present a novel method of selecting candidate EELGs independent\nof their luminosity.\n","Comment: Published version, matches proofs.

To begin with, we apply an approx. preserving graph reduction on\nMMUP to obtain a new problem namely the min-partial order problem (min-POP)(a\nstrict generalization of the min-feedback arc set problem). The reduction\ninvolves introduction of rigid edges which are edges that demand strict\ninclusion in output solution. To solve min-POP, we use the Leighton- Rao\ndivide-&-conquer paradigm that provides solutions to SDP-formulated instances\nof min-directed balanced cut with rigid edges (min-DBCRE). Our first algorithm\nfor min-DBCRE extends Agarwal et al.'s rounding procedure for digraph\nformulation of ARV-algorithm to handle rigid edges. Our second algorithm to\nsolve min-DBCRE SDP, adapts Arora et al.'s primal dual MWUM. In terms of\napplications, under the mild assumption1 of the size of topological features\nbeing significantly smaller compared to the size of the complex, we obtain an\n(a) $\\tilde{O}(N)$ algorithm for computing homology groups $H_i(K,A)$ of a\nsimplicial complex K, (where A is an arbitrary Abelian group.) (b) an\n$\\tilde{O}(N^2)$ algorithm for computing persistent homology and (c) an\n$\\tilde{O}(N)$ algorithm for computing the optimal discrete Morse-Witten\nfunction compatible with input scalar function as simple consequences of our\napproximation algorithm for MMUP thereby giving us the best known complexity\nbounds for each of these applications under the aforementioned assumption. Such\nan assumption is realistic in applied settings, and often a characteristic of\nmodern massive datasets.\n","Comment: 80pages, 25 figures, preprint (yet to be submitted), resolves an open\n  problem in computational topology, Nearly linear time Approximation Algorithm\n  with widescale applications in computational topology, section on MWUM-based\n  solution expanded/made clearer"]}]

Therefore, surface roughness and remote surface\nroughness can not be modeled as two independent mechanisms. RSR tends to\nenhance the total mobility when the Si/SiO$_2$ interface and SiO$_2$ thickness\nprofiles are correlated, and to decrease the total mobility when they are\nanti-correlated.

However IT companies\noften face a problem while recruiting new people for their ongoing projects due\nto lack of a proper framework that defines a criteria for the selection\nprocess. In this paper we aim to develop a framework that would allow any\nproject manager to take the right decision for selecting new talent by\ncorrelating performance parameters with the other domain-specific attributes of\nthe candidates. Also, another important motivation behind this project is to\ncheck the validity of the selection procedure often followed by various big\ncompanies in both public and private sectors which focus only on academic\nscores, GPA/grades of students from colleges and other academic backgrounds. We\ntest if such a decision will produce optimal results in the industry or is\nthere a need for change that offers a more holistic approach to recruitment of\nnew talent in the software companies. The scope of this work extends beyond the\nIT domain and a similar procedure can be adopted to develop a recruitment\nframework in other fields as well. Data-mining techniques provide useful\ninformation from the historical projects depending on which the hiring-manager\ncan make decisions for recruiting high-quality workforce. This study aims to\nbridge this hiatus by developing a data-mining framework based on an\nensemble-learning technique to refocus on the criteria for personnel selection.\nThe results from this research clearly demonstrated that there is a need to\nrefocus on the selection-criteria for quality objectives.\n","Comment: Data Mining for Prediction of Human Performance Capability in the\n  Software-Industry, International Journal of Data-Mining and Knowledge\n  Management Process (IJDKP) - March 2015 Issue"]}]

Formal demography has a long history of building simple models of\nage schedules of demographic quantities, e.g. mortality and fertility rates.\nThese are widely used in demographic methods to manipulate whole age schedules\nusing few parameters.\n  OBJECTIVE. The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) factorizes a matrix into\nthree matrices with useful properties including the ability to reconstruct the\noriginal matrix using many fewer, simple matrices. This work demonstrates how\nthese properties can be exploited to build parsimonious models of whole age\nschedules of demographic quantities that can be further parameterized in terms\nof arbitrary covariates.\n  METHODS. The SVD is presented and explained in detail with attention to\ndeveloping an intuitive understanding. The SVD is used to construct a general,\ncomponent model of demographic age schedules, and that model is demonstrated\nwith age-specific mortality and fertility rates. Finally, the model is used (1)\nto predict age-specific mortality using HIV indicators and summary measures of\nage-specific mortality, and (2) to predict age-specific fertility using the\ntotal fertility rate (TFR).\n  RESULTS. The component model of age-specific mortality and fertility rates\nsucceeds in reproducing the data with two inputs, and acting through those two\ninputs, various covariates are able to accurately predict full age schedules.\n  CONCLUSIONS. The SVD is potentially useful as a way to summarize, smooth and\nmodel age-specific demographic quantities. The component model is a general\nmethod of relating covariates to whole age schedules.\n  COMMENTS. The focus of this work is the SVD and the component model. The\napplications are for illustrative purposes only.\n","Comment: 65 pages, 40 figures, University of Washington Center for Statistics\n  and the Social Sciences (CSSS) Working Paper No. 143"]}]
