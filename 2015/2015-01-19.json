The key to successful weak lensing\nexperiments is in measuring the shapes of detected sources to high accuracy. In\nthis document we describe a simulation pipeline designed to simulate radio\nimages of the quality required for weak lensing, and will be typical of SKA\nobservations. We provide as input, images with realistic galaxy shapes which\nare then simulated to produce images as they would have been observed with a\ngiven radio interferometer.

In this survey, we give a\ngeneralization of geodesic laminations on surfaces endowed with a\nhalf-translation structure, called flat laminations, and we define transverse\nmeasures on flat laminations similar to transverse measures on hyperbolic\nlaminations, taking into account that the images of the leaves of a flat\nlamination are in general not pairwise disjoint. One aim is to construct a tool\nthat could allow a fine description of the space of degenerations of\nhalf-translation structures on a surface. We define a topology on the set of\nmeasured flat laminations and a natural continuous projection of the space of\nmeasured flat laminations onto the space of measured hyperbolic laminations,\nfor any arbitrary half-translation structure and hyperbolic metric on a\nsurface. We prove in particular that the space of measured flat laminations is\nprojectively compact. The main result of this survey is a classification\ntheorem of (measured) flat laminations on a compact surface endowed with a\nhalf-translation structure. We also give an exposition of that every finite\nmetric fat graph, outside four homeomorphisms classes, is the support of\nuncountably many measured flat laminations with uncountably many leaves none of\nwhich is eventually periodic, and that the space of measured flat laminations\nis separable and projectively compact.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1412.1994"]}]
