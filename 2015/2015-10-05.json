Consequently,\nthey exhibit the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly, which in this condensed matter\nrealization implies that application of parallel electric ($\\mathbf{E}$) and\nmagnetic ($\\mathbf{B}$) fields pumps electrons between nodes of opposite\nchirality at a rate proportional to $\\mathbf{E}\\cdot\\mathbf{B}$.

A probe magnetic\nfield can then convert this imbalance into a measurable voltage drop far from\nsource and drain. Such nonlocal transport vanishes when the injected current\nand magnetic field are orthogonal, and therefore serves as a test of the chiral\nanomaly.

The\nlatter may be unexpected, given the popularity of gas density threshold models\nto explain SF scaling relations. We used the IRAM 30-m telescope to observe\nHCN(1-0) across 29 nearby disk galaxies whose CO(2-1) emission has previously\nbeen mapped by the HERACLES survey. Because our observations span a range of\ngalactocentric radii, we are able to investigate the properties of the dense\ngas as a function of local conditions. We focus on how the IR/CO, HCN/CO, and\nIR/HCN ratios (observational cognates of the SFE, dense gas fraction, and dense\ngas SFE) depend on the stellar surface density and the molecular/atomic ratio.\nThe HCN/CO ratio correlates tightly with these two parameters across a range of\n2.1 dex and increases in the high surface density parts of galaxies.\nSimultaneously, the IR/HCN ratio decreases systematically with these same\nparameters and is ~6-8 times lower near galaxy centers than in the outer\nregions. For fixed line-mass conversion factors, these results are incompatible\nwith a simple model in which SF depends only on the gas mass above some density\nthreshold. Only a specific set of environment-dependent conversion factors can\nrender our observations compatible with such a model. Whole cloud models, such\nas the theory of turbulence regulated SF, do a better job of matching our data.\nWe explore one such model in which variations in the Mach number and in the\nmean density would respectively drive the trends within galaxy disks and the\ndifferences between disk and merging galaxies (abridged).\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astronomical Journal. 43 pages, 27\n  Figures"]}]

In the studies\nof practical BQC protocol, an important problem is how to reduce the quantum\nrequirement of the client. Multi-server BQC protocols have been proposed to\nsolve this problem. We review the double-server and triple-server protocols [Li\net al., Phys. Rev. A 89, 040302(R) (2014)], and propose a modified\ndouble-server BQC protocol with a trusted center. In our protocol, the servers\nare allowed to communicate mutually, and the client is completely classical.\nFurthermore, our double-server protocol can be modified into a single-server\nprotocol by simply combining the two servers. Compared with the triple-server\nprotocol, our double-server and single-server protocols are more simple and the\nclient is not required to have the ability to access quantum channel. So our\nprotocols are more practical when quantum computer is applied in the `cloud'\nmodel.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure"]}]

We first consider the \"pure\"\n$\\alpha-$process of symmetric preferential attachment (with the same in- and\nout-degrees), and study emergence of burst and spike synchronization by varying\nthe coupling strength $J$ and the noise intensity $D$ for a fixed attachment\ndegree. Characterizations of burst and spike synchronization are also made by\nemploying realistic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures. Next,\nwe choose appropriate values of $J$ and $D$ where only the burst\nsynchronization occurs, and investigate the effect of the scale-free\nconnectivity on the burst synchronization by varying (1) the symmetric\nattachment degree and (2) the asymmetry parameter (representing deviation from\nthe symmetric case) in the $\\alpha-$process, and (3) the occurrence probability\nof the $\\beta-$process. In all these three cases, changes in the type and the\ndegree of population synchronization are studied in connection with the network\ntopology such as the degree distribution, the average path length $L_p$, and\nthe betweenness centralization $B_c$. It is thus found that not only $L_p$ and\n$B_c$ (affecting global communication between nodes) but also the in-degree\ndistribution (affecting individual dynamics) are important network factors for\neffective population synchronization in SFNs.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1504.03063"]}]

Recent stellar evolution models naturally predict pair instability\nsupernovae (PISNe) from very massive stars at wide range of metallicities (up\nto Z=0.006, Yusof et al. 2013). In the scope of this study we analyse whether\nPISN models can match the observational properties of SLSNe with various light\ncurve shapes. Specifically, we explore the influence of different degrees of\nmacroscopic chemical mixing in PISN explosive products on the resulting\nobservational properties. We artificially apply mixing to the 250 Msun PISN\nevolutionary model from Kozyreva et al. (2014) and explore its supernova\nevolution with the one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics code STELLA. The\ngreatest success in matching SLSN observations is achieved in the case of an\nextreme macroscopic mixing, where all radioactive material is ejected into the\nhydrogen-helium outer layer. Such an extreme macroscopic redistribution of\nchemicals produces events with faster light curves with high photospheric\ntemperatures and high photospheric velocities. These properties fit a wider\nrange of SLSNe than non-mixed PISN model. Our mixed models match the light\ncurves, colour temperature and photospheric velocity evolution of two\nwell-observed SLSNe PTF12dam and LSQ12dlf. However, these models' extreme\nchemical redistribution may be hard to realise in massive PISNe.

The examination of standard errors in\nmodel-based clustering is therefore typically neglected. The widely used R\npackage mclust has recently introduced bootstrap and weighted likelihood\nbootstrap methods to facilitate standard error estimation.
