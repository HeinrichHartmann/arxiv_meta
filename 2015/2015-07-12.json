Two associated difference equations are also studied. The\nsolutions in the complex plane of such equations exhibit many rich and\ncomplicated asymptotic behavior. The analysis of the local stability of these\nthree difference equations and periodicity have been carried out. We further\nexhibit several interesting characteristics of the solutions of this equation,\nusing computations, which does not arise when we consider the same equation\nwith positive real parameters and initial conditions. Many interesting\nobservations led us to pose several open problems and conjectures of paramount\nimportance regarding chaotic and higher order periodic solutions and global\nasymptotic convergence of such difference equations. It is our hope that these\nobservations of these complex difference equations would certainly be new\nadd-ons to the present art of research in rational difference equations in\nunderstanding the behavior in the complex domain.\n","Comment: Preprint"]}]
