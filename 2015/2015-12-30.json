The Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) aims to image a 7\ndeg2 region centred on the European Large Area ISO Survey - South 1 (ELAIS-S1)\nfield and the Chandra Deep Field South (CDF-S) at 1.4 GHz with high sensitivity\n(up to ~10 \\muJy) to study the evolution of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) over a wide range of cosmic time. Aims. We present\nhere ancillary radio observations at a frequency of 2.3 GHz obtained with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The main goal of this is to study the\nradio spectra of an unprecedented large sample of sources (~2000 observed, ~600\ndetected in both frequencies). Methods. With this paper, we provide 2.3 GHz\nsource catalogues for both ATLAS fields, with a detection limit of 300 \\muJy.\nWe compute spectral indices between 1.4 GHz and 2.3 GHz using matched\nresolution images and investigate various properties of our source sample in\ndependence of their spectral indices. Results. We find the entire source sample\nto have a median spectral index of 0.74, in good agreement with both the\ncanonical value of 0.7 for optically thin synchrotron radiation and other\nspectral index studies conducted by various groups. Regarding the radio\nspectral index as indicator for source type, we find only marginal correlations\nso that flat or inverted spectrum sources are usually powered by AGN and hence\nconclude that at least for the faint population the spectral index is not a\nstrong discriminator. We investigate relation between spectral index and\nredshift for our source sample and find no such correlation at all. We do find\na significant correlation between redshift and radio to near-infrared flux\nratio, making this a much stronger tracer of high-z radio sources. We also find\nno evidence for a dependence of the radio-IR correlation on spectral index.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication by A&A, Table 2 will\n  be available electronically once published"]}]

The Keating model is based on atomistic modeling of elastic\ninteractions in binary alloy using harmonic springs with species dependent\nequilibrium lengths. It is demonstrated that the continuum limit for the strain\nfield are the usual equations of linear elasticity for alloys and that they\ncorrectly capture the coarse-grained displacement field. In addition, it is\nestablished that Euler-Lagrange equation of the continuum limit of the elastic\nenergy will yield the same strain field equation. However, a direct calculation\nof the elastic energy of the atomistic model reveals that the continuum\nexpression for the elastic energy is both qualitatively and quantitatively\nincorrect. This is because it does not take atomistic scale compositional\nnon-uniformity into account. Importantly, we also shows that finely mixed\nalloys tend to have more elastic energy than segregated systems, which is the\nopposite of predictions by some continuum theories. It is also shown that for\nstrained thin films the traditionally used effective misfit for alloys\nsystematically underestimate the strain energy. In some models, this drawback\nis handled by including an elastic contribution to the enthalpy of mixing which\nis characterized in terms of the continuum concentration. The direct\ncalculation of the atomistic model reveals that this approach suffers serious\ndifficulties.

We point out, in the 4D spatially flat FLRW\nuniverse, that the causal structure of transverse-traceless (TT) gravitational\nwaves can be elucidated by first reducing the problem to a 2D Minkowski wave\nequation with a time dependent potential, where the relevant Green's function\nis pure tail -- waves produced by a physical source propagate strictly within\nthe null cone. By viewing this 2D world as embedded in a 4D one, the 2D Green's\nfunction can also be seen to be sourced by a cylindrically symmetric scalar\nfield in 3D. From both the 2D wave equation as well as the 3D scalar\nperspective, we recover the exact solution of the 4D graviton tail, for the\ncase where the scale factor written in conformal time is a power law. There are\nno TT gravitational wave tails when the universe is radiation dominated because\nthe background Ricci scalar is zero. In a matter dominated one, we estimate the\namplitude of the tail to be suppressed relative to its null counterpart by both\nthe ratio of the duration of the source to the age of the universe $\\eta_0$,\nand the ratio of the observer-source spatial distance (at the observer's time)\nto the same $\\eta_0$. In a universe driven primarily by a cosmological\nconstant, the tail contribution to the background FLRW geometry after the\nsource has ceased, is the conformal factor $a^2$ times a spacetime-constant\nsymmetric matrix proportional to the spacetime volume integral of the TT part\nof the source's stress-energy-momentum tensor. In other words, massless spin-2\ngravitational waves exhibit a tail-induced memory effect in 4D de Sitter\nspacetime.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 2 figures"]}]

Conditions for a measurement to be MPE were\nderived by Yuen, Kennedy and Lax (YKL). MPE measurements have been found for\nstates that form a single orbit under a group action, i.e., there is a\ntransitive group action on the states in the set. For such state sets, termed\ngeometrically uniform (GU) by Forney, it was shown that the `pretty good\nmeasurement' (PGM) attains the MPE. Even so, evaluating the actual probability\nof error (and other performance metrics) attained by the PGM on a GU set\ninvolves inverting large matrices, and is not easy in general. Our first\ncontribution is a formula for the MPE and conditional probabilities of GU sets,\nusing group representation theory. Next, we consider sets of pure states that\nhave multiple orbits under the group action. Such states are termed compound\ngeometrically uniform (CGU). MPE measurements for general CGU sets are not\nknown. In this paper, we show how our representation-theoretic description of\noptimal measurements for GU sets naturally generalizes to the CGU case. We show\nhow to compute the MPE measurement for CGU sets by reducing the problem to\nsolving a few simultaneous equations. The number of equations depends on the\nsizes of the multiplicity space of irreducible representations. For many common\ngroup representations (such as those of several practical good linear codes),\nthis is much more tractable than solving large semi-definite programs---which\nis what is needed to solve the YKL conditions numerically for arbitrary state\nsets.

The\ntheoretical description of the interaction depends on the combination of a\nnuclear model with the knowledge of form factors. While the former has received\nconsiderable attention, the latter, in particular the axial form factor, is\nimplemented using the historical dipole model. Instead, we use a\nmodel-independent approach, presented in a previous study, to analyze the muon\nantineutrino CCQE mineral oil data published by the MiniBooNE collaboration. We\ncombine the cross section for scattering of antineutrinos off protons in carbon\nand hydrogen, using the same axial form factor for both. The extracted value of\nthe axial mass parameter $m_A = 0.84^{+0.12}_{-0.04} \\pm {0.11} \\, {\\rm GeV}$\nis in very good agreement with the model-independent value extracted from\nMiniBooNE's neutrino data. Going beyond a one-parameter description of the\naxial form factor, we extract values of the axial form factor in the range of\n$Q^2=0.1...1.0$ GeV$^2$, finding a very good agreement with the analogous\nextraction from the neutrino data. We discuss the implications of these\nresults.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures"]}]
