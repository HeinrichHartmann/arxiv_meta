However, to date,\npractical statistical methods which can include group dynamics in animal\nmovement models have been lacking. We consider a flexible modelling framework\nthat distinguishes a group-level model, describing the movement of the group's\ncentre, and an individual-level model, such that each individual makes its\nmovement decisions relative to the group centroid. The basic idea is framed\nwithin the flexible class of hidden Markov models, extending previous work on\nmodelling animal movement by means of multi-state random walks.

We illustrate the approach using real\nmovement data from 11 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). Results indicate a\ndirectional bias towards a group centroid for reindeer in an encamped state.\nThough the attraction to the group centroid is relatively weak, our model\nsuccessfully captures group-influenced movement dynamics.

Through analysis of a massive dataset on traffic to Wikipedia, we\nfind that the production of new knowledge is associated to significant shifts\nof collective attention, which we take as a proxy for its demand. What we\nobserve is consistent with a scenario in which the allocation of attention\ntoward a topic stimulates the demand for information about it, and in turn the\nsupply of further novel information. Our attempt to quantify demand and supply\nof information, and our finding about their temporal ordering, may lead to the\ndevelopment of the fundamental laws of the attention economy, and a better\nunderstanding of the social exchange of knowledge in online and offline\ninformation networks.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]}]

A key factor to design a DSA\nnetwork is the spectrum sensing algorithms for multiple channels with multiple\nusers. Multi-user cooperative channel sensing reduces the sensing time, and\nthus it increases transmission throughput. However, in a multi-channel system,\nthe problem becomes more complex since the benefits of assigning users to sense\nchannels in parallel must also be considered. A sensing schedule, indicating to\neach user the channel that it should sense at different sensing moments, must\nbe thus created to optimize system performance. In this paper, we formulate the\ngeneral sensing scheduling optimization problem and then propose several\nsensing strategies to schedule the users according to network parameters with\nhomogeneous sensors. Later on we extend the results to heterogeneous sensors\nand propose a robust scheduling design when we have traffic and channel\nuncertainty. We propose three sensing strategies, and, within each one of them,\nseveral solutions, striking a balance between throughput performance and\ncomputational complexity, are proposed. In addition, we show that a sequential\nchannel sensing strategy is the one to be preferred when the sensing time is\nsmall, the number of channels is large, and the number of users is small. For\nall the other cases, a parallel channel sensing strategy is recommended in\nterms of throughput performance. We also show that a proposed hybrid\nsequential-parallel channel sensing strategy achieves the best performance in\nall scenarios at the cost of extra memory and computation complexity.\n"]}]

Our aim is to use rotational evolution models to\nconstrain the mass loss rates in stellar winds and to predict how their\nproperties evolve with time on the main-sequence.\n  Methods: We construct a rotational evolution model that is driven by observed\nrotational distributions of young stellar clusters. Fitting the free parameters\nin our model allows us to predict how wind mass loss rate depends on stellar\nmass, radius, and rotation. We couple the results to the wind model developed\nin Paper I of this series to predict how wind properties evolve on the\nmain-sequence.\n  Results: We estimate that wind mass loss rate scales with stellar parameters\nas $\\dot{M}_\\star \\propto R_\\star^2 \\Omega_\\star^{1.33} M_\\star^{-3.36}$. We\nestimate that at young ages, the solar wind likely had a mass loss rate that is\nan order of magnitude higher than that of the current solar wind. This leads to\nthe wind having a higher density at younger ages; however, the magnitude of\nthis change depends strongly on how we scale wind temperature. Due to the\nspread in rotation rates, young stars show a large range of wind properties at\na given age. This spread in wind properties disappears as the stars age.\n  Conclusions: There is a large uncertainty in our knowledge of the evolution\nof stellar winds on the main-sequence, due both to our lack of knowledge of\nstellar winds and the large spread in rotation rates at young ages.

The\nmore recent investigation of adhesives by probe-tack methods also revealed the\nimportance of cavitation and stringing mechanisms during debonding, underlining\nthe influence of large deformations and of the related non-linear response of\nthe material, which also intervenes during peeling. Although a global modelling\nof the complex coupling of all these ingredients remains a formidable issue, we\nreport here some key experiments and modelling arguments that should constitute\nan important step forward.

Despite\nmuch progress on exact geometric computing, the fact that the degree of the\npolynomial increases with $d$ makes the evaluation of the sign of such a\npolynomial problematic except in very low dimensions.

It has been found\nthat three stages can be identified in the relaxation of the L23-water system\nunder study. At the first stage, a portion of water at the removal of excess\npressure rapidly flows out in the pressure reduction time, i.e., following a\ndecrease in the pressure. It has been shown that, at temperatures below the\ndispersion transition temperature $T < T_d = 284 K$, e.g., $T = 277 K$, the\ndegree of filling ${\\theta}$ decreases from 1 to 0.8 in 10 s, following the\nvariation of excess pressure. At the second stage of relaxation, the degree of\nfilling ${\\theta}$ varies slowly according to a power law ${\\theta} \\sim\nt^{-\\alpha}$ with the exponent ${\\alpha} < 0.1$ in the time $t \\sim 10^5$ s.\nThis corresponds to a slow relaxation of the formed metastable state of the\nnonwetting liquid in the porous medium. At the third stage when $t > 10^5$ s,\nthe formed metastable state decays, which is manifested in the transition to a\npower-law dependence ${\\theta}(t)$ with a larger exponent. The extrusion-time\ndistribution function of pores has been calculated along with the time\ndependence of the degree of filling, which qualitatively describes the observed\nanomalously slow relaxation and crossover of the transition to the stage of\ndecay with a power-law dependence ${\\theta}(t)$ with a larger exponent. It has\nbeen shown that the relaxation and decay of the metastable state of the\nconfined nonwetting liquid at ${\\theta}>{\\theta_c}$ are attributed to the\nappearance of local configurations of liquid clusters in confinement and their\ninteraction inside the infinite percolation cluster of filled pores.\n"]}]

More specifically, the\nfocus of this paper is on the additive exponential noise (AEN) channel, and\nlossy compression of exponential sources. Taking advantage of the essential\ndecomposable property of these channels (sources), the proposed expansion\nmethod allows for mapping of these problems to coding over parallel channels\n(respectively, sources), where each level is modeled as an independent coding\nproblem over discrete alphabets. Any feasible solution to the resulting\noptimization problem after expansion corresponds to an achievable scheme of the\noriginal problem. Utilizing this mapping, even for the cases where the optimal\nsolutions are difficult to characterize, it is shown that the expansion coding\nscheme still performs well with appropriate choices of parameters. More\nspecifically, theoretical analysis and numerical results reveal that expansion\ncoding achieves the capacity of AEN channel in the high SNR regime. It is also\nshown that for lossy compression, the achievable rate distortion pair by\nexpansion coding approaches to the Shannon limit in the low distortion region.\nRemarkably, by using capacity-achieving codes with low encoding and decoding\ncomplexity that are originally designed for discrete alphabets, for instance\npolar codes, the proposed expansion coding scheme allows for designing\nlow-complexity analog channel and source codes.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 10 figures"]}]

These\nimaging data are often represented in the form of a multi-dimensional array,\ncalled a tensor. Existing statistical methods are insufficient for analysis of\nthese tensor data due to their ultra-high dimensionality as well as their\ncomplex structure. The aim of this paper is to develop a tensor partition\nregression modeling (TPRM) framework to establish an association between\nlow-dimensional clinical outcomes and ultra-high dimensional tensor covariates.\nOur TPRM is a hierarchical model and efficiently integrates four components:\n(i) a partition model; (ii) a canonical polyadic decomposition model; (iii) a\nfactor model; and (iv) a generalized linear model. Under this framework,\nultra-high dimensionality is not only reduced to a manageable level, resulting\ninefficient estimation, but also prediction accuracy is optimized to search for\ninformative sub-tensors. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithm. Simulation shows that TPRM outperforms several\nother competing methods.
