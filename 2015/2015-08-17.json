Proving mathematically that such individual-level processes can\ncause observed population-level patterns to form is necessary for linking these\ntwo levels of description in a non-speculative way.

The resulting PDE does not rely on attraction to\nspatial locations, but purely on conspecific avoidance, mediated via\nscent-marking. We show analytically that steady-state patterns can form, as\nlong as (i) the scent does not decay faster than it takes the animal to\ntraverse the terrain, and (ii) the spatial scale over which animals detect\nscent is incorporated into the PDE.

Geometric frustration proposes that a\ntransition to a crystalline state is frustrated because these LFS do not tile\nspace. However, this concept is based on icosahedra which are not always the\nLFS for a given system. The LFS of the popular Kob-Andersen (KA) model\nglassformer is the bicapped square antiprism, which does tile space. Such an\nLFS-crystal is indeed realised in the $\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ structure, which is\npredicted to be a low energy state for the KA model with a 2:1 composition. We\ntherefore hypothesise that upon changing the composition in the KA model\ntowards 2:1, geometric frustration may be progressively relieved, leading to\nlarger and larger domains of LFS which would ultimately correspond to the\n$\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal. Remarkably, rather than an increase, upon changing\ncomposition we find a small decrease in the LFS population, and the system\nremains impervious to nucleation of LFS crystals. We suggest that this may be\nrelated to the composition of the LFS, as only a limited subset are compatible\nwith the crystal. We further demonstrate that the $\\mathrm{Al_{2}Cu}$ crystal\nwill grow from a seed in the KA model with 2:1 composition and identify the\nmelting temperature to be 0.447(2).\n","Comment: submitted to JCP"]}]

This is\nmainly due to the necessary spectral decomposition step, which limits control\nover the mapping from the original high-dimensional space to the embedding\nspace. Here, we propose an alternative approach that demands a two-dimensional\nembedding which topologically summarizes the high-dimensional data. In this\nsense, our approach is closely related to the construction of one-dimensional\nprincipal curves that minimize orthogonal error to data points subject to\nsmoothness constraints. Specifically, we construct a two-dimensional principal\nmanifold directly in the high-dimensional space using cubic smoothing splines,\nand define the embedding coordinates in terms of geodesic distances. Thus, the\nmapping from the high-dimensional data to the manifold is defined in terms of\nlocal coordinates. Through representative examples, we show that compared to\nexisting nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods, the principal manifold\nretains the original structure even in noisy and sparse datasets. The principal\nmanifold finding algorithm is applied to configurations obtained from a\ndynamical system of multiple agents simulating a complex maneuver called\npredator mobbing, and the resulting two-dimensional embedding is compared with\nthat of a well-established nonlinear dimensionality reduction method.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures, journal article"]}]

In this method, we\nconsider a gas blob or ring falling onto a black hole from the marginally\nstable orbit, keeping its initial orbital angular momentum. We calculate the\ngas motion and photon trajectories in the Kerr space-time and, assuming that\nthe gas blob or ring emits monochromatic radiation, carefully examine how it is\nobserved by a distant observer. The light curve of the orbiting gas blob is\ncomposed of many peaks because of periodic enhancement of the flux due to the\ngravitational lensing and beaming effects. Further, the intensity of each peak\nfirst gradually increases with time due to the focusing effect around the\nphoton circular orbit and then rapidly decreases due to the gravitational\nredshift, as the gas blob approaches the event horizon. The light curve of the\ngas ring is equivalent to a superposition of those of the blobs with various\ninitial orbital phases, and so it is continuous and with no peaks. The flux\nfirst gradually increases and then rapidly decays, as in the blob model. The\nflux variation timescale depends on the black hole spin and is independent from\nthe inclination angle, while time averaged frequency shift have dependences of\nboth effects. We can thus, in principle, determine spin and inclination angle\nfrom observations.

The\nweight coefficients are chosen from a finite weight set and L, called\nmeasurement degree, is obtained based on a predefined degree distribution\nfunction.

Two such examples with a biological\napplicability are stiff membranes, which allow for the sliding of joints and\ntherefore maintain their function over the lifetime of the corresponding\nindividual (decades) and the softening of cell membranes, for example for\nantimicrobial effects by dissolution in the case of bacteria (seconds).

Repetitions of such phenomenon as a successive\nself-similar event is also known as coalescence cascade. In a nutshell,\ncomplete coalescence is governed strongly by swallowing mechanism whereas\npartial coalescence is attributed to slippage mechanism and solutal Marangoni\nflow.

Recently, it has been pointed out that several basic features of\navalanche dynamics are induced at the microscopic level by relaxation\nprocesses, which are neglected by most models. During my thesis, I studied two\nwell-known models of avalanche dynamics, modified minimally by the inclusion of\nsome forms of relaxation.\n  The first system is that of a viscoelastic interface driven in a disordered\nmedium. In mean-field, we prove that the interface has a periodic behaviour\n(with a new, emerging time scale), with avalanche events that span the whole\nsystem. We compute semi-analytically the friction force acting on this surface,\nand find that it is compatible with classical friction experiments. In finite\ndimensions (2D), the mean-field system-sized events become local, and numerical\nsimulations give qualitative and quantitative results in good agreement with\nseveral important features of real earthquakes.\n  The second system including a minimal form of relaxation consists in a toy\nmodel of avalanches: the Directed Percolation process. In our study of a\nnon-Markovian variant of Directed Percolation, we observed that the\nuniversality class was modified but not completely. In particular, in the\nnon-Markov case an exponent changes of value while several scaling relations\nstill hold.

This is a natural problem\nthat captures scenarios where a small fraction of points in the input\ncorresponds to noise.\n  For the case of isometric embeddings we derive polynomial-time approximation\nalgorithms for minimizing the number of outliers when the target space is an\nultrametric, a tree metric, or constant-dimensional Euclidean space.
