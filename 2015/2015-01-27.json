The three components are clearly separated because they arise on\ndistinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their\ninfluences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at\n~7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet\nthat bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small. Our\nGalaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local\nVoid. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the\nVirgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest\ncomponent is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km/s and centered near\nthe direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components\nare 259, 185, and 455 km/s, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km/s in\nthe reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby influences into\naccount causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed\nconcentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion\nattributed to their pull. On small scales, in addition to the motion of our\nLocal Sheet away from the Local Void, the nearest adjacent filament, the Leo\nSpur, is seen to be moving in a direction that will lead to convergence with\nour filament. Finally, a good distance to an isolated galaxy within the Local\nVoid reveals that this dwarf system has a motion of at least 230 km/s away from\nthe void center. Given the velocities expected from gravitational instability\ntheory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the\nLocal Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position.

Almost\nall nxn matrices over an infinite field have a rigidity of (n-r)^2. It is a\nlong-standing open question to construct infinite families of explicit matrices\neven with superlinear rigidity when r = Omega(n).\n  In this paper, we construct an infinite family of complex matrices with the\nlargest possible, i.e., (n-r)^2, rigidity.

In this paper, we\nprovide forecasts for the $TT$, $EE$, and $TE$ angular power spectra for the\nPlanck mission. Our forecasts are made using synthetic data based on the\nbest-fit $\\Lambda$CDM model while conforming to the characteristics and\nparameters of the Planck mission. We have analysed such synthetic data sets\nusing a nonparametric function estimation formalism that is otherwise\nasymptotically model-independent. Indeed, the power spectra estimated from such\nsynthetic data turn out to be sufficiently close to the corresponding\n$\\Lambda$CDM spectra. Our analysis further indicates that the three angular\npower spectra are determined sufficiently well for $2 \\le l \\lesssim l_{max}$,\nwhere $l_{max} = 2500 {($TT$),} 1377 {($EE$), and} 1727 {($TE$)}$ respectively.\nA signature of reionization is evident in the $EE$ and $TE$ power spectra in\nthe form of a bump at low $l$s ...\n"]}]

We term this new model as ReputationPro.\nHowever, in ReputationPro, the computation of reputation profile requires novel\nalgorithms for the precomputation of aggregates over large-scale ratings and\ntransaction data of three context dimensions as well as new data structures for\nappropriately indexing aggregation results to promptly answer buyers' CTT\nrequests. To solve these challenging problems, we then propose a new index\nscheme CMK-tree. After that, we further extend CMK-tree and propose a\nCMK-treeRS approach to reducing the storage space allocated to each seller.\nFinally, the experimental results illustrate that the CMK-tree is superior in\nefficiency for computing CTT values to all three existing approaches in the\nliterature. In addition, though with reduced storage space, the CMK-treeRS\napproach can further improve the performance in answering buyers' CTT queries.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to the loss of some\n  figures"]}]

We develop a statistical method for computing an intensity\nfunction, which measures how often the refrigeration system stays synchronized.\nBy analyzing the intensity, we conclude that the increase in measurement\nuncertainty yields the decrease at the prevalence of synchronization.\n","Comment: In Proceedings HAS 2014, arXiv:1501.05405"]}]

In doing so,\nRegressionFactory offers several advantages: 1) It provides a fast and\nconvenient method for constructing log-likelihood and its derivatives by\nrequiring only the low-dimensional, base-distribution derivatives, 2) The\naccompanying definiteness-invariance theorem allows researchers to reason about\nthe negative-definiteness of the log-likelihood Hessian in the much\nlower-dimensional space of the base distributions, 3) The factorized, abstract\nview of regression suggests opportunities to generate novel regression models,\nand 4) Computational techniques for performance optimization can be developed\ngenerically in the abstract framework and be readily applicable across all the\nspecific regression instances. We expect RegressionFactory to facilitate\nresearch and development on optimization and sampling techniques for GLM\nlog-likelihoods as well as construction of composite models from GLM lego\nblocks, such as Hierarchical Bayesian models.\n"]}]

Without further\nconstraints, BIPs are usually ill-posed. In practice, properties of natural\nsignals are exploited to solve BIPs. For example, subspace constraints or\nsparsity constraints are imposed to reduce the search space. These approaches\nhave shown some success in practice. However, there are few results on\nuniqueness in BIPs. For most BIPs, the fundamental question of under what\ncondition the problem admits a unique solution, is yet to be answered.

This\ndiscipline, while still young, exploits the spin of electrons. Most quantum\ndevices exploiting this property of electrons consists of alternating magnetic\nand nonmagnetic thin layers on a semiconductor substrate. One of the best tools\nused for characterizing these structures is the so-called Ballistic Electron\nEmission Microscope (BEEM). Originally, it was dedicated to the imaging of\nburied objects and to the study of the potential barrier formed at the\ninterface of a metal and a semiconductor. With the development of spintronics,\nthe BEEM became an essential spectroscopy technique but still fundamentally\nmisunderstood. The first realistic model, based on the non-equilibrium Keldysh\nformalism, was proposed to describe the transport of electrons during BEEM\nexperiments. However, despite its success, its use was limited to the study of\nsemi-infinite structures through a calculation method called decimation of\nGreen functions. In this context, we have extended this model to the case of\nthin films and hetero-structures like spinvalves: starting from the same\npostulate that electrons follow the band structure of materials in which they\npropagate, we have established an iterative formula allowing calculation of the\nGreen functions of the finite system by tight-binding method and encoded it in\na F90 code. In parallel, we have developed a simpler method which allows to\navoid passing through the non-equilibrium Keldysh formalism. Despite its\nsimplicity, we have shown that this intuitive approach gives some physical\ninterpretation qualitatively similar to the non-equilibrium approach. However,\nfor a more detailed study, the use of \"non-equilibrium approach\" is inevitable,\nespecially for the detection of thickness effects linked to layer interfaces.\n","Comment: 200 pages, Ph.D. thesis"]}]

Amongst\nthe common investigation methods deployed, we carried out three magnetotelluric\n(MT) surveys located above three of the most promising geothermal fields of\nMartinique, namely the Anses d'Arlet, the Montagne Pel{\\'e}e and the Pitons du\nCarbet prospects. A total of about 100 MT stations were acquired showing single\nor multi-dimensional behaviors and static shift effects. After processing data\nwith remote reference, 3-D MT inversions of the four complex elements of MT\nimpedance tensor without pre-static-shift correction, have been performed for\neach sector, providing three 3-D resistivity models down to about 12 to 30 km\ndepth. The sea coast effect has been taken into account in the 3-D inversion\nthrough generation of a 3-D resistivity model including the bathymetry around\nMartinique from the coast up to a distance of 200 km. The forward response of\nthe model is used to calculate coast effect coefficients that are applied to\nthe calculated MT response during the 3-D inversion process for comparison with\nthe observed data. 3-D resistivity models of each sector, which are inherited\nfrom different geological history, show 3-D resistivity distribution and\nspecificities related to its volcanological history. In particular, the\ngeothermal field related to the Montagne Pel{\\'e}e strato-volcano, is\ncharacterized by a quasi ubiquitous conductive layer and quite monotonic\ntypical resistivity distribution making interpretation difficult in terms of\ngeothermal targets. At the opposite, the resistivity distribution of Anse\nd'Arlet area is radically different and geothermal target is thought to be\nconnected to a not so deep resistive intrusion elongated along a main\nstructural axis. Beside these interesting deep structures, we demonstrate,\nafter analyzing the results of the recent heliborne TEM survey covering the\nwhole Martinique, that surface resistivity distribution obtained from 3-D\ninversion reproduce faithfully the resistivity distribution observed by TEM. In\nspite of a very different sampling scale, this comparison illustrates the\nability of 3-D MT inversion to take into account and reproduce static shift\neffects in the sub-surface resistivity distribution.\n","Comment: Wordl Geothermal Congress 2015, Apr 2015, Melbourne, Australia"]}]

Follow-up\nspectroscopy was performed at the VLT, Gemini and Keck telescopes to confirm\nthe nature of the supernovae and to measure their redshift. With this data set,\nwe have built a Hubble diagram extending to z=1, with all distance measurements\ninvolving at least two bands. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated making use\nof the multi-band photometry obtained at CFHT. Cosmological fits to this first\nyear SNLS Hubble diagram give the following results : Omega_M = 0.263 +/-\n0.042(stat) +/- 0.032(sys) for a flat LambdaCDM model; and w = -1.023 +/-\n0.090(stat) +/- 0.054(sys) for a flat cosmology with constant equation of state\nw when combined with the constraint from the recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nmeasurement of baryon acoustic oscillations.\n","Comment: (The SNLS Collaboration) 24 pages, 13 figures, Accepted in A&A.\n  Computer readable tables at http://snls.in2p3.fr/conf/papers/cosmo1/"]}]

Its efficiency is better than\n99%. The nominal accuracy for galaxy coordinates calculated with the Guide Star\nCatalog is about 6 arcseconds. The cross-identification with galaxies available\nin the Lyon-Meudon Extragalactic DAtabase (LEDA) allows a calibraton of the\nI-band photometry with the sample of Mathewson et Al. Thus, the catalog\ncontains total I-band magnitude, isophotal diameter, axis ratio, position angle\nand a rough estimate of the morphological type code for 20260 galaxies. The\ninternal completeness of this catalog reaches magnitude $I_{lim}=14.5$, with a\nphotometric accuracy of $\\sim 0.18m$. 25% of the Southern sky has been\nprocessed in this study.\n  This quick look analysis allows us to start a radio and spectrographic\nfollow-up long before the end of the survey.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 17 figures, to appear A&A Supl.

Although the quarks carry unit intrinsic\nelectric charge in this construction, anomaly cancellation constrains the\nLagrangian in such a way that the quarks' associated currents couple to the\nphoton with the usual 2/3 and 1/3 fractional electric charge associated with\nconventional quarks. The resulting model is identical to the Standard Model in\nthe $SU_C(3)$ sector: However, in the $U_{EW}(2)$ sector it is similar but not\nnecessarily equivalent. Off hand, the model appears to be phenomenologically\nequivalent to the conventional quark model in the electroweak sector for\nexperimental conditions that preclude observation of individual constituent\ncurrents. On the other hand, it is conceivable that detailed analyses for\nelectroweak reactions may reveal discrepancies with the Standard Model in high\nenergy and/or large momentum transfer reactions.\n  The possibility of quarks with integer electric charge strongly suggests the\nnotion that leptons and quarks are merely different manifestations of the same\nunderlying field. A speculative model is proposed in which a phase transition\nis assumed to occur between $SU_C(3)\\otimes U_{EM}(1)$ and $U_{EM}(1)$ regimes.\nThis immediately; explains the equality of lepton/quark generations and\nlepton/hadron electric charge, relates neutrino oscillations to quark flavor\nmixing, reduces the free parameters of the Standard Model, and renders the\nissue of quark confinement moot.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]
