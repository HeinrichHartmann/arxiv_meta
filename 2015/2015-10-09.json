Larger\nspins are subject to the influence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which\ndescribes the dependence of the magnetic moment's energy on the orientation of\nthe spin relative to its surrounding atomic environment. Here we demonstrate\nthe decisive role of magnetic anisotropy in the physics of Kondo screening. A\nscanning tunnelling microscope is used to simultaneously determine the\nmagnitude of the spin, the magnetic anisotropy and the Kondo properties of\nindividual magnetic atoms on a surface. We find that a Kondo resonance emerges\nfor large-spin atoms only when the magnetic anisotropy creates degenerate\nground-state levels that are connected by the spin flip of a screening\nelectron. The magnetic anisotropy also determines how the Kondo resonance\nevolves in a magnetic field: the resonance peak splits at rates that are\nstrongly direction dependent.

On the other hand, for Mn acceptors placed\non deeper layers below the surface, the acceptor hole wavefunction is more\ndelocalized and the corresponding LDOS is much more sensitive on the direction\nof the Mn magnetic moment. However the magnetic anisotropy energy for these\nmagnetic impurities is large (up to 15 meV), and a magnetic field of 10 T can\nhardly change the landscape and rotate the direction of the Mn magnetic moment\naway from its easy axis.

They showed that\nsome NP-complete properties such as Hamiltonicity can be decided in polynomial\ntime on digraphs of constant directed treewidth. Nevertheless, despite more\nthan one decade of intensive research, the list of hard combinatorial problems\nthat are known to be solvable in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of\nconstant directed treewidth has remained scarce. In this work we enrich this\nlist by providing for the first time an algorithmic metatheorem connecting the\nmonadic second order logic of graphs to directed treewidth. We show that most\nof the known positive algorithmic results for digraphs of constant directed\ntreewidth can be reformulated in terms of our metatheorem. Additionally, we\nshow how to use our metatheorem to provide polynomial time algorithms for two\nclasses of combinatorial problems that have not yet been studied in the context\nof directed width measures. More precisely, for each fixed $k,w \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$, we show how to count in polynomial time on digraphs of directed\ntreewidth $w$, the number of minimum spanning strong subgraphs that are the\nunion of $k$ directed paths, and the number of maximal subgraphs that are the\nunion of $k$ directed paths and satisfy a given minor closed property. To prove\nour metatheorem we devise two technical tools which we believe to be of\nindependent interest. First, we introduce the notion of tree-zig-zag number of\na digraph, a new directed width measure that is at most a constant times\ndirected treewidth. Second, we introduce the notion of $z$-saturated tree slice\nlanguage, a new formalism for the specification and manipulation of infinite\nsets of digraphs.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to Discrete Applied Mathematics"]}]

These `planetesimals' can then\nefficiently accrete leftover pebbles and directly form the cores of giant\nplanets. This model known as `pebble accretion', theoretically, can produce 10\nM$_\\oplus$ cores in only a few thousand years.

This method is generic, and can be applied to recover a variety of\nisotropy violating phenomena. Here, we illustrate the procedure by recovering\nthe subtle Doppler boost signal from simulated boosted CMB skies, which has\nbecome possible with the unprecedented full-sky sensitivity of PLANCK probe.\n","Comment: Submitted to Proceeding of 11th Rencontres du Vietnam on Cosmology -\n  50 years after CMB discovery, Quy Nhon, Vietnam (August 16-22, 2015)"]}]

Nevertheless, the respective\nlow-energy field theory action, in which, for reasons of gauge invariance, the\nonly dependence on the KR field is through its field strength, constitutes an\ninteresting model \\emph{per se}. In this context, the KR field strength also\nacts as a totally antisymmetric torsion field, while in four space-time\ndimensions is \\emph{dual} to an (KR) axion-like pseudoscalar field. In this\ncontext, we review here first the r\\^ole of quantum fluctuations of the KR\naxion on the generation of Majorana mass for neutrinos, via a mixing with\nordinary axions that may exist in the theory as providers of dark matter\ncandidates. Then we proceed to discuss the r\\^ole of constant in time (thus\nLorentz violating) KR torsion backgrounds, that may exist in the early Universe\nbut are completely negligible today, on inducing Leptogenesis by means of\n\\emph{tree-level} CP violating decays of Right Handed Massive Majorana\nneutrinos in the presence of such H-torsion backgrounds. Some speculations\nregarding microscopic D-brane world models, where such scenarios may be\nrealised, are also given.\n","Comment: 22 pages latex, uses special macros, Plenary talk at Planck 2015,\n  18th International Conference From the Planck Scale to the Electroweak Scale,\n  25-29 May 2015,Ioannina, Greece, to be published in the Proceedings (POS)"]}]
