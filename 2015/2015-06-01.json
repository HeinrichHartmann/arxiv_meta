A flux tube is assumed to lie initially near the top of the stably\nstratified radiative core below the convection zone, but a segment of it is\nperturbed into the convection zone by gradual heating and convective overshoot\nmotions. The ends (\"footpoints\") of the segment remain anchored at the base of\nthe convection zone, and if the segment is sufficiently long, it may be\nbuoyantly unstable, rising through the convection zone in a short time. The\nlength of the flux tube determines the ratio of buoyancy to magnetic tension:\nshort loops of flux are arrested before reaching the top of the convection\nzone, while longer loops emerge to erupt through the photosphere. Using\nSpruit's convection zone model, we compute the minimum footpoint separation\n$L_c$ required for erupting flux tubes. We explore the dependence of $L_c$ on\nthe initial thermal state of the perturbed flux tube segment and on its initial\nmagnetic field strength. Following an investigation of thermal diffusion time\nscales and the dynamic rise times of unstable flux tube segments, we conclude\nthat the most likely origin for magnetic flux which erupts to the surface is\nfrom short length scale perturbations ($L < L_c$) which are initially stable,\nbut which are subsequently destabilized either by diffusion of heat into the\ntube or by stretching of the anchor points until $L$ just exceeds $L_c$. In\neither case, the separation of the anchor points of the emergent tube should\nlie between the critical distance for a tube in mechanical equilibrium and one\nin thermal equilibrium.

Traditionally, it is\nassumed that the channel is noiseless. However, Maurer showed that in this case\nan attacker can succeed with probability $2^{-\\frac{H(K)}{\\ell+1}}$ after\nauthenticating $\\ell$ messages.

We regard the noisy channel as an expensive resource and\ndefine the authentication rate $\\rho_{auth}$ as the ratio of message length to\nthe number $n$ of channel $W_1$ uses.

The end result of the study is a parametrization for\nthis time, in order that it may be compared with timescales for various\ndisruptive effects to which clumps may be subject. An important effect is that\nas the clump compresses, it also compresses the gas due to drag. This increases\ngas pressure which retards particle collapse and leads to oscillation in the\nsize and density of the clump. The ratio of gravitational force to gas pressure\ngives a two-phase Jeans parameter, $J_t$, which is the classical Jeans\nparameter with the sound speed replaced by an the wave speed in a coupled\ntwo-fluid medium. Its use makes the results insensitive to the initial density\nratio of particles to gas as a separate parameter. An ordinary differential\nequation model is developed which takes the form of two coupled non-linear\noscillators and reproduces key features of the simulations. Finally, a\nparametric study of the time to collapse is performed and a formula (fit to the\nsimulations) is developed.

One of the few way to test this idea is to\nlook for evidence of the relic inhomogeneities left by the collisions between\nother bubbles and our own. Such relic inhomogeneities induces a coherent bulk\nflow over gigaparsec scales. Therefore, bubble collisions leave unique imprints\nin the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich\n(kSZ) effect, temperature anisotropies induced by the scattering of photons\nfrom coherently moving free electrons in the diffuse intergalactic medium. The\nkSZ signature produced by bubble collisions has a unique directional dependence\nand is tightly correlated with the galaxy distribution; it can therefore be\ndistinguished from other contributions to the CMB anisotropies. An important\nadvantage of the kSZ signature is that it peaks on arcminute angular scales,\nwhere the limiting factors in making a detection are instrumental noise and\nforeground subtraction. This is in contrast to the collision signature in the\nprimary CMB, which peaks on angular scales much larger than one degree, and\nwhose detection is therefore limited by cosmic variance. In this paper, we\nexamine the prospects for probing the inhomogeneities left by bubble collisions\nusing the kSZ effect. We provide a forecast for detection using\ncross-correlations between CMB and galaxy surveys, finding that the\ndetectability using the kSZ effect can be competitive with constraints from CMB\ntemperature and polarization data.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 17 figures.

That metric\nansatz somewhat resembles to the famous Kerr-Schild (KS) form, but it is\ndifferent from the KS one in two distinct aspects. That is, apart from a global\nconformal factor, the metric ansatz can be written as a vacuum background\nspacetime plus a \"perturbation\" modification term, the latter of which is\nassociated with a timelike geodesic vector field rather than a null geodesic\ncongruence in the usual KS ansatz. In this paper, we shall study this novel\nmetric ansatz in detail, aiming at achieving some inspiration as to the\nconstruction of rotating charged AdS black holes with multiple charges in other\ngauged supergravity theories. In order to investigate the metric properties of\nthe general KK-AdS solutions, in this paper we devise a new effective method,\ndubbed the background metric expansion method, which can be thought of as a\ngeneralization of the perturbation expansion method, to deal with the\nLagrangian and all equations of motion. In addition to two previously known\nconditions, namely the timelike and geodesic properties of the vector, we get\nthe three additional constraints via contracting the Maxwell and Einstein\nequations once or twice with this timelike geodesic vector.

The advantages of MCMP are threefold: (i) asymptotic\ncorrectness of CP estimation, as opposed to most current approximations, which,\nas shown in this paper, can be off by large multiples and hinder the\ncomputation of feasible plans; (ii) speed and parallelizability, and (iii)\ngenerality, i.e., the approach is applicable to virtually any planning problem\nprovided that a path tracking controller and a notion of distance to obstacles\nin the configuration space are available. Numerical results illustrate the\ncorrectness (in terms of feasibility), efficiency (in terms of path cost), and\ncomputational speed of MCMP.\n"]}]

Tissue fibrosis is a typical aging change,\nand it is the main cause for diseases such as essential arterial hypertension,\nbenign prostatic hyperplasia and senile chronic bronchitis/emphysema. Fibrosis\nis known to be a result of repairs of a tissue with collagen fibers. In our\nMisrepair-accumulation aging theory, we proposed a generalized concept of\nMisrepair, which is defined as incorrect reconstruction of an injured living\nstructure. Thus a repair with collagen fibers for replacing dead cells or\ninjured extracellular matrixes is a kind of Misrepair. Progressive process of\nfibrosis in an organism demonstrates that: A. a process of Misrepair exists; B.\nMisrepairs are unavoidable; and C. Misrepairs accumulate. Thus, the phenomenon\nof fibrosis is a principle evidence for demonstrating the central role of\nMisrepair in aging. Accumulation of collagen fibers in a tissue is focalized\nand inhomogeneous, resulting in the development of bands of hyaline\ndegeneration. In arteriosclerotic hypertension and in chronic\nbronchitis/emphysema, the deposed collagen fibers in arterial walls and airway\nwalls are used for replacing the broken elastic fibers and myofibers, which are\ninjured during repeated deformations of the walls. Stiffness of arterial walls\npromotes enlargement of myofibers, leading to thickness of the walls. In Benign\nprostatic hyperplasia, the deposed collagen fibers in muscular tissues are used\nfor replacing broken myofibers, which are injured during ejaculations. Muscular\nfibrosis results in accumulation of prostatic fluid and expansion of the\nprostate. Apart from these diseases, scar formation and wrinkle formation are a\npart of fibrosis of the skin, and senile hair-loss and hair-whitening are\nresults of dermal fibrosis.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Belief function theories\n(e.g., Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, Transferable Belief Model) have been\nshown to provide a reasonable methodology for processing or fusing the\nquantitative clues or information measurements that form the incomplete\ninformation set. For decision making, the pignistic (from the Latin pignus, a\nbet) probability transform has been shown to be a good method of using Beliefs\nor basic belief assignments (BBAs) to make decisions. For many systems, one\nneed only address the most-probable elements in the set. For some critical\nsystems, one must evaluate the risk of wrong decisions and establish safe\nprobability thresholds for decision making. This adds a greater complexity to\ndecision making, since one must address all elements in the set that are above\nthe risk decision threshold. The problem is greatly simplified if most of the\nprobabilities fall below this threshold. Finding a probability transform that\nproperly represents mixes of low- and high-probability events is essential.\nThis article introduces four new pignistic probability transforms with an\nimplementation that uses the latest values of Beliefs, Plausibilities, or BBAs\nto improve the pignistic probability estimates. Some of them assign smaller\nvalues of probabilities for smaller values of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets\npignistic transform. They also assign higher probability values for larger\nvalues of Beliefs or BBAs than the Smets pignistic transform. These probability\ntransforms will assign a value of probability that converges faster to the\nvalues below the risk threshold. A probability information content (PIC)\nvariable is also introduced that assigns an information content value to any\nset of probability. Four operators are defined to help simplify the\nderivations.\n","Comment: 7 pages, International Society of Information Fusion Conference\n  Proceedings Fusion 2001 at Montreal, Quebec, Canada"]}]

In a previous paper, we demonstrated that flybys --\nan interaction where two independent halos inter-penetrate but detach at a\nlater time and do not merge -- occur much more frequently than previously\nbelieved. In particular, we found that the frequency of flybys increases at low\nredshift and is comparable to or even greater than the frequency of mergers for\nhalos $\\gtrsim 10^{11} M_\\odot/h$. In this paper, we classify flybys according\nto their orbits and the level of perturbation exacted on both the halos\ninvolved.

The typical flyby mass-ratio is $\\sim 0.1$ at high $z$\nfor all halos, while at low $z$, massive primary halos undergo flybys with\nsmall secondary halos. We estimate the perturbation from the flyby on both the\nprimary and the secondary and find that a typical flyby is mostly\nnon-perturbative for the primary halo. However, since a massive primary\nexperiences so many flybys at any given time, they are nearly continually a\nvictim of a perturbative event.

We first show how this mental effort\n(a.k.a., mental workload) can be estimated from such signals, and then measure\nit on 8 participants during an actual 3D object manipulation task with an input\ndevice known as the CubTile. Our results suggest that monitoring workload\nenables us to continuously assess the 3DUI and/or interaction technique\nease-of-use. Overall, this suggests that this new measure could become a useful\naddition to the repertoire of available evaluation tools, enabling a finer\ngrain assessment of the ergonomic qualities of a given 3D user interface.\n","Comment: Published in INTERACT, Sep 2015, Bamberg, Germany"]}]

In the weak\nfield regime magnetic properties such as magnetizabilities and NMR shielding\nconstants show modest but systematic improvements over GGA functionals.\nHowever, in strong field regime the mGGA based forms lead to a significantly\nimproved description of the recently proposed perpendicular paramagnetic\nbonding mechanism, comparing well with CCSD(T) data. In contrast to functionals\nbased on the vorticity these forms are found to be numerically stable and their\naccuracy at high field suggests the extension of mGGAs to CDFT via the\ngeneralized kinetic energy density should provide a useful starting point for\nfurther development of CDFT approximations.\n"]}]

In particular, a high number of categories per variable, a high number of\nvariables or a small the number of individuals are not an issue for MIMCA.\nThrough a simulation study based on real data sets, the method is assessed and\ncompared to the reference methods (multiple imputation using the loglinear\nmodel, multiple imputation by logistic regressions) as well to the latest works\non the topic (multiple imputation by random forests or by the Dirichlet process\nmixture of products of multinomial distributions model). The proposed method\nshows good performances in terms of bias and coverage for an analysis model\nsuch as a main effects logistic regression model. In addition, MIMCA has the\ngreat advantage that it is substantially less time consuming on data sets of\nhigh dimensions than the other multiple imputation methods.\n"]}]

Applied to 168 samples of\nwhole-genome sequence data from northern Ghana, the model provides\nsignificantly improvement fit over models implementing simpler approaches to\nmixture for a large majority (129/168) of samples. We discuss the possible uses\nof this model as a window into within-host selection for clinical and\nepidemiological studies and outline possible means for experimental validation.\n"]}]
