The coupling consistently includes\nexcess (positive or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the\ndisplaced fluid, and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum\nequation. The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip\nconstraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the fluid\nvelocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that the\nformulation obeys a fluctuation-dissipation balance, owing to the\nnon-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a spatio-temporal\ndiscretization that preserves, as best as possible, these properties of the\ncontinuum formulation. In the spatial discretization, the local averaging and\nspreading operations are accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in\nimmersed boundary methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels\nmake the discrete blob a particle with surprisingly physically-consistent\nvolume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties. We develop a second-order\nsemi-implicit temporal integrator that maintains discrete\nfluctuation-dissipation balance, and is not limited in stability by viscosity.\nFurthermore, the temporal scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and\nHelmholtz linear solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based\nimplementation on GPUs.

We propose that the reason behind this\nremarkable property is the loss of causal connectivity across these jets,\ncaused by their rapid expansion in response to fast decline of external\npressure with the distance from the \"jet engine\". In atmospheres with power-law\npressure distribution, the total loss of causal connectivity occurs, when the\npower index k>2 - the steepness which is expected to be quite common for many\nastrophysical environments. This conclusion does not seem to depend on the\nphysical nature of jets - it applies both to relativistic and non-relativistic\nflows, both magnetically-dominated and unmagnetized jets. In order to verify\nit, we have carried out numerical simulations of moderately magnetized and\nmoderately relativistic jets. Their results give strong support to our\nhypothesis and provide with valuable insights. In particular, we find that the\nz-pinched inner cores of magnetic jets expand slower than their envelopes and\nbecome susceptible to instabilities even when the whole jet is stable. This may\nresult in local dissipation and emission without global disintegration of the\nflow. Cosmic jets may become globally unstable when they enter flat sections of\nexternal atmospheres. We propose that the Fanaroff-Riley morphological division\nof extragalactic radio sources into two classes is related to this issue.

Using both methods, we re-analyse the blazar sample of\nZamaninasab et al.

We determine the jet magnetic flux taking\ninto account this effect. We find that the transverse-averaged jet magnetic\nflux is fully compatible with the model of jet formation due to BH spin energy\nextraction and the accretion being a magnetically arrested disc (MAD). We\ncalculate the jet average mass-flow rate corresponding to this model and find\nit consists of a substantial fraction of the mass accretion rate. This suggests\nthe jet composition with a large fraction of baryons. We also calculate the\naverage jet power, and find it moderately exceeds the accretion power, $\\dot M\nc^2$, reflecting BH spin energy extraction.

ZVI is\nrobust and requires no special tuning of boundary conditions, or initial radial\nentropy or vortensity gradients (though we have studied ZVI only in the limit\nof infinite cooling time). The resolution of this paradox is that stable\nstratification allows for a new avenue to instability: baroclinic critical\nlayers.

The equilibrium model, which is broadly valid for\nstar-forming central galaxies that dominate cosmic star formation, is based on\nthe ansatz that galaxies live in a slowly-evolving equilibrium between inflows,\noutflows, and star formation. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain\napproach, we constrain our model to match observed galaxy scaling relations\nbetween stellar mass and halo mass, star formation rate, and metallicity from\n0<z<2. A good fit (chi^2~1.6) is achieved with eight free parameters. We\nfurther show that constraining our model to any two of the three data sets also\nproduces a fit to the third that is within reasonable systematic uncertainties.\nThe resulting best-fit parameters that describe baryon cycling suggest galactic\noutflow scalings intermediate between energy and momentum-driven winds, a weak\ndependence of wind recycling time on mass, and a quenching mass scale that\nevolves modestly upwards with redshift. This model further predicts a stellar\nmass-star formation rate relation that is in good agreement with observations\nto z~6.

It occurs as a result of the temporal\ncoherence of particles on the 3:-2 resonant orbits, which causes them to arrive\nsimultaneously at pericentre or apocentre. This resonant clumping, due to the\nin-phase motion of the particles through their epicycle, leads to both inward\nand outward moving groups which belong to the same orbital family and\nconsequently produce bimodal radial velocity distributions. This is a possible\nexplanation of the bimodal velocity distributions observed towards the Galactic\nanti-Centre by Liu et al. (2012).

In this paper, we study how LRGs\noccupy massive halos via direct counts in clusters and we reveal several\nunexpected trends suggesting that the connection between LRGs and dark matter\nhalos may not be straightforward. Using the redMaPPer cluster catalog, we\nderive the central occupation of LRGs as a function richness, Ncen({\\lambda}).\nAssuming no correlation between cluster mass and central galaxy luminosity at\nfixed richness, we show that clusters contain a significantly lower fraction of\ncentral LRGs than predicted from the two-point correlation function. At halo\nmasses of 10^14.5 Msun, we find Ncen=0.73, compared to Ncen of 0.89 from\ncorrelation studies. Our central occupation function for LRGs converges to 0.95\nat large halo masses. A strong anti-correlation between central luminosity and\ncluster mass at fixed richness is required to reconcile our results with those\nbased on clustering studies. We also derive P_BNC, the probability that the\nbrightest cluster member is not the central galaxy. We find P_BNC ~ 20-30%\nwhich is a factor of ~2 lower than the value found by Skibba et al. 2011.\nFinally, we study the radial offsets of bright non-central LRGs from cluster\ncenters and show that bright non-central LRGs follow a different radial\ndistribution compared to red cluster members, which follow a\nNavarro-Frank-White profile. This work demonstrates that even the most massive\nclusters do not always have an LRG at the center, and that the brightest galaxy\nin a cluster is not always the central galaxy.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, submitted to MNRAS, included the\n  referee comments"]}]

If this\ndensity profile extends in towards the SMBH, the mass accretion rate onto the\nSMBH could be at least two orders of magnitude less than the Bondi rate, which\nagrees with Faraday rotation measurements for M87. We discuss the evidence for\noutflow from the hot gas and the cold gas disk and for cold feedback, where gas\ncooling rapidly from the hot atmosphere could feed the cirumnuclear disk and\nfuel the SMBH. At 0.2 kpc radius, the cooler X-ray temperature component\nrepresents ~20% of the total X-ray gas mass and, by losing angular momentum to\nthe hot gas component, could provide a fuel source of cold clouds within the\nBondi radius.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by MNRAS"]}]

The template fit method also provides spectral\nclassification to half a subtype, classifies the stars along the dwarf-subdwarf\nmetallicity sequence, and provides improved metallicity/gravity information on\na finer scale. The automated search and classification is performed using a set\nof cool star templates assembled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nspectroscopic database. We show that the stars can be efficiently classified\ndespite shortcomings in the LAMOST commissioning data which include bright sky\nlines in the red. In particular we find that the absolute and relative\nstrengths of the critical TiO and CaH molecular bands around 7000A are cleanly\nmeasured, which provides accurate spectral typing from late-K to mid-M, and\nmakes it possible to estimate metallicities in a way that is more efficient and\nreliable than with the use of spectral indices or spectral-index based\nparameters such as zeta. Most of the cool dwarfs observed by LAMOST are found\nto be metal-rich dwarfs. We use a calibration of spectral type to absolute\nmagnitude and estimate spectroscopic distances for all the stars; we also\nrecover proper motions from the SUPERBLINK and PPMXL catalogs. Our analysis of\nthe estimated transverse motions suggests a mean velocity and standard\ndeviation for the UVW components of velocity to be: U=-9.8 km/s; V=-22.8 km/s;\nW=-7.9 km/s. The resulting values are general agreement with previous reported\nresults, which yields confidence in our spectral classification and\nspectroscopic distance estimates, and illustrates the potential for using\nLAMOST spectra of K and M dwarfs for investigating the chemo-kinematics of the\nlocal Galactic disk and halo.\n","Comment: 18 pages,16 figures,accepted for publication AJ"]}]

We have found that: 1) the antitruncated discs of all galaxy\ntypes from Sa to Scd obey tight scaling relations both in R and 3.6 microns, as\nobserved in S0s; 2) the majority of these correlations are significant\naccounting for the numbers of the available data samples; 3) the trends are\nclearly linear when the characteristic scalelengths are plotted on a\nlogarithmic scale; and 4) the correlations relating the characteristic surface\nbrightnesses of the inner and outer discs and the breaks with the various\ncharacteristic scalelengths significantly improve when the latter are\nnormalized to the optical radius of the galaxy. The results suggest that the\nscaling relations of Type-III discs are independent of the morphological type\nand the presence (or absence) of bars within the observational uncertainties of\nthe available datasets, although larger and deeper samples are required to\nconfirm this. The tight structural coupling implied by these scaling relations\nimpose strong constraints on the mechanisms proposed for explaining the\nformation of antitruncated stellar discs in the galaxies across the whole\nHubble Sequence (Abridged).\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 18 pages, 12\n  figures, 7 tables"]}]

This effect is well-known in\nthe oceanographic context, and is attributed to the excitation of the so-called\n\"collective instability\". In this work, we build on the results of Brown et al.\n(2013) and of Traxler et al. (2011b) to determine the conditions under which\nthe collective instability may be expected. We find that it is only relevant in\nstellar regions which have a relatively large Prandtl number (the ratio of the\nkinematic viscosity to the thermal diffusivity), $O(10^{-3})$ or larger. This\nimplies that the collective instability cannot occur in main sequence stars,\nwhere the Prandtl number is always much smaller than this (except in the outer\nlayers of surface convection zones where fingering is irrelevant anyway). It\ncould in principle be excited in regions of high electron degeneracy, during He\ncore flash, or in the interiors of white dwarfs. We discuss the implications of\nour findings for these objects, both from a theoretical and from an\nobservational point of view.\n","Comment: To be published in ApJ"]}]

The model reveals the following implications of star formation\nand feedback processes in galaxy formation. First, the observed metallicity\nrelations provide a stringent upper limit for the averaged outflow mass-loading\nfactors of local galaxies, which is ~20 for M_*~10^9Msun galaxies and\nmonotonically decreases to ~1 for M_*~10^{11}Msun galaxies. Second, the\ninferred upper-limit for the outflow mass-loading factor sensitively depends on\nwhether the outflow is metal-enriched with respect to the ISM metallicity. If\nhalf of the metals ejected from SNe leave the galaxy in metal-enriched winds,\nthe outflow mass-loading factor for galaxies at any mass can barely be higher\nthan ~10, which puts strong constraints on galaxy formation models. Third, the\nrelatively lower stellar-phase to gas-phase metallicity ratio for lower-mass\ngalaxies indicate that low-mass galaxies are still rapidly enriching their\nmetallicities in recent times, while high-mass galaxies are more settled, which\nseems to show a downsizing effect in the metallicity evolution of galaxies.

Whether such a dependence\nexists at higher redshifts, and whether the resulting M-Z-SFR relation is\nredshift invariant, is debated. We re-examine these issues by applying the\nnon-parametric techniques of Salim et al. (2014) to ~130 $z\\sim2.3$ galaxies\nwith N2 and O3 measurements from KBSS (Steidel et al. 2014).

While major mergers likely drive this enhanced efficiency in some\nstarbursts, the lowest mass starbursts may experience periodic bursts,\nconsistent with enhanced scatter in t_dep at low M*. Two starbursts appear to\nbe pre-coalescence mergers; their elevated MHI/M* suggest that HI-to-H2\nconversion is still ongoing at this stage. By comparing with the GASS sample,\nwe find that t_dep anti-correlates with stellar surface density for disks,\nwhile spheroids show no such trend.

The new code, called \"rVINE\", aims to\nsignificantly improve the accuracy of close encounters of massive bodies with\nsupermassive black holes in galaxy-scale numerical simulations. We demonstrate\nthe capabilities of the code by studying two test problems, the sinking of a\nsingle massive black hole to the centre of a gas-free galaxy due to dynamical\nfriction and the hardening of a supermassive black hole binary due to close\nstellar encounters. We show that results obtained with rVINE compare well with\nNBODY7 for problems with particle numbers that can be simulated with NBODY7. In\nparticular, in both NBODY7 and rVINE we find a clear N-dependence of the binary\nhardening rate, a low binary eccentricity and moderate eccentricity evolution,\nas well as the conversion of the galaxy's inner density profile from a cusp to\na a core via the ejection of stars at high velocity. The much larger number of\nparticles that can be handled by rVINE will open up exciting opportunities to\nmodel stellar dynamics close to SMBHs much more accurately in a realistic\ngalactic context.

Our results suggest that star formation on galactic\nscales is dramatically affected by central dense structures through both\nenhancing and/or quenching processes; while lower-mass SFGs tend to have less\nbursty star formation histories. However, the dispersion of SSFR becomes\nsignificantly smaller and remains constant when only disk-dominated SFGs are\ncounted.

Using\nquasiclassical Green's function method, we show that the magnetization becomes\nfinite inside N. The origin of this magnetization is due to odd-frequency\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs formed by electrons of equal and opposite spins,\nwhich are induced by proximity effect in the S/F1/N/F2/S junction. We find that\nthe magnetization M(d,q) in N can be decomposed into two parts,\nM(d,q)=MI(d)+MII(d,q), where q is the superconducting phase difference between\ntwo Ss and d is the thickness of N. MI(d) exists generally in S/F junctions,\nwhile MII(d,q) carries all q dependence and represents the fingerprint of phase\ncoherence between two Ss in Josephson junctions. The q dependence thus allows\nus to control the magnetization in N by tuning q for a fixed d. We show that\nMI(d) weakly decreases with increasing d, while the q dependent magnetization\nMII(d,q) rapidly decays with d. Moreover, we find that the time-averaged\nmagnetization <MII(d,q)> exhibits discontinuous peak at each resonance DC\nvoltage Vn=nhw_S/2e(n: integer) when DC voltage V as well as AC voltage v_ac(t)\nwith frequency w_S are both applied to the S/F1/N/F2/S junction.

We also discuss that\nthe magnetization induced in N can be measurably large in realistic systems.\nTherefore, the measurement of the induced magnetization serves as an\nalternative way to detect the phase coherence between two Ss in Josephson\njunctions.

The technique works over a very\nlarge wavelength range, is free from fundamental read noise and dark-current\nlimitations, and provides microsecond-level timing resolution. Since the\ninstrument reads out all pixels continuously while exposing, there is no loss\nof active exposure time to readout. The technology requires a different\napproach to data reduction compared to conventional CCDs. We outline here the\nprototype data reduction pipeline developed for ARCONS, though many of the\nprinciples are also more broadly applicable to energy-resolved photon counting\narrays (e.g., transition edge sensors, superconducting tunnel junctions). We\ndescribe the pipeline's current status, and the algorithms and techniques\nemployed in taking data from the arrival of photons at the MKID array to the\nproduction of images, spectra, and time-resolved light curves.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 19 figures, pdflatex, accepted for ApJS"]}]

The LMC\nsample is an extension of the OGLE-III Catalog of ACs published in 2008, while\nthe SMC sample contains the first known bona fide ACs in this galaxy. The total\nsample is composed of 141 ACs in the LMC and 109 ACs in the SMC. All these\nstars pulsate in single modes: fundamental (174 objects) or first overtone (76\nobjects). Additionally, we report the discovery of four ACs located in the\nforeground of the Magellanic Clouds. These are the first fundamental-mode ACs\nknown in the Galactic field.\n  We demonstrate that the coefficients phi_21 and phi_31 determined by the\nFourier light curve decomposition are useful discriminators between classical\nCepheids and ACs, at least in the LMC and in the field of the Milky Way. In the\nSMC, the light curve shapes and mean magnitudes of short-period classical\nCepheids make them similar to ACs, which is a source of difficulties in the\ndiscrimination of both classes of pulsators. The presence of unidentified ACs\nin the catalogs of classical Cepheids may be partly responsible for the\nobserved non-linearity of the period-luminosity relation observed for\nshort-period Cepheids in the SMC. We compare spatial distributions of ACs,\nclassical Cepheids and RR Lyr stars. We show that the distribution of ACs\nresembles that of old stars (RR Lyr variables), although in the LMC there are\nvisible structures typical for young population (classical Cepheids): the bar\nand spiral arms.

It is found that hydrogen bonding, van der Waals\ninteractions and steric repulsions all contribute in shaping how BTAH molecules\nadsorb, with flat-lying structures preferred at low coverage and upright\nconfigurations preferred at high coverage. The interaction of the\ndehydrogenated benzotriazole molecule (BTA) with the copper surface is instead\ndominated by strong chemisorption via the azole moiety with the aid of copper\nadatoms. Structures of dimers or chains are found to be the most stable\nstructures at all coverages, in good agreement with scanning tunnelling\nmicroscopy results. Benzotriazole thus shows a complex phase behaviour in which\nvan der Waals forces play an important role and which depends on coverage and\non its protonation state and all of these factors feasibly contribute to its\neffectiveness as a corrosion inhibitor.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 7 figures"]}]

First, structure formation requires slight inhomogeneities in the\ndensity of matter in the early universe, which then get amplified by the effect\nof gravity, leading to clumping of matter into stars and galaxies. According to\ninflation theory, quantum fluctuations form the seeds of these inhomogeneities.\nHowever, these quantum fluctuations are described by a quantum state which is\nhomogeneous and isotropic, and this raises a problem, connected to the\nfoundations of quantum theory, as the unitary evolution alone cannot break the\nsymmetry of the quantum state.

By unpredictable we mean\nsomething stronger than the spread of probabilities over given possible\noutcomes, namely an opening to unforeseeable possibilities. Unpredictability,\nuntil now overlooked in theoretical physics, makes the transmission of numbers\ninteresting.

These mechanisms include coannihilation\nwith some nearly-degenerate next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP)\nsuch as the lighter stau (stau_1), stop (stop_1) or chargino (chargino_1),\nresonant annihilation via direct-channel heavy Higgs bosons H/A, the light\nHiggs boson h or the Z boson, and enhanced annihilation via a larger Higgsino\ncomponent of the LSP in the focus-point region. These mechanisms typically\nselect lower-dimensional subspaces in MSSM scenarios such as the CMSSM, NUHM1,\nNUHM2 and pMSSM10. We analyze how future LHC and direct DM searches can\ncomplement each other in the exploration of the different DM mechanisms within\nthese scenarios. We find that the stau_1 coannihilation regions of the CMSSM,\nNUHM1, NUHM2 can largely be explored at the LHC via searches for missing E_T\nevents and long-lived charged particles, whereas their H/A funnel, focus-point\nand chargino_1 coannihilation regions can largely be explored by the LZ and\nDarwin DM direct detection experiments. We find that the dominant DM mechanism\nin our pMSSM10 analysis is chargino_1 coannihilation: {parts of its parameter\nspace can be explored by the LHC, and a larger portion by future direct DM\nsearches.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 8 figures"]}]
