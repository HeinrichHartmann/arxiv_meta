ARC is a 200-250\nMWe tokamak reactor with a major radius of 3.3 m, a minor radius of 1.1 m, and\nan on-axis magnetic field of 9.2 T. ARC has rare earth barium copper oxide\n(REBCO) superconducting toroidal field coils, which have joints to enable\ndisassembly. This allows the vacuum vessel to be replaced quickly, mitigating\nfirst wall survivability concerns, and permits a single device to test many\nvacuum vessel designs and divertor materials. The design point has a plasma\nfusion gain of Q_p~13.6, yet is fully non-inductive, with a modest bootstrap\nfraction of only ~63%. Thus ARC offers a high power gain with relatively large\nexternal control of the current profile. This highly attractive combination is\nenabled by the ~23 T peak field on coil with newly available REBCO\nsuperconductor technology. External current drive is provided by two innovative\ninboard RF launchers using 25 MW of lower hybrid and 13.6 MW of ion cyclotron\nfast wave power. The resulting efficient current drive provides a robust,\nsteady state core plasma far from disruptive limits.

As an initial example of such a study,\nthe recipe in (Green & Wald, 2012) for going between N-body results and a\nperturbed FLRW metric in the Newtonian gauge is used to study light propagation\nthrough quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The study is conducted by deriving a\nset of ODEs giving an expression for the angular diameter distance in the\nNewtonian gauge metric. The accuracy of the results obtained from the ODEs is\nestimated by using the ODEs to determine the distance-redshift relation in mock\nN-body data based on quasi-spherical Szekeres models. The results are then\ncompared to the exact relations. From this comparison it is seen that the\nobtained ODEs can accurately reproduce the distance-redshift relation along\nboth radial and non-radial geodesics in spherically symmetric models. The\nreproduction of geodesics in non-symmetric Szekeres models is slightly less\naccurate, but still good. These results indicate that the employment of\nperturbed FLRW metrics for standard ray tracing techniques yields fairly\naccurate results, at least regarding distance-redshift relations.

One\nprediction of the models is that some afterglow temporal breaks at different\nenergy bands should be achromatic. Observations in the Swift era have revealed\nchromatic afterglow behaviors at least in some GRBs, casting doubts on the EFS\norigin of GRB afterglows. In this paper, we perform a systematic study to\naddress the question: how bad/good are the external forward shock models? Our\nsample includes 85 GRBs well-monitored X-ray and optical lightcurves. Based on\nhow well the data abide by the EFS models, we categorize them as: Gold sample:\n(Grade I and II) include 45/85 GRBs. They show evidence of, or are consistent\nwith having, an achromatic break. The temporal/spectral behaviors in each\nafterglow segment are consistent with the predictions (closure relations) of\nthe EFS models. Silver sample: (Grade III and IV) include 37/85 GRBs. They are\nalso consistent with having an achromatic break, even though one or more\nafterglow segments do not comply with the closure relations. Bad sample: (Grade\nV), 3/85 shows direct evidence of chromatic behaviors, suggesting that the EFS\nmodels are inconsistent with the data. These are included in the Bad sample. We\nfurther perform statistical analyses of various observational properties\n($\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $t_b$ and model parameters (energy injection index q, p,\n$\\theta_j$, $\\eta_\\gamma$, etc) of the GRBs in the Gold Sample, and derive\nconstraints on the magnetization parameter $\\epsilon_B$ in the EFS. Overall, we\nconclude that the simplest EFS models can account for the multi-wavelength\nafterglow data of at least half of the GRBs. When more advanced modeling (e.g.,\nlong-lasting reverse shock, structured jets) is invoked, up to $>90 \\%$ of the\nafterglows may be interpreted within the framework of the ESF models.\n","Comment: 69 pages,134 figures, 7 tables, ApJS, in press"]}]

The fully dynamic version, in which edges are inserted\nand deleted over time has also been the subject of much attention. Existing\nalgorithms for dynamic matching (in general graphs) seem to fall into two\ngroups: there are fast (mostly randomized) algorithms that do not achieve a\nbetter than 2-approximation, and there slow algorithms with $\\O(\\sqrt{m})$\nupdate time that achieve a better-than-2 approximation. Thus the obvious\nquestion is whether we can design an algorithm -- deterministic or randomized\n-- that achieves a tradeoff between these two: a $o(\\sqrt{m})$ approximation\nand a better-than-2 approximation simultaneously. We answer this question in\nthe affirmative for bipartite graphs.\n  Our main result is a fully dynamic algorithm that maintains a $3/2 + \\eps$\napproximation in worst-case update time $O(m^{1/4}\\eps^{/2.5})$. We also give\nstronger results for graphs whose arboricity is at most $\\al$, achieving a $(1+\n\\eps)$ approximation in worst-case time $O(\\al (\\al + \\log n))$ for constant\n$\\eps$. When the arboricity is constant, this bound is $O(\\log n)$ and when the\narboricity is polylogarithmic the update time is also polylogarithmic.\n  The most important technical developement is the use of an intermediate graph\nwe call an edge degree constrained subgraph (EDCS). This graph places\nconstraints on the sum of the degrees of the endpoints of each edge: upper\nbounds for matched edges and lower bounds for unmatched edges. The main\ntechnical content of our paper involves showing both how to maintain an EDCS\ndynamically and that and EDCS always contains a sufficiently large matching.

As\nmight be expected, the stochastic upper bounds are larger than the\ndeterministic counterpart of \\citet{Doering15}, but their variation with noise\namplitude exhibits interesting behavior. Below the transition to chaotic\ndynamics the upper bounds increase monotonically with noise amplitude. However,\nin the chaotic regime this monotonicity depends on the number of realizations\nin the ensemble; at a particular Rayleigh number the bound may increase or\ndecrease with noise amplitude. The origin of this behavior is the coupling\nbetween the noise and unstable periodic orbits, the degree of which depends on\nthe degree to which the ensemble represents the ergodic set. This is confirmed\nby examining the close returns plots of the full solutions to the stochastic\nequations and the numerical convergence of the noise correlations. The\nnumerical convergence of both the ensemble and time averages of the noise\ncorrelations is sufficiently slow that it is the limiting aspect of the\nrealization of these bounds.

The main stake in this field is to find accurate and quick\nalgorithms to compute the similarity in short times. This will be achieved in\nusing approximation methods. The first approximation method is statistical and,\nis based on the theorem of Glivenko-Cantelli. The second is the banding\ntechnique. And the third concerns a modification of the algorithm proposed by\nRajaraman and al (% \\cite{AnandJeffrey}), denoted here as (RUM). The Jaccard\nindex is the one used in this paper.

The measurements were performed on composites for\ntwo distinct regimes of fractional filling: monolayer coverage at the pore\nwalls and complete filling of the pores. For the layer coverage a slow surface\nrelaxation dominates the dielectric properties. For the entirely filled\nchannels the dielectric spectra are governed by two thermally-activated\nrelaxation processes with considerably different relaxation rates: A slow\nrelaxation in the interface layer next to the channel walls and a fast\nrelaxation in the core region of the channel filling. The strengths and\ncharacteristic frequencies of both relaxation processes have been extracted and\nanalysed as a function of temperature. Whereas the temperature dependence of\nthe static capacitance reflects the effective (average) molecular ordering over\nthe pore volume and is well described within a Landau-de Gennes theory, the\nextracted relaxation strengths of the slow and fast relaxation processes\nprovide an access to distinct local molecular ordering mechanisms. The order\nparameter in the core region exhibits a bulk-like behaviour with a strong\nincrease in the nematic ordering just below the paranematic-to-nematic\ntransition temperature T_PN and subsequent saturation during cooling. By\ncontrast, the surface ordering evolves continuously with a kink near T_PN. A\ncomparison of the thermotropic behaviour of the monolayer with the complete\nfilling reveals that the molecular order in the core region of the pore filling\naffects the order of the peripheral molecular layers at the wall.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The device and the method are based on an electromagnetic-mechanical\npulser (EMMP) that consists of a series of transverse deflecting cavities and\nmagnetic quadrupoles. The EMMP modulates and chops the incoming dc electron\nbeam and converts it into pico- and sub-pico-second (100 fs to 10 ps) electron\npulse sequences at >1 GHz repetition rates. Applying the EMMP to a transmission\nelectron microscope (TEM) with any dc electron source, a GHz stroboscopic\nhigh-duty-cycle TEM can be realized. Unlike in many recent developments in\ntime-resolved TEM that rely on a sample pumping laser paired with a laser\nlaunching electrons from a photocathode to probe the sample, there is no laser\nin the presented experimental set-up. This is expected to be a significant\nrelief for electron microscopists who are not familiar with laser systems. The\nEMMP and the sample are externally driven by a radiofrequency (RF) source\nsynchronized through a delay line. With no laser pumping the sample, the\nproblem of the laser induced residual heating/damaging the sample is\neliminated. As many RF-driven processes can be cycled indefinitely, sampling\nrates of 1-50 GHz become accessible. Such a GHz stroboscopic TEM would open up\na new paradigm for in situ and in operando experiments to study samples\nexternally driven electromagnetically. Complementary to the lower (MHz)\nrepetition rates experiments enabled by laser photocathode TEM, new experiments\nin the high rep-rate multi-GHz regime will be enabled by the proposed RF\ndesign.

Its\nmeasurement, especially for the case of antiferromagnetic ordering, however, is\ngenerally difficult to be achieved. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of\nmagnetic ordering detection using a noncontact and nondestructive optical\nmethod. Taking the compressive strained tetragonal BiFeO3 (BFO) as an example\nand combining density functional theory calculations with the minimal one-band\ntight-binding models, we find that when BFO changes from C1-type\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) phase to G-type AFM phase, the top of valance band\nshifts from the Z point to {\\Gamma} point, which makes the original direct band\ngap become indirect. This can be explained by the two-center Slater-Koster\nparameters using the Harrison approach. The impact of magnetic ordering on\nenergy band dispersion dramatically changes the optical properties of\ntetragonal BFO. For the linear ones, the energy shift of the optical band gap\ncould be as large as 0.4 eV. As for the nonlinear ones, the change is even\nlarger. The second-harmonic generation coefficient d33 of G-AFM becomes more\nthan 13 times smaller than that of C1-type AFM case.

One considers the case of free standing\ngraphene taking into account interaction with intrinsic acoustic phonons. The\ntemperatures considered range from liquid nitrogen to the room level. It has\nturned out that the contribution to thermoelectromotive force due to electron\ndrag by phonons is determined by the Fermi energy in the sample and phonon\nrelaxation time. The explicit temperature dependence of the contribution to\nthermoelectromotive force deriving from by phonons is weak in contrast to that\ndue to diffusion, which is directly proportional to temperature. The dependence\nobtained suggests that at the temperatures considered, a high carrier\nconcentration and for samples with a high thermal conductivity, the phonon drag\ncontribution can become dominant. Thus a theoretical limit has been established\nfor a possible increase of the thermoelectromotive force through electron drag\nby the intrinsic phonons of graphene.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures"]}]
