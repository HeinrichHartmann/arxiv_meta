Such a representation allows linear optimization problems\nover P to be written as semidefinite programs of size d. Such representations\ncan be beneficial in practice when d is much smaller than the number of facets\nof the polytope P. In this paper we are concerned with so-called equivariant\npsd lifts (also known as symmetric psd lifts) which respect the symmetries of\nthe polytope P. We present a representation-theoretic framework to study\nequivariant psd lifts of a certain class of symmetric polytopes known as\norbitopes. Our main result is a structure theorem where we show that any\nequivariant psd lift of size d of an orbitope is of sum-of-squares type where\nthe functions in the sum-of-squares decomposition come from an invariant\nsubspace of dimension smaller than d^3. We use this framework to study two\nwell-known families of polytopes, namely the parity polytope and the cut\npolytope, and we prove exponential lower bounds for equivariant psd lifts of\nthese polytopes.\n","Comment: v2: 30 pages, Minor changes in presentation; v3: 29 pages, New\n  structure theorem for general orbitopes + changes in presentation"]}]

For a given temperature, the effective\ninteraction is obtained best from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on a\ndensity functional approach, this study proposes three methods of predicting\nthe PMF for any temperature based on a single molecular dynamics simulation for\none temperature. The three methods construct the PMF by considering the ligands\nas an ideal gas, as hard-sphere chains, or as Lennard-Jones interaction sites.\nTo apply this methodology, the density of the interaction centers must be\nextracted from the simulation data. For the ideal gas model, a straightforward\nsampling procedure with a fixed lattice in space leads to free energies that\nare too large in order to consistently explain the simulation data for\ndifferent temperatures. Naive sampling does not account for the small momenta\nadded to the NCs when coupled to a thermostat. A method is proposed that\ncorrects for the unphysical steps during the simulation. The ideal gas\ncontribution computed for the corrected density is significantly smaller than\nthe one obtained from naive sampling and can thus explain the temperature\ndependence of the PMF correctly. For the hard-sphere chain model, where a\nweighted density is used, the correction of the particle density is not\nessential. However, the PMF calculated based on the corrected density confirms\nour approach. All three models predict PMF curves in very good agreement with\nsimulation results, but they differ in the number of input parameters and the\ncomputational effort.

In the first part of the paper, two methods are proposed, one\nprimal and one dual. These methods generate a sequence of iterates that are\nfeasible with respect to the equality constraints associated with the\noptimality conditions of the primal-dual form. The primal method maintains\nfeasibility of the primal inequalities while driving the infeasibilities of the\ndual inequalities to zero.

The Bayesian Network, which is one of the most common PGMs\nused in machine learning and data mining, demonstrates this limitation when the\ntraining data consists of random variables, each of them has a large set of\npossible values.

Network pruning is a\npromising technique to solve this problem. However, pruning usually results in\nirregular network connections that not only demand extra representation efforts\nbut also do not fit well on parallel computation. We introduce structured\nsparsity at various scales for convolutional neural networks, which are channel\nwise, kernel wise and intra kernel strided sparsity. This structured sparsity\nis very advantageous for direct computational resource savings on embedded\ncomputers, parallel computing environments and hardware based systems. To\ndecide the importance of network connections and paths, the proposed method\nuses a particle filtering approach. The importance weight of each particle is\nassigned by computing the misclassification rate with corresponding\nconnectivity pattern. The pruned network is re-trained to compensate for the\nlosses due to pruning. While implementing convolutions as matrix products, we\nparticularly show that intra kernel strided sparsity with a simple constraint\ncan significantly reduce the size of kernel and feature map matrices.

However, most chemists and\nphysicists are unaware of how the observed and/or calculated spin orientations\nare related to the local electronic structures of the magnetic ions. The\nobjective of this article is to provide a conceptual framework of thinking\nabout and predicting the preferred spin orientation of a magnetic ion by\nexamining the relationship between the spin orientation and the local\nelectronic structure of the ion. In general, a magnetic ion (i.e., an ion\npossessing unpaired spins) in a solid or a molecule is surrounded with\nmain-group ligand atoms to form a polyhedron, and the d-states of the\npolyhedron are split because the antibonding interactions of the metal\nd-orbitals with the p orbitals of the surrounding ligands depend on the\nsymmetries of the orbitals involved. The magnetic ion of the polyhedron has a\ncertain preferred spin direction because its split d-states interact among\nthemselves under SOC and because the energy lowering associated with the\nSOC-induced interactions depends on spin orientation. The preferred spin\ndirection can be readily predicted on the basis of perturbation theory, in\nwhich the SOC is taken as perturbation and the split d-states as unperturbed\nstates, by inspecting the magnetic quantum numbers of its d-orbitals present in\nthe HOMO and LUMO of the polyhedron. Experimentally, the determination of the\npreferred spin orientations of magnetic ions requires a sophisticated level of\nexperiments.

Using extreme-value form statistics to test against\nsparse alternatives and using quadratic form statistics to test against dense\nalternatives are two important testing procedures for high-dimensional\nindependence.
