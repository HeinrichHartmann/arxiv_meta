RDS typically leads to biased sampling, favoring participants with\nmany acquaintances. Naive estimates, such as the sample average, which are\nuncorrected for the sampling bias, will themselves be biased.

Although\nstep one is able to accurately recover the delay-structure of the network, thus\ngetting rid of any \\textit{a priori} guess about the time scales of the\ninteraction, the inference method introduces nonetheless an arbitrary time\nscale, the time-bin $dt$ used to binarize the spike trains.

In this article,\nthe traditional attractor reconstruction method is first used for two types of\nECG signals: Normal healthy persons (NHP) and Congestive Heart failure patients\n(CHFP). As common in such a framework, the reconstructed attractors are not at\nall well formed and hence it is not possible to adequately characterize their\ngeometrical features. Thus, we incorporate frequency domain information to the\ngiven time signals. This is done by transforming the signals to a time\nfrequency domain by means of suitable Wavelet transforms (WT). The transformed\nsignal concerns two non homogeneous variables and is still quite difficult to\nuse to reconstruct some dynamics out of it. By applying a suitable mapping,\nthis signal is further converted into integer domain and a new type of 3D plot,\ncalled integer lag plot, which characterizes and distinguishes the ECG signals\nof NHP and CHFP, is finally obtained.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to reprocess the\n  analysis of the research"]}]

While it somewhat\nincreases the spin moment of the Fe atoms, it has little effect on their\norbital moment; at the same time, it greatly increases both the spin and\norbital moment of the Pt atoms. Given the fact that the spin-orbit coupling\n(SOC) constant of Pt is about 7 times greater than that of Fe, this Fe-induced\njump in the orbital moment of the Pt atoms produces the increase in MCA of the\ncomposite structures over that of their pure counterparts. That any composite\nstructure exhibits higher MCA than bulk L10 FePt results from the lower\ncoordination of Pt atoms in the cluster, whether Fe or Pt predominates within\nit. We also find that bipyramidal clusters whose central layer is Pt have\nhigher MCA than their same-sized counterparts whose central layer is Fe.

Within a month the accretion rate reaches super-Eddington levels. It\nthen drops gradually over a time scale of a year to sub-Eddington regimes. The\ninitially geometrically thick disk becomes a thin one and eventually an ADAF at\nvery low accretion rates. As such, TDEs explore the whole range of accretion\nrates and configurations. A challenging question is what the corresponding\nlight curves of these events are. We explore numerically the disk luminosity\nand the conditions within the inner region of the disk using a fully general\nrelativistic slim disk model. Those conditions determine the magnitude of the\nmagnetic field that engulfs the black hole and this, in turn, determines the\nBlandford-Znajek jet power.

The jet power follows initially the accretion\nrate but remains a constant after the transition from super- to sub- Eddington.\nAt lower accretion rates at the end of the MAD phase the disk becomes thin and\nthe jet may stop altogether. These new estimates of the jet power and disk\nluminosity that do not simply follow the mass fallback rate should be taken\ninto account when searching for TDEs and analysing light curves of TDE\ncandidates.

This model leads to a simplified perspective on the\nnature of turbulence in a weakly collisional plasma: the nonlinear interactions\nresponsible for the turbulent cascade of energy and the formation of current\nsheets are essentially fluid in nature, while the collisionless damping of the\nturbulent fluctuations and the energy injection by kinetic instabilities are\nessentially kinetic in nature.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 2 figures, 196 references, accepted for publication in\n  Theme Issue on \"Dissipation & Heating in Solar Wind Turbulence\" in\n  Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A"]}]

Amongst the collection\nof mathematical models considered, a best model strongly supported by\nexperimental data is identified. Fundamental to this approach is the fact that\noptimal parameter values associated with the best fit for each model are\nestablished. The best candidate among the best fits is characterized by the\ndisassembly of the assembled keratin material in the perinuclear region and an\nactive transport of the assembled keratin. Our study shows that an active\ntransport of the assembled keratin is required to explain the experimentally\nobserved keratin organization.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 11 Figures"]}]

For the special case of tau Boo b, whose orbital\nperiod is tidally locked to the rotation period of its host star, variability\nonly occurs on the time-scale of the magnetic cycle. The lack of radio\nvariability on the synodic period at tau Boo b is not predicted by previous\nradio emission models, which do not account for the co-rotation of the\ninterplanetary plasma at small distances from the star.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, accepted in MNRAS"]}]

Some circumstellar-interacting (CSI) supernovae (SNe) are produced\nby the explosions of massive stars that have lost mass shortly before the SN\nexplosion. There is evidence that the precursors of some SNe IIn were luminous\nblue variable (LBV) stars. For a small number of CSI SNe, outbursts have been\nobserved before the SN explosion. Eruptive events of massive stars are named as\nSN impostors (SN IMs) and whether they herald a forthcoming SN or not is still\nunclear. The large variety of observational properties of CSI SNe suggests the\nexistence of other progenitors, such as red supergiant (RSG) stars with\nsuperwinds. Furthermore, the role of metallicity in the mass loss of CSI SN\nprogenitors is still largely unexplored. Aims. Our goal is to gain insight on\nthe nature of the progenitor stars of CSI SNe by studying their environments,\nin particular the metallicity at their locations. Methods. We obtain\nmetallicity measurements at the location of 60 transients (including SNe IIn,\nSNe Ibn, and SN IMs), via emission-line diagnostic on optical spectra obtained\nat the Nordic Optical Telescope and through public archives. Metallicity values\nfrom the literature complement our sample. We compare the metallicity\ndistributions among the different CSI SN subtypes and to those of other\ncore-collapse SN types. We also search for possible correlations between\nmetallicity and CSI SN observational properties. Results. We find that SN IMs\ntend to occur in environments with lower metallicity than those of SNe IIn.\nAmong SNe IIn, SN IIn-L(1998S-like) SNe show higher metallicities, similar to\nthose of SNe IIL/P, whereas long-lasting SNe IIn (1988Z-like) show lower\nmetallicities, similar to those of SN IMs. The metallicity distribution of SNe\nIIn can be reproduced by combining the metallicity distributions of SN IMs\n(that may be produced by major outbursts of massive stars like LBVs) and SNe\nIIP (produced by RSGs). The same applies to the distributions of the Normalized\nCumulative Rank (NCR) values, which quantifies the SN association to H II\nregions. For SNe IIn, we find larger mass-loss rates and higher CSM velocities\nat higher metallicities. The luminosity increment in the optical bands during\nSN IM outbursts tend to be larger at higher metallicity, whereas the SN IM\nquiescent optical luminosities tend to be lower. Conclusions. The difference in\nmetallicity between SNe IIn and SN IMs suggests that LBVs are only one of the\nprogenitor channels for SNe IIn, with 1988Z-like and 1998S-like SNe possibly\narising from LBVs and RSGs, respectively. Finally, even though linedriven winds\nlikely do not primarily drive the late mass-loss of CSI SN progenitors,\nmetallicity has some impact on the observational properties of these\ntransients.

However, its physical\njustification was questioned because self-accelerating TCs simulated with the\nsteady TEM seemed to violate the turbulent kinetic energy balance. This\nviolation was considered as a result of very strong sediment erosion that\nconsumes more turbulent kinetic energy than is produced. To confine bed erosion\nand thus remedy this issue, the four-equation model (FEM) was introduced by\nassuming a proportionality between the bed shear stress and the turbulent\nkinetic energy. Here we analytically proof that self-accelerating TCs simulated\nwith the original steady TEM actually never violate the turbulent kinetic\nenergy balance, provided that the bed drag coefficient is not unrealistically\nlow. We find that stronger bed erosion, surprisingly, leads to more production\nof turbulent kinetic energy due to conversion of potential energy of eroded\nmaterial into kinetic energy of the current. Furthermore, we analytically show\nthat, for asymptotically supercritical flow conditions, the original steady TEM\nalways produces self-accelerating TCs if the upstream boundary conditions\n(\"ignition\" values) are chosen appropriately, while it never does so for\nasymptotically subcritical flow conditions. We numerically show that our novel\nmethod to obtain the ignition values even works for Richardson numbers very\nnear to unity.

We then present a numerical implementation of thermally\nideal gases obeying a more general caloric EoS with non-constant adiabatic\nindex in Godunov-type numerical schemes.We discuss the necessary modifications\nto the Riemann solver and to the conversion between total energy and pressure\n(or vice-versa) routinely invoked in Godunov-type schemes. We then present two\ndifferent approaches for computing the EoS.The first one employs root-finder\nmethods and it is best suited for EoS in analytical form. The second one leans\non lookup table and interpolation and results in a more computationally\nefficient approach although care must be taken to ensure thermodynamic\nconsistency. A number of selected benchmarks demonstrate that the employment of\na non-ideal EoS can lead to important differences in the solution when the\ntemperature range is $500-10^4$ K where dissociation and ionization occur. The\nimplementation of selected EoS introduces additional computational costs\nalthough using lookup table methods can significantly reduce the overhead by a\nfactor $3\\sim 4$.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 10 figures, Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Asteroids with semi-major axes very close to that of a host planet\ncan avoid node crossings when their nodal points are at perihelion and at\naphelion.

Here, we study the short-term dynamical evolution of four recently\ndiscovered near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) --2012 FC71, 2014 EK24, 2014 QD364, and\n2014 UR-- that follow very Earth-like orbits.\n  Methods. Our analysis is based on results of direct N-body calculations that\nuse the most updated ephemerides and include perturbations from the eight major\nplanets, the Moon, the barycentre of the Pluto-Charon system, and the three\nlargest asteroids.\n  Results. These four NEAs exhibit an orbital evolution unlike any other known\nnear-Earth object (NEO). Beyond horseshoe, tadpole, or quasi-satellite\ntrajectories, they follow co-orbital passing orbits relative to the Earth\nwithin the Kozai domain. Our calculations show that secular interactions induce\nlibrations of their relative argument of perihelion with respect to our planet\nbut also to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Secular chaos is also present. The size\nof this transient population is probably large.\n  Conclusions. Although some of these NEAs can remain orbitally stable for many\nthousands of years, their secular dynamics are substantially more complicated\nthan commonly thought and cannot be properly described within the framework of\nthe three-body problem alone owing to the overlapping of multiple secular\nresonances. Objects in this group are amongst the most atypical NEOs regarding\nfavourable visibility windows because these are separated in time by many\ndecades or even several centuries.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 18 figures, 3 tables.

Before the discontinuity happened, planetesimals located at ~40\nAU were swept into Neptune's 2:1 resonance, and were carried with the migrating\nresonance outwards. The 2:1 resonance was at ~44 AU when Neptune reached ~28\nAU. If Neptune's semimajor axis changed by fraction of AU at this point,\nperhaps because Neptune was scattered off of another planet, the 2:1 population\nwould have been released at ~44 AU, and would remain there to this day. We show\nthat the orbital distribution of bodies produced in this model provides a good\nmatch to the orbital properties of the kernel. If Neptune migration was\nconveniently slow after the jump, the sweeping 2:1 resonance would deplete the\npopulation of bodies at ~45-47 AU, thus contributing to the paucity of the\nlow-inclination orbits in this region.

We find that the local dynamo action takes place mostly in a\nshallow, about 500~km deep, subsurface layer, from which the generated field is\ntransported into the deeper layers by convective downdrafts. We demonstrate\nthat the observed dominance of vertical magnetic fields at the photosphere and\nhorizontal fields above the photosphere can be explained by small-scale\nmagnetic loops produced by the dynamo. Such small-scale loops play an important\nrole in the structure and dynamics of the solar atmosphere and that their\ndetection in observations is critical for understanding the local dynamo action\non the Sun.\n","Comment: 40pages, 18 figures; accepted to ApJ. arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1312.0982"]}]

In this work,\nsingle GPS station-based ionospheric modelling is performed at a time\nresolution of 10 minutes. Also the receiver DCBs are estimated for selected\nGeoscience Australia (GA) GPS receivers, located at Murchison Radio Observatory\n(MRO1), Yarragadee (YAR3), Mount Magnet (MTMA) and Wiluna (WILU). The\nionospheric gradients estimated from GPS are compared with the ionospheric\ngradients inferred from radio source position shifts observed with the MWA. The\nionospheric gradients at all the GPS stations show a correlation with the\ngradients observed with the MWA. The ionosphere estimates obtained using GPS\nmeasurements show promise in terms of providing calibration information for the\nMWA.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

Tracking is carried out in\nthe Bayesian framework and its extension to a distributed context is made\npossible via an information-theoretic approach to data fusion which exploits\nconsensus algorithms and the notion of Kullback-Leibler Average (KLA) of the\nProbability Density Functions (PDFs) to be fused. The first step toward\ndistributed tracking considers a single moving object. Consensus takes place in\neach agent for spreading information over the network so that each node can\ntrack the object. To achieve such a goal, consensus is carried out on the local\nsingle-object posterior distribution, which is the result of local data\nprocessing, in the Bayesian setting, exploiting the last available measurement\nabout the object. The next step is in the direction of distributed estimation\nof multiple moving objects. In order to model, in a rigorous and elegant way, a\npossibly time-varying number of objects present in a given area of interest,\nthe Random Finite Set (RFS) formulation is adopted since it provides the notion\nof probability density for multi-object states that allows to directly extend\nexisting tools in distributed estimation to multi-object tracking. The last\ntheoretical step of the present dissertation is toward distributed filtering\nwith the further requirement of unique object identities. To this end the\nlabeled RFS framework is adopted as it provides a tractable approach to the\nmulti-object Bayesian recursion.

Such models play an important role in\nnatural language processing tasks such as translation or speech recognition,\nbut often rely on the simplistic assumption that words are opaque symbols. This\nassumption does not fit morphologically complex language well, where words can\nhave rich internal structure and sub-word elements are shared across distinct\nword forms.\n  Our approach is to encode basic notions of morphology into the assumptions of\nthree different types of language models, with the intention that leveraging\nshared sub-word structure can improve model performance and help overcome data\nsparsity that arises from morphological processes.\n  In the context of n-gram language modelling, we formulate a new Bayesian\nmodel that relies on the decomposition of compound words to attain better\nsmoothing, and we develop a new distributed language model that learns vector\nrepresentations of morphemes and leverages them to link together\nmorphologically related words. In both cases, we show that accounting for word\nsub-structure improves the models' intrinsic performance and provides benefits\nwhen applied to other tasks, including machine translation.\n  We then shift the focus beyond the modelling of word sequences and consider\nmodels that automatically learn what the sub-word elements of a given language\nare, given an unannotated list of words. We formulate a novel model that can\nlearn discontiguous morphemes in addition to the more conventional contiguous\nmorphemes that most previous models are limited to.

Second,\nwe introduce a network-based measure of node similarity to compare the GVCs\nbetween any pair of countries for each sector and each year available in the\nWIOD. Our network-based similarity is a better measure for node comparison than\nthe existing ones because it takes into account all the direct and indirect\nrelationships between country-sector pairs, is applicable to both directed and\nweighted networks with self-loops, and takes into account externally defined\nnode attributes. As a result, our measure of similarity reveals the most\nintensive interactions among the GVCs across countries and over time. From 1995\nto 2011, the average similarity between sectors and countries have clear\nincreasing trends, which are temporarily interrupted by the recent economic\ncrisis.
