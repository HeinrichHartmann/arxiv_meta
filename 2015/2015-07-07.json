We find that: (1)\nthe inclusion of the merger/ringdown portion of the signal does not\nsignificantly affect rates for NS-NS and BH-NS systems, but it boosts rates by\na factor $\\sim 1.5$ for BH-BH systems; (2) in almost all of our models BH-BH\nsystems yield by far the largest rates, followed by NS-NS and BH-NS systems,\nrespectively, and (3) a majority of the detectable BH-BH systems were formed in\nthe early Universe in low-metallicity environments. We make predictions for the\ndistributions of detected binaries and discuss what the first GW detections\nwill teach us about the astrophysics underlying binary formation and evolution.\n","Comment: published in ApJ, 19 pages, 11 figures"]}]

The ratio of BCG stellar mass (including this\ndiffuse component) to total cluster stellar mass is ~30 per cent.\n","Comment: Accepted by MNRAS, conclusions and figures unchanged, minor revision\n  to discussion; 18 pages, 16 figures (appendix 2 pages, 3 figures)"]}]

We give\ntables and plots that allow to easily evaluate the fine-tuning and the\ncorresponding naturalness bounds for any theoretical model defined at any\nhigh-energy (HE) scale.

It is extremely likely\n(probability $P = 0.95$) that 20th century RSL rise at Sand Point, NC, (2.8\n$\\pm$ 0.5 mm/yr) was faster than during any other century in at least 2,900\nyears. Projections based on a fusion of process models, statistical models,\nexpert elicitation, and expert assessment indicate that RSL at Wilmington, NC,\nis very likely ($P = 0.90$) to rise by 42--132 cm between 2000 and 2100 under\nthe high-emissions RCP 8.5 pathway. Under all emission pathways, 21st century\nRSL rise is very likely ($P > 0.90$) to be faster than during the 20th century.\nDue to RSL rise, under RCP 8.5, the current `1-in-100 year' flood is expected\nat Wilmington in $\\mathord{\\sim}$30 of the 50 years between 2050-2100.\n","Comment: 13 main text pages, 4 figures, 4 supplemental pages.

We derive various general\nidentities: relating the negativity after the quench with unequal left and\nright initial temperatures, with that with equal left and right temperatures;\nand relating these with the negativity in equilibrium thermal states. In\ncertain regimes the resulting expressions can be analytically evaluated.\nImmediately after the interval interesects the lightcone, we find logarithmic\ngrowth. For a very long interval, we find that the negativity approaches a\nplateau after sufficiently long times, different from its NESS value. This\nprovides a theoretical framework explaining recently obtained numerical\nresults.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 13 figures"]}]

A statistical analysis of the symmetry distribution performed in several\nnovels showed that most of the words do not display symmetric patterns of\nconnectivity. More specifically, the merged symmetry displayed a distribution\nsimilar to the ubiquitous power-law distribution. Our experiments also revealed\nthat the studied metrics do not correlate with other traditional network\nmeasurements, such as the degree or betweenness centrality. The effectiveness\nof the symmetry measurements was verified in the authorship attribution task.\nInterestingly, we found that specific authors prefer particular types of\nsymmetric motifs. As a consequence, the authorship of books could be accurately\nidentified in 82.5% of the cases, in a dataset comprising books written by 8\nauthors. Because the proposed measurements for text analysis are complementary\nto the traditional approach, they can be used to improve the characterization\nof text networks, which might be useful for related applications, such as those\nrelying on the identification of topical words and information retrieval.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Europhys.

By considering the first order\nself$-$energy corrections to the spin wave spectrum, magnon decay rate,\nbimagnon interactions within the ladder approximation Bethe-Salpeter scheme,\nand the effect of three-magnon contributions up to 1/S- order we find that the\nRIXS spectra is non-trivially affected. For a purely isotropic triangular\nlattice model, the peak splitting mechanism and the appearance of a multipeak\nRIXS structure is primarily dictated by the damping of magnon modes. At a\nscattering wavevector corresponding to the zone center \\Gamma point and at the\nroton point q=M, where the magnon decay rate is zero, a stable single peak\nforms. At the $\\Gamma$ point, the contribution is purely trimagnon at the 1/S\nlevel and occurs approximately at the trimagnon energy of 6JS. The roton peak\noccurs at a lower energy of 4JS. The K-edge single peak RIXS spectra at the\nroton momentum can be utilized as an experimental signature to detect the\npresence of roton excitations. A unique feature of the triangular lattice\nK-edge RIXS spectra is the nonvanishing RIXS intensity at both the zone center\n$\\Gamma$ point and the antiferromagnetic wavevector K point. This result is in\nsharp contrast to the vanishing K-edge RIXS intensity of the collinear magnetic\nphases on the square lattice. We find that including XXZ anisotropy leads to\nadditional peak splitting, including at the roton scattering wavevector where\nthe single peak destabilizes towards a two-peak structure.

There are two main technical\nchallenges. First, to get significant acceleration, the sail must be both\nextremely light weight and capable of operating at high intensities of the\nincident beam and the resulting high temperatures. Second, the transmitter must\nemit high power beams through huge apertures, many kilometers in diameter, in\norder to focus radiation on the sail across the long distances needed to\nachieve high final speeds. Existing proposals for the sail use carbon or\naluminum films, but aluminum is limited by a low melting point, and both have\nlow mechanical strength requiring either a distributed payload or complex\nrigging. We propose here a graphene sail, which offers high absorption per unit\nweight, high temperature operation, and the mechanical strength to support\nsimple rigging to a lumped mass payload. For the transmitter, existing\nproposals use a compact high power source, and focus the energy with a large\n(hundreds to thousands of km) space-based lens. Existing optical drive\nproposals also require launch from the outer solar system, have severe pointing\nrestrictions, and require difficult maneuvering of the beam source. Instead we\npropose an active Fresnel lens, allowing smaller apertures of less mass, easier\npointing with fewer restrictions, and probe launch from the inner solar system.\nThe technologies for both the sail and the transmitter are already under\ndevelopment for other reasons. Worked examples, physically smaller and less\nmassive than those suggested so far, range from a 1kg payload launched to 10\\%\nof the speed of light by a transmitter only 25 times the mass of ISS, to a\nlarger system that can launch a 1000 kg payload to 50\\% of the speed of light.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables.

However, if we want to\nconsider for example communication based on analogue signals, we will have to\nconsider messages that might be functions selected from an infinite function\nspace. In this paper, we extend linear network coding over finite/discrete\nalphabets/message space to the infinite/continuous case. The key to our\napproach is to view the space of operators that acts linearly on a space of\nsignals as a module over a ring.\n  It turns out that modules over many rings $R$ leads to unrealistic network\nmodels where communication channels have unlimited capacity. We show that a\nnatural condition to avoid this is equivalent to the ring $R$ being Dedekind\nfinite (or Neumann finite) i.e. each element in $R$ has a left inverse if and\nonly if it has a right inverse. We then consider a strengthened capacity\ncondition and show that this requirement precisely corresponds to the class of\n(faithful) modules over stably finite rings (or weakly finite).\n  The introduced framework makes it possible to compare the performance of\ndigital and analogue techniques. It turns out that within our model, digital\nand analogue communication outperforms each other in different situations. More\nspecifically we construct: 1) A communications network where digital\ncommunication outperforms analogue communication. 2) A communication network\nwhere analogue communication outperforms digital communication.\n  The performance of a communication network is in the finite case usually\nmeasured in terms band width (or capacity). We show this notion also remains\nvalid for finite dimensional matrix rings which make it possible (in principle)\nto establish gain of digital versus analogue (analogue versus digital)\ncommunications.\n"]}]
