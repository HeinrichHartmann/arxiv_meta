Examples include metabolism where a handful of building blocks\nmediate between multiple input nutrients and multiple output biomass\ncomponents, and signaling networks where information from numerous receptor\ntypes passes through a small set of signaling pathways to regulate multiple\noutput genes. Little is known, however, about how bow-tie architectures evolve.\nHere, we address the evolution of bow-tie architectures using simulations of\nmulti-layered systems evolving to fulfill a given input-output goal. We find\nthat bow-ties spontaneously evolve when two conditions are met: (i) the\nevolutionary goal is rank deficient, where the rank corresponds to the minimal\nnumber of input features on which the outputs depend, and (ii) The effects of\nmutations on interaction intensities between components are described by\nproduct rule - namely the mutated element is multiplied by a random number.\nProduct-rule mutations are more biologically realistic than the commonly used\nsum-rule mutations that add a random number to the mutated element. These\nconditions robustly lead to bow-tie structures. The minimal width of the\nintermediate network layers (the waist or knot of the bow-tie) equals the rank\nof the evolutionary goal.
