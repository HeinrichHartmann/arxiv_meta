To illustrate the approach we consider a\nmonoatomic layer of correlated orbitals, described by the single-band Hubbard\nmodel, attached to two metallic leads.

One of the ways to model illiquidity\namong others is to build an optimization problem and assume that one of the\nassets in a portfolio can not be sold until a certain finite, infinite or\nrandom moment of time. This approach arises a certain amount of models that are\nactively studied at the moment.\n  Working in the Merton's optimal consumption framework with continuous time we\nconsider an optimization problem for a portfolio with an illiquid, a risky and\na risk-free asset. Our goal in this paper is to carry out a complete Lie group\nanalysis of PDEs describing value function and investment and consumption\nstrategies for a portfolio with an illiquid asset that is sold in an exogenous\nrandom moment of time with a prescribed liquidation time distribution. The\nproblem of such type leads to three dimensional nonlinear\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Such equations are not only tedious\nfor analytical methods but are also quite challenging form a numeric point of\nview. To reduce the three-dimensional problem to a two-dimensional one or even\nto an ODE one usually uses some substitutions, yet the methods used to find\nsuch substitutions are rarely discussed by the authors.\n  We find the admitted Lie algebra for a broad class of liquidation time\ndistributions in cases of HARA and log utility functions and formulate\ncorresponding theorems for all these cases. We use found Lie algebras to obtain\nreductions of the studied equations. Several of similar substitutions were used\nin other papers before whereas others are new to our knowledge.

Sticking\nto the original story behind this problem, suppose we have to deliver a bomb in\nsome distant point of the globe, the distance being much greater than the range\nof any individual airplane at our disposal. Therefore, the only feasible option\nto carry out this mission is to better utilize our fleet via mid-air refueling.\nStarting with several airplanes that can refuel one another, and gradually drop\nout of the flight until the single plane carrying the bomb reaches the target,\nhow would you plan the refueling policy?\n  The main contribution of Gamow and Stern was to provide a complete\ncharacterization of the optimal refueling policy for the special case of\nidentical airplanes. In spite of their elegant and easy-to-analyze solution,\nthe computational complexity of the general airplane refueling problem, with\narbitrary tank volumes and consumption rates, has remained widely open ever\nsince, as recently pointed out by Woeginger (Open Problems in Scheduling,\nDagstuhl 2010, page 24). To our knowledge, other than a logarithmic\napproximation, which can be attributed to folklore, it is not entirely obvious\neven if constant-factor performance guarantees are within reach.\n  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the\nairplane refueling problem in its utmost generality. Our approach builds on a\nnovel combination of ideas related to parametric pruning, efficient guessing\ntricks, reductions to well-structured instances of generalized assignment, and\nadditional insight into how LP-rounding algorithms in this context actually\nwork. We complement this result by presenting a fast and easy-to-implement\nalgorithm that approximates the optimal refueling policy to within a constant\nfactor.\n"]}]

We show\nthat in general it is impossible to provide monotonic searchability if\ncorrupted messages are present in the system, which justifies the restriction\nto system states without corrupted messages. Furthermore, we provide a\nself-stabilizing protocol for the line for which we can also show monotonic\nsearchability. It turns out that even for the line it is non-trivial to achieve\nthis property. Additionally, we extend our protocol to deal with node\ndepartures in terms of the Finite Departure Problem of Foreback et. al (SSS\n2014).
