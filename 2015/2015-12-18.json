The calculation of determinants and their derivatives is performed\nusing the Sherman-Morrison formula for updating the inverse Slater matrix. An\nimproved implementation based on the reduction of the number of column\nsubstitutions and on a very efficient implementation of the calculation of the\nscalar products involved is presented. It is emphasized that multideterminant\nexpansions contain in general a large number of identical spin-specific\ndeterminants: for typical configuration interaction-type wavefunctions the\nnumber of unique spin-specific determinants $N_{\\rm det}^\\sigma$\n($\\sigma=\\uparrow,\\downarrow$) with a non-negligible weight in the expansion is\nof order ${\\cal O}(\\sqrt{N_{\\rm det}})$.

In this paper, this\nLCE is applied to analyze the reversible processes coupled between elastic and\nelectromagnetic fields. Here, it is called the energy formulation. For simple\nphysical processes such as mechanical movement, diffusion and electrodynamic\nprocess, it is shown their governing or constitutive equations all satisfy the\nLCE. Then, analysis is extended to coupling effects. First, it is found for the\nlinear direct and converse piezoelectric and piezomagnetic effects, their\nconstitutive equations guarantee energy is conserved during the conversion of\nenergies. Second, analyses found for the generalized Villari effects, the\nelectromagnetic energy can be treated as an extra term in the generalized\nelastic energy. Third, for electrostriction and magnetostriction. It is argued\nboth effects are induced by the Maxwell stress. Their energy is purely\nelectromagnetic, thus both have no converse effects. During these processes,\nenergy can be converted in three ways, i.e., via nonpotential forces, cross\ndependence of energy terms and directly via the interaction of ions and\nelectrons. In the end, general coupling processes which involve elastic,\nelectromagnetic fields and diffusion are also analyzed. The energy formulation,\nwhen combined with the phase-field variational approach, has the potential of\nbeing developed into a general approach to analyze coupling effects between\nreversible and irreversible processes.

In this paper, we propose a deep\nconvolutional neural network for active object recognition that simultaneously\npredicts the object label, and selects the next action to perform on the object\nwith the aim of improving recognition performance. We treat active object\nrecognition as a reinforcement learning problem and derive the cost function to\ntrain the network for joint prediction of the object label and the action. A\ngenerative model of object similarities based on the Dirichlet distribution is\nproposed and embedded in the network for encoding the state of the system. The\ntraining is carried out by simultaneously minimizing the label and action\nprediction errors using gradient descent. We empirically show that the proposed\nnetwork is able to predict both the object label and the actions on GERMS, a\ndataset for active object recognition. We compare the test label prediction\naccuracy of the proposed model with Dirichlet and Naive Bayes state encoding.\nThe results of experiments suggest that the proposed model equipped with\nDirichlet state encoding is superior in performance, and selects images that\nlead to better training and higher accuracy of label prediction at test time.\n"]}]

On one side this definition is a\nnatural generalization of Caputo fractional Dini derivative of a function and\non the other side it allows us the assumption for Lyapunov functions to be\nweakened to continuity. By appropriate examples it is shown the natural\nrelationship between the defined derivative of Lyapunov functions and Caputo\nderivative. Several sufficient conditions for uniform stability and asymptotic\nuniform stability of the zero solution, based on the new definition of the\nderivative of Lyapunov functions are established. Some examples are given to\nillustrate the results.\n"]}]
