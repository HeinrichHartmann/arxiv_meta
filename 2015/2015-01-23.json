The most popular way of detecting communities\nalgorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When\noptimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or\ntime-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph\nensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes\nthat are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the\nnull model.

We introduce local inertial coordinates x^a=(x^0,x^i) in the\nvicinity of a world line of a Hubble observer with the help of a special\nconformal transformation.

Previous reports have shown that this affects the\ngrey matter of the primary visual cortex, but possible effects on the preceding\nvisual pathway structures have not been fully established. Method. In this\nmulticentre study, we used high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance\nimaging and voxel-based morphometry to investigate the visual pathway\nstructures up to the primary visual cortex of patients with age-related macular\ndegeneration (AMD) and juvenile macular degeneration (JMD).

In patients with AMD we found\nvolumetric reductions in the lateral geniculate bodies, the optic radiations\nand the visual cortex.

Predicting space use patterns of animals from their interactions with the\nenvironment is fundamental for understanding the effect of habitat changes on\necosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem have sought to\nunify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from\navailable habitat quality, and mechanistic movement models, where detailed\nmovement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization\ndistribution. Such models bias the animal's movement towards patches that are\neasily available and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability\ndensity at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that\nposition. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch\nof the terrain tends to be a function of the resource quality in both that\npatch and the surrounding habitat. 2. We propose a mechanistic model where this\nnon-local effect of resources naturally emerges from the local movement\nprocesses, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat\nwhere the animal currently resides and that of where it is moving. We give\nstatistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data and\ndemonstrate application of these techniques to GPS data of caribou in\nNewfoundland. 3. Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the\nmodel have complex patterns that cannot be expressed simply as a function of\nthe local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat\nare used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat,\nwhereas isolated patches are used less frequently. 4. Whilst we focus on\nhabitats in this study, our modelling framework can be readily used with any\nenvironmental covariates and therefore represents a unification of mechanistic\nmodelling and step selection approaches to understanding animal space use.\n"]}]

Our interpretation is that this quantification must\nbe done at a minimum of three scales. These scales are at the level of:\nindividual nodes, individual communities, and the network as a whole. Each of\nthese scales involves quantitative features of community structure that are not\naccurately represented at the other scales, but are important for defining a\nparticular notion of community. Our work focuses on providing sensible ways to\nquantify what is desired at each of these scales for a notion of community\napplicable to social networks, and using these models to develop a community\ndetection algorithm. Appealing features of our approach is that it naturally\nallows for nodes to belong to multiple communities, and is computationally\nefficient for large networks with low overall edge density. The scaling of the\nalgorithm is $O(N~\\overline{k^2} + \\overline{N_{com}^2})$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of nodes in the network, $\\overline{N_{com}^2}$ is the average squared\ncommunity size, and $\\overline{k^2}$ is the expected value of a node's degree\nsquared.
