It is well-known that the\nperformance of scheduling over fading channels relies heavily on the accuracy\nof the available Channel State Information (CSI), which is costly to acquire.\nThus, we consider the CSI acquisition via a practical ARQ-based feedback\nmechanism whereby channel states are revealed at the end of only scheduled\nusers' transmissions. In the assumed presence of temporally-correlated channel\nevolutions, the desired scheduler must optimally balance the\nexploitation-exploration trade-off, whereby it schedules transmissions both to\nexploit those channels with up-to-date CSI and to explore the current state of\nthose with outdated CSI.\n  In earlier works, Whittle's Index Policy had been suggested as a\nlow-complexity and high-performance solution to this problem.

In this\nwork, we overcome these difficulties to rigorously establish the asymptotic\noptimality properties of Whittle's Index Policy in the limiting regime of many\nusers. More specifically: (1) we prove the local optimality of Whittle's Index\nPolicy, provided that the initial state of the system is within a certain\nneighborhood of a carefully selected state; (2) we then establish the global\noptimality of Whittle's Index Policy under a recurrence assumption that is\nverified numerically for our problem.

The first\nmechanism is related to an induced Einstein-Hilbert term on warped brane\nworldvolumes, which leads to a shift in the classical volume of the\ncompactification manifold. The resulting corrections are generic and can appear\nat one-loop order on branes and O-planes of various dimensions and for\nconfigurations with or without intersections. We discuss in detail the example\nof intersecting D7-branes/O7-planes, where a correction can appear already at\norder $\\alpha^{\\prime 2}g_s^2$ in the K\\\"ahler potential. Due to an extended\nno-scale structure, however, it is then still subleading in the scalar\npotential. We also discuss a second mechanism, which is due to an induced\nD3-brane charge in the WZ action of D7-branes. Contrary to the first type of\ncorrections, it appears at open string tree-level and shifts the definition of\nthe K\\\"ahler coordinates in terms of the classical volume but leaves the volume\nitself uncorrected.

The ultrafast energy relaxation in graphene occurs through two\ncompeting pathways: carrier-carrier scattering -- creating an elevated carrier\ntemperature -- and optical phonon emission. At present, it is not clear what\ndetermines the dominating relaxation pathway. Here we reach a unifying picture\nof the ultrafast energy relaxation by investigating the terahertz\nphotoconductivity, while varying the Fermi energy, photon energy, and fluence\nover a wide range. We find that sufficiently low fluence ($\\lesssim$ 4\n$\\mu$J/cm$^2$) in conjunction with sufficiently high Fermi energy ($\\gtrsim$\n0.1 eV) gives rise to energy relaxation that is dominated by carrier-carrier\nscattering, which leads to efficient carrier heating. Upon increasing the\nfluence or decreasing the Fermi energy, the carrier heating efficiency\ndecreases, presumably due to energy relaxation that becomes increasingly\ndominated by phonon emission. Carrier heating through carrier-carrier\nscattering accounts for the negative photoconductivity for doped graphene\nobserved at terahertz frequencies.

We also find that intercalating Li ions in between the layers of\nthe graphene/MoS2 heterostructure enhances the binding energy through orbital\nhybridizations between cations (Li adatoms) and anions (graphene and MoS2\nmonolayers). Moreover, we calculate the dielectric function of the Li\nintercalated graphene/MoS2 heterostructure, the imaginary component of which\ncan be directly compared with experimental measurements of optical conductivity\nin order to validate our theoretical prediction. We observe sharp features in\nthe imaginary component of the dielectric function, which shows the presence of\na Drude peak in the optical conductivity, and therefore metallicity in the\nlithiated graphene/MoS2 heterostructure.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Through experiments conducted on\nseveral media benchmarks, we present and discuss trade-offs involved when\nselecting any one of these scheduling techniques.\n","Comment: Presented at DATE Friday Workshop on Heterogeneous Architectures and\n  Design Methods for Embedded Image Systems (HIS 2015) (arXiv:1502.07241)"]}]

A common approach to\nmaintain real-time capabilities of compute-intensive applications is to offload\nthose computations to dedicated accelerator hardware, such as Field\nProgrammable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Programming such architectures is a\nchallenging task, with respect to the typical FPGA-specific design criteria:\nAchievable overall algorithm latency and resource usage of FPGA primitives\n(BRAM, FF, LUT, and DSP). High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dramatically simplifies\nthis task by enabling the description of algorithms in well-known higher\nlanguages (C/C++) and its automatic synthesis that can be accomplished by HLS\ntools. However, algorithm developers still need expert knowledge about the\ntarget architecture, in order to achieve satisfying results. Therefore, in\nprevious work, we have shown that elevating the description of image algorithms\nto an even higher abstraction level, by using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL),\ncan significantly cut down the complexity for designing such algorithms for\nFPGAs. To give the developer even more control over the common trade-off,\nlatency vs. resource usage, we will present an automatic optimization process\nwhere these criteria are analyzed and fed back to the DSL compiler, in order to\ngenerate code that is closer to the desired design specifications.

The main objective in differentially private query processing is\nto maximize the accuracy of the query results, while satisfying the privacy\nguarantees. Previous work, notably \\cite{LHR+10}, has suggested that with an\nappropriate strategy, processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole\nachieves considerably higher accuracy than answering them individually.\nHowever, to our knowledge there is currently no practical solution to find such\na strategy for an arbitrary query batch; existing methods either return\nstrategies of poor quality (often worse than naive methods) or require\nprohibitively expensive computations for even moderately large domains.\nMotivated by this, we propose low-rank mechanism (LRM), the first practical\ndifferentially private technique for answering batch linear queries with high\naccuracy.

While gas giant planets are found preferentially around\nmetal-rich host stars, planets smaller than Neptune orbit hosts with a wide\nrange of metallicities. We propose an alternative interpretation of these\nobservations in the framework of a recently developed planet formation\nhypothesis called Tidal Downsizing (TD).

The simulated population of these\nsmaller planets shows a shallow peak in their formation efficiency at around\nthe Solar metallicity. This result is driven by the fact that at low\nmetallicities the solid core's growth is damped by the scarcity of metals,\nwhereas at high metallicities the fragments within which the cores grow\ncontract too quickly, cutting the core's growth time window short. Finally,\nsimulated giant gas planets do not show a strong host star metallicity\npreference at large separations, which may explain why one of the best known\ndirectly imaged gas giant planet systems, HR 8799, is metal poor.\n","Comment: 13 pages.

Exoplanet searches have unveiled a large\npopulation of short-period objects with hot atmospheres, very different from\nwhat we find in our solar system. Transiting exoplanets whose atmospheres can\nnow be studied by transit spectroscopy receive extremely strong UV fluxes and\nhave typical temperatures ranging from 400 to 2500 K. At these temperatures, UV\nphotolysis cross section data are severely lacking. Our goal is to provide\nhigh-temperature absorption cross sections and their temperature dependency for\nimportant atmospheric compounds. This study is dedicated to CO2, which is\nobserved and photodissociated in exoplanet atmospheres. We performed these\nmeasurements for the 115 - 200 nm range at 300, 410, 480, and 550 K. In the 195\n- 230 nm range, we worked at seven temperatures between 465 and 800 K. We found\nthat the absorption cross section of CO2 is very sensitive to temperature,\nespecially above 160 nm. Within the studied range of temperature, the CO2 cross\nsection can vary by more than two orders of magnitude. This, in particular,\nmakes the absorption of CO2 significant up to wavelengths as high as 230 nm,\nwhile it is negligible above 200 nm at 300 K. To investigate the influence of\nthese new data on the photochemistry of exoplanets, we implemented the measured\ncross section into a 1D photochemical model.

Here we model this\nprocess as a mixed traffic of two groups of RNAP motors that are characterized\nby two distinct pairs of start and stop sites. Each group polymerizes identical\ncopies of a RNA while the RNAs polymerized by the two groups are different.\nThese models, which may also be viewed as two interfering totally asymmetric\nsimple exclusion processes, account for all modes of transcriptional\ninterference in spite of their extreme simplicity. A combination of mean-field\ntheory and computer simulation of these models demonstrate the physical origin\nof the switch-like regulation of the two interfering genes in both\nco-directional and contra-directional traffic of the two groups of RNAP motors.\n","Comment: 6+ pages, including 4 figures"]}]

This necessary condition for viability\nwas proposed by Myerson (1977) and is modeled via an interaction graph\n$G=(V,E)$; a coalition $S\\subseteq V$ is then viable if and only if the induced\ngraph $G[S]$ is connected. The non-emptiness of the core of a coalition game\ncan be tested by a well-known covering LP. Moreover, the integrality gap of its\ndual packing LP defines exactly the multiplicative least-core and the relative\ncost of stability of the coalition game. This gap is upper bounded by the\npacking-covering ratio which, for graphical coalition games, is known to be at\nmost the treewidth of the interaction graph plus one (Meir et al. 2013).\n  We examine the packing-covering ratio and integrality gaps of graphical\ncoalition games in more detail. We introduce the thicket parameter of a graph,\nand prove it precisely measures the packing-covering ratio. It also\napproximately measures the primal and dual integrality gaps. The thicket number\nprovides an upper bound of both integrality gaps. Moreover we show that for any\ninteraction graph, the primal integrality gap is, in the worst case, linear in\nterms of the thicket number while the dual integrality gap is polynomial in\nterms of it. At the heart of our results, is a graph theoretic minmax theorem\nshowing the thicket number is equal to the minimum width of a vine\ndecomposition of the coalition graph (a vine decomposition is a generalization\nof a tree decomposition). We also explain how the thicket number relates to the\nVC-dimension of the set system produced by the game.\n"]}]
