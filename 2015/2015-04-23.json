We find that there is no significant difference\nbetween the several phenomenological models studied here and the standard one,\nin which {\\alpha} does not vary spatially.

The application of the new dependent variable,\nthe reduced particle velocity, instead of the usual fluid flow rate,\nfacilitates the computation of the crack propagation speed from the local\nrelation based on the speed equation. As a result, the position of the crack\nfront is accurately determined from an explicit formula derived from the speed\nequation.

The design\nis readily implemented on segmented-mirror telescope architectures, utilizing a\nsingle nulling interferometer to achieve high throughput, a small inner working\nangle (IWA), sixth-order or higher starlight suppression, and full off-axis\ndiscovery space, a combination of features that other coronagraph designs\ngenerally must trade.

However, in the presence of a high-dimensional\nand/or multimodal posterior distribution, it is widely documented that standard\nMonte-Carlo techniques could lead to poor performance. In this paper, the study\nis focused on a Sequential Monte-Carlo (SMC) sampler framework, a more robust\nand efficient Monte Carlo algorithm.

In this work,\nwe aim at proposing some novel strategies that will improve the efficiency and\nfacilitate practical implementation of the SMC sampler specifically for signal\nprocessing applications. Firstly, we propose an automatic and adaptive strategy\nthat selects the sequence of distributions within the SMC sampler that\nminimizes the asymptotic variance of the estimator of the posterior\nnormalization constant. This is critical for performing model selection in\nmodelling applications in Bayesian signal processing. The second original\ncontribution we present improves the global efficiency of the SMC sampler by\nintroducing a novel correction mechanism that allows the use of the particles\ngenerated through all the iterations of the algorithm (instead of only\nparticles from the last iteration). This is a significant contribution as it\nremoves the need to discard a large portion of the samples obtained, as is\nstandard in standard SMC methods.

In addition to\nhaving good practical performances, these methods are supported by a\nwell-developed theory. Kernel methods use an implicit mapping of the input data\ninto a high dimensional feature space defined by a kernel function, i.e., a\nfunction returning the inner product between the images of two data points in\nthe feature space. Central to any kernel method is the kernel matrix, which is\nbuilt by evaluating the kernel function on a given sample dataset.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of non-asymptotic spectral theory of\nrandom kernel matrices.

The\ntime-based analysis approach draws on data from high-precision phasor\nmeasurement units (PMUs or synchrophasors) for distribution systems. A key fact\nis that time-series data taken from a dynamic system show specific patterns\nregarding state transitions such as opening or closing switches, as a kind of\nsignature from each topology change. The proposed algorithm here is based on\nthe comparison of the actual signature of a recent state transition against a\nlibrary of signatures derived from topology simulations. The IEEE 33-bus model\nis used for initial algorithm validation.\n","Comment: This paper has been submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Power\n  Systems. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1504.00724"]}]

We fully\ncharacterize the worst-case rank efficiency of CSAMs for optimistic and\npessimistic agents, and provide a bound for strategic agents.

Specifically, upon decoding the common\nmessage, each decoder sends a stop signal to the encoder, which transmits\ncontinuously until it receives both stop signals. For the point-to-point case,\nPolyanskiy, Poor, and Verd\\'u (2011) recently demonstrated that variable-length\ncoding combined with stop feedback significantly increases the speed at which\nthe maximum coding rate converges to capacity. This speed-up manifests itself\nin the absence of a square-root penalty in the asymptotic expansion of the\nmaximum coding rate for large blocklengths, a result a.k.a. zero dispersion. In\nthis paper, we show that this speed-up does not necessarily occur for the\nbroadcast channel with common message.
