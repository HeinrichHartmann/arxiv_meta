In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate that contemporary methods for obtaining convergence rates have\nserious limitations when the dimension grows. We then propose a framework for\nrigorously establishing the convergence behavior of commonly used\nhigh-dimensional MCMCs. In particular, we demonstrate theoretically the precise\nnature and severity of the convergence problems of popular MCMCs when\nimplemented in high dimensions, including phase transitions in the convergence\nrates in various $n$ and $p$ regimes, and a universality result across an\nentire spectrum of models. We also show that convergence problems effectively\neliminate the apparent safeguard of geometric ergodicity. We then demonstrate\ntheoretical principles by which MCMCs can be constructed and analyzed to yield\nbounded geometric convergence rates even as the dimension $p$ grows without\nbound. Additionally, we propose a diagnostic tool for establishing convergence.\n"]}]

Conventional algorithms which address this problem have adopted an\niterative method for each channel realization, which requires high\ncomputational complexity. In order to reduce the computational complexity, we\nparameterize the beamforming vector by scalar parameters related to beam\ndirection and power. Then, by employing asymptotic results of random matrix\ntheory with this parametrization, we identify the optimal parameters to\nmaximize the EE in the large system limit assuming that the number of transmit\nantennas and users are large with a fixed ratio. In the asymptotic regime, our\nsolutions depend only on the second order channel statistics, which yields\nsignificantly reduced computational complexity and system overhead compared to\nthe conventional approaches. Hence, the beamforming vector to maximize the EE\nperformance can be determined with local channel state information and the\noptimized parameters. Based on the asymptotic results, the proposed scheme can\nprovide insights on the average EE performance, and a simple yet efficient\nbeamforming strategy is introduced for the finite system case.

Existing\napproaches to causal prediction queries have a number of limitations. First,\nthey exhaustively search over an acyclic causal network to find the most likely\nk effect events; however, data from real event streams frequently reflect\ncyclic causality. Second, they contain conservative assumptions intended to\nexclude all possible non-causal links in the causal network; it leads to the\nomission of many less-frequent but important causal links. We overcome these\nlimitations by proposing a novel event precedence model and a run-time causal\ninference mechanism. The event precedence model constructs a first order\nabsorbing Markov chain incrementally over event streams, where an edge between\ntwo events signifies a temporal precedence relationship between them, which is\na necessary condition for causality. Then, the run-time causal inference\nmechanism learns causal relationships dynamically during query processing. This\nis done by removing some of the temporal precedence relationships that do not\nexhibit causality in the presence of other events in the event precedence\nmodel. This paper presents two query processing algorithms -- one performs\nexhaustive search on the model and the other performs a more efficient reduced\nsearch with early termination. Experiments using two real datasets (cascading\nblackouts in power systems and web page views) verify the effectiveness of the\nprobabilistic top-k prediction queries and the efficiency of the algorithms.\nSpecifically, the reduced search algorithm reduced runtime, relative to\nexhaustive search, by 25-80% (depending on the application) with only a small\nreduction in accuracy.\n"]}]

In particular for Band 4, collective rotation is dominant in\nthe competition with antimagnetic rotation. Moreover, it is shown that the\nbehavior of the ratios between the dynamic moments of inertia and the B(E2)\nvalues reflects the interplay between antimagnetic and collective rotation.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]}]

However, we live in a\nlarge region of the universe where the antimatter can not constitute more than\na very small fraction of the total mass. The cosmic antimatter problem has been\naddressed since the beginning of modern cosmology, but no definite answer has\nbeen formulated despite of the several approaches that can be found in the\nliterature. In this paper we will make a historical review and we will focus on\nthe experimental techniques that has been proposed to reveal directly and\nindirectly the presence of cosmic antimatter in the universe. Indirect searches\ncan be carried on with the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation in the\nmicrowave and gamma-ray range, and of the neutrino flavour, whereas direct\nsearches lay on the measurement of the cosmic rays and probe shorter distances.\nFinally, the current limits on the cosmic antimatter to matter ratio are\ncompared to the sensitivity of future experiments.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 3 figures"]}]
