Both the semantic\ncharacterisation and most known termination methods are concerned with global\ntermination, uniformly of all the terms of a term rewriting system (TRS). In\nthis paper we consider local termination, of specific sets of terms within a\ngiven TRS. The principal goal of this paper is generalising the semantic\ncharacterisation of global termination to local termination. This is made\npossible by admitting the well-founded monotone algebras to be partial. We also\nextend our approach to local relative termination. The interest in local\ntermination naturally arises in program verification, where one is probably\ninterested only in sensible inputs, or just wants to characterise the set of\ninputs for which a program terminates. Local termination will be also be of\ninterest when dealing with a specific class of terms within a TRS that is known\nto be non-terminating, such as combinatory logic (CL) or a TRS encoding\nrecursive program schemes or Turing machines. We show how some of the\nwell-known techniques for proving global termination, such as stepwise removal\nof rewrite rules and semantic labelling, can be adapted to the local case. We\nalso describe transformations reducing local to global termination problems.\nThe resulting techniques for proving local termination have in some cases\nalready been automated. One of our applications concerns the characterisation\nof the terminating S-terms in CL as regular language. Previously this language\nhad already been found via a tedious analysis of the reduction behaviour of\nS-terms. These findings have now been vindicated by a fully automated and\nverified proof.\n"]}]

The refinement algorithm is in charge of giving a meaning to the terms,\ntypes and proof terms directly written by the user or generated by using\ntactics, decision procedures or general automation. The terms are written in an\n\"external syntax\" meant to be user friendly that allows omission of\ninformation, untyped binders and a certain liberal use of user defined\nsub-typing. The refiner modifies the terms to obtain related well typed terms\nin the internal syntax understood by the kernel of the ITP. In particular, it\nacts as a type inference algorithm when all the binders are untyped. The\nproposed algorithm is bi-directional: given a term in external syntax and a\ntype expected for the term, it propagates as much typing information as\npossible towards the leaves of the term. Traditional mono-directional\nalgorithms, instead, proceed in a bottom-up way by inferring the type of a\nsub-term and comparing (unifying) it with the type expected by its context only\nat the end. We propose some novel bi-directional rules for CIC that are\nparticularly effective. Among the benefits of bi-directionality we have better\nerror message reporting and better inference of dependent types. Moreover,\nthanks to bi-directionality, the coercion system for sub-typing is more\neffective and type inference generates simpler unification problems that are\nmore likely to be solved by the inherently incomplete higher order unification\nalgorithms implemented. Finally we introduce in the external syntax the notion\nof vector of placeholders that enables to omit at once an arbitrary number of\narguments. Vectors of placeholders allow a trivial implementation of implicit\narguments and greatly simplify the implementation of primitive and simple\ntactics.\n"]}]

We consider two recent approaches to complementation. The first\nis the rank-based approach of Kupferman and Vardi, which operates over a DAG\nthat embodies all runs of the automaton. This approach is based on the\nobservation that the vertices of this DAG can be ranked in a certain way,\ntermed an odd ranking, iff all runs are rejecting. The second is the\nslice-based approach of K\\\"ahler and Wilke. This approach tracks levels of\n\"split trees\" - run trees in which only essential information about the history\nof each run is maintained. While the slice-based construction is conceptually\nsimple, the complementing automata it generates are exponentially larger than\nthose of the recent rank-based construction of Schewe, and it suffers from the\ndifficulty of symbolically encoding levels of split trees. In this work we\nreformulate the slice-based approach in terms of run DAGs and preorders over\nstates. In doing so, we begin to draw parallels between the rank-based and\nslice-based approaches. Through deeper analysis of the slice-based approach, we\nstrongly restrict the nondeterminism it generates. We are then able to employ\nthe slice-based approach to provide a new odd ranking, called a retrospective\nranking, that is different from the one provided by Kupferman and Vardi. This\nnew ranking allows us to construct a deterministic-in-the-limit rank-based\nautomaton with a highly restricted transition function. Further, by phrasing\nthe slice-based approach in terms of ranks, our approach affords a simple\nsymbolic encoding and achieves the tight bound of Schewe's construction\n"]}]

Logical formulas are then denoted by behaviours. Finally\nproofs are interpreted as designs satisfying particular properties. In that\nway, designs are more general than proofs and we may notice in particular that\nthey are not typed objects. Incarnation is introduced by Girard in Ludics as a\ncharacterization of \"useful\" designs in a behaviour.

This is a popular model for simulation of bulk heat transport\nusing classical molecular dynamics (MD), and is related to transient thermal\ngrating experiments. Nanoscale effects are seen in perhaps their simplest form.\nThe model is solved by an extension of standard quasiparticle gas theory of\nbulk solids.

The spin\nof the object introduces couplings between electric and magnetic deformations\nand new classes of induced Love numbers emerge. For example, a spinning object\nimmersed in a quadrupolar, electric tidal field can acquire some induced mass,\nspin, quadrupole, octupole and hexadecapole moments to second order in the\nspin. The deformations are encoded in a set of inhomogeneous differential\nequations which, remarkably, can be solved analytically in vacuum. We discuss\ncertain subtleties in defining the multipole moments of the central object,\nwhich are due to the difficulty in separating the tidal field from the linear\nresponse of the object in the solution.

Another solution is to modify gravitation\nlaws. In this article, we study a third way that doesn't modify gravitation\nneither matter's distribution, by using a new physical assumption on the\nclusters. Compare with Newtonian gravitation, general relativity (in its\nlinearized approximation) leads to add a new component without changing the\ngravity field.

Here we have developed a new theoretical model of grid fields formation\nbased on synaptic plasticity in synapses connecting PCs in hippocampus and\nneurons in entorhinal cortex. Learning of hexagonally symmetric fields in the\nmodel is due to complex action of several simple biologicaly motivated synaptic\nplasticity rules. These rules include associative synaptic plasticity rules\nsimilar to BCM rule and homeostatic plasticity rules which restrict synaptic\nweigths. In contrast to previously described models, this network could learn\nGC patterns after a very short experience of navigation in a novel environment.\nIn conclusion we suggest that learning on the basis of simple and biologically\nplausible associative synaptic plasticity rules could contribute to the\nformation of grid fields in early development and to maintainence of normal GCs\nactivity patterns in familiar environments.\n"]}]

Methods. We\nused the transit light curve to characterize the planetary parameters relative\nto the stellar parameters. The analysis of HARPS spectra established the\nplanetary nature of the detections, providing their masses. Further photometric\nand spectroscopic ground-based observations provided stellar parameters (log\ng,Teff,v sin i) to characterize the host stars. Our model takes the geometry of\nthe transit to constrain the stellar density into account, which when linked to\nstellar evolutionary models, determines the bulk parameters of the star.\nBecause of the asymmetric shape of the light curve of one of the planets, we\nhad to include the possibility in our model that the stellar surface was not\nstrictly spherical. Results. We present the planetary parameters of CoRoT-28b,\na Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.484+/-0.087MJup; radius 0.955+/-0.066RJup)\norbiting an evolved star with an orbital period of 5.208 51 +/- 0.000 38 days,\nand CoRoT-29b, another Jupiter-sized planet (mass 0.85 +/- 0.20MJup; radius\n0.90 +/- 0.16RJup) orbiting an oblate star with an orbital period of 2.850 570\n+/- 0.000 006 days.

Extremely reddened AGB stars lose mass at high rates of >10^-5\nMsun/yr. This is the very last stage of AGB evolution, in which stars in the\nmass range 2.0--4.0 Msun (for solar metallicity) should have been converted to\nC stars already. The extremely reddened AGB stars in the Galactic bulge are\nhowever predominantly O-rich, implying that they might be either low-mass stars\nor stars at the upper end of the AGB mass range. Aims. To determine the mass\nrange of the most reddened AGB stars in the Galactic bulge. Methods. Using\nVirtual Observatory tools, we constructed spectral energy distributions of a\nsample of 37 evolved stars in the Galactic bulge with extremely red IRAS\ncolours. We fitted DUSTY models to the observational data to infer the\nbolometric fluxes. Applying individual corrections for interstellar extinction\nand adopting a common distance, we determined luminosities and mass-loss rates,\nand inferred the progenitor mass range from comparisons with AGB evolutionary\nmodels. Results. The observed spectral energy distributions are consistent with\na classification as reddened AGB stars, except for two stars, which are\nproto-planetary nebula candidates. For the AGB stars, we found luminosities in\nthe range 3000--30,000 Lsun and mass-loss rates 10^-5--3x10^-4 Msun/yr. The\ncorresponding mass range is 1.1--6.0 Msun assuming solar metallicity.\nConclusions. Contrary to the predictions of the evolutionary models, the\nluminosity distribution is continuous, with many O-rich AGB stars in the mass\nrange in which they should have been converted into C stars already. We suspect\nthat bulge AGB stars have higher than solar metallicity and therefore may avoid\nthe conversion to C-rich. The presence of low-mass stars in the sample shows\nthat their termination of the AGB evolution also occurs during a final phase of\nvery high mass-loss rate, leading to optically thick circumstellar shells.\n"]}]

A simultaneous description of the realistic\nevolution of the gaseous and solid components in a disk may provide a clue for\nsolving the problem of the mass concentration of the terrestrial planets in the\nsolar system. We simulate the formation of terrestrial planets from planetary\nembryos in a disk that evolves via magnetorotational instability and a disk\nwind. The aim is to examine the effects of a disk wind on the orbital evolution\nand final configuration of planetary systems. We perform N-body simulations of\nsixty 0.1 Earth-mass embryos in an evolving disk. The evolution of the gas\nsurface density of the disk is tracked by solving a one-dimensional diffusion\nequation with a sink term that accounts for the disk wind. We find that even in\nthe case of a weak disk wind, the radial slope of the gas surface density of\nthe inner disk becomes shallower, which slows or halts the type I migration of\nembryos. If the effect of the disk wind is strong, the disk profile is\nsignificantly altered (e.g., positive surface density gradient, inside-out\nevacuation), leading to outward migration of embryos inside ~ 1 AU. Disk winds\nplay an essential role in terrestrial planet formation inside a few AU by\nchanging the disk profile. In addition, embryos can undergo convergent\nmigration to ~ 1 AU in certainly probable conditions. In such a case, the\ncharacteristic features of the solar system's terrestrial planets (e.g., mass\nconcentration around 1 AU, late giant impact) may be reproduced.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Disk accretion onto weakly magnetized stars leads to the formation\nof a boundary layer (BL) where the gas loses its excess kinetic energy and\nsettles onto the star. There are still many open questions concerning the BL,\nfor instance the transport of angular momentum (AM) or the vertical structure.\nAims. It is the aim of this work to investigate the AM transport in the BL\nwhere the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is not operating owing to the\nincreasing angular velocity $\\Omega(r)$ with radius. We will therefore search\nfor an appropriate mechanism and examine its efficiency and implications.\nMethods. We perform 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations in a cylindrical\ncoordinate system $(r, \\varphi)$ for a thin, vertically inte- grated accretion\ndisk around a young star. We employ a realistic equation of state and include\nboth cooling from the disk surfaces and radiation transport in radial and\nazimuthal direction. The viscosity in the disk is treated by the\n{\\alpha}-model; in the BL there is no viscosity term included. Results. We find\nthat our setup is unstable to the sonic instability which sets in shortly after\nthe simulations have been started. Acoustic waves are generated and traverse\nthe domain, developing weak shocks in the vicinity of the BL. Furthermore, the\nsystem undergoes recurrent outbursts where the activity in the disk increases\nstrongly. The instability and the waves do not die out for over 2000 orbits.\nConclusions. There is indeed a purely hydrodynamical mechanism that enables AM\ntransport in the BL. It is efficient and wave mediated; however, this renders\nit a non-local transport method, which means that models of a effective local\nviscosity like the {\\alpha}-viscosity are probably not applicable in the BL. A\nvariety of further implications of the non-local AM transport are discussed.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

We also compare our findings with recent works in\nother slightly older star-forming regions to investigate possible differences\nin the accretion properties, but we find that the accretion properties for our\ntargets have the same dependence on the stellar and substellar parameters as in\nthe other regions. This leads us to conclude that we do not find evidence for a\ndifferent dependence of Macc with M* when comparing low-mass stars and BDs.\nMoreover, we find a similar small (1 dex) scatter in the Macc-M* relation as in\nsome of our recent works in other star-forming regions, and no significant\ndifferences in Macc due to different ages or properties of the regions.

We present an X-ray study of the supernova remnant SNR J0533-7202 in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and determine its physical characteristics\nbased on its X-ray emission. Methods. We observed SNR J0533-7202 with\nXMM-Newton (flare-filtered exposure times of 18 ks EPIC-pn and 31 ks\nEPIC-MOS1/MOS2). We produced X-ray images of the SNR, performed an X-ray\nspectral analysis, and compared the results to multi-wavelength studies.\nResults. The distribution of X-ray emission is highly non-uniform, with the\nsouth-west region brighter than the north-east. The X-ray emission is\ncorrelated with the radio emission from the remnant. We determine that this\nmorphology is likely due to the SNR expanding into a non-uniform ambient medium\nand not an absorption effect. We estimate the size to be 53.9 (\\pm 3.4) x 43.6\n(\\pm 3.4) pc, with the major axis rotated ~64 degrees east of north. We find no\nspectral signatures of ejecta and infer that the X-ray plasma is dominated by\nswept-up interstellar medium. Using the spectral fit results and the Sedov\nself-similar solution, we estimate an age of ~17-27 kyr, with an initial\nexplosion energy of (0.09-0.83) x 10^51 erg. We detected an X-ray source\nlocated near the centre of the remnant, namely XMMU J053348.2-720233.

We detected bright thermal X-ray emission from SNR J0533-7202\nand determined that the remnant is in the Sedov phase of its evolution.

The position of the\nH$_2$O ice line in the CPD, which is crucial for the formation of massive\nmoons, is computed at various solar distances. We assess the loss of Galilean\natmospheres due to high-energy radiation from the young Sun. Ganymede and\nCallisto cannot have accreted their H$_2$O during Jupiter's supposed GT,\nbecause its CPD (if still active) was too warm to host ices and much smaller\nthan Ganymede's contemporary orbit. From a thermal perspective, the Galilean\nmoons might have had significant atmospheres, but these would probably have\nbeen eroded during the GT in < $10^5$ yr by solar XUV radiation. Jupiter and\nthe Galilean moons formed beyond 4.5 (+/- 0.5) AU and prior to the proposed GT.\nThereafter, Jupiter's CPD would have been dry, and delayed accretion of\nplanetesimals should have created water-rich Io and Europa. While Galilean\natmospheres would have been lost during the GT, Titan would have formed after\nSaturn's own tack, because Saturn still accreted substantially for ~$10^6$ yr\nafter its closest solar approach, ending up at about 7 AU.\n","Comment: A&A Letter, 4 pages, 2 colored figures"]}]

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

This problem and the solution for it are well\nknown within the statistics community, but, apparently, not well known among\nsome of the physics community. The purpose of this note is didactic, to explain\nthe cause of the problem and the easy and elegant solution. The solution is to\nuse maximum likelihood instead of chi-square. The essential difference between\nthe two approaches is that maximum likelihood uses the normalization of each\nterm in the chi-square assuming it is a normal distribution, 1/sqrt(2 pi\nsigma-square). In addition, the normalization is applied to the theoretical\nexpectation not to the data. In the present note we illustrate what goes wrong\nand how maximum likelihood fixes the problem in a very simple toy example which\nillustrates the problem clearly and is the appropriate physics model for event\nhistograms.

The flux of\nenergy through scales implies the generation of small scales from larger ones,\nwhich is the fundamental reason for the irreversibility of the dynamics of\nturbulent flows. As we showed recently, this irreversibility manifests itself\nby an asymmetry of the probability distribution of the instantaneous power $p$\nof the forces acting on fluid elements. In particular, the third moment of $p$\nwas found to be negative. Yet, a physical connection between the\nirreversibility manifested in the distribution of $p$ and the energy flux or\nsmall-scale generation in turbulence has not been established. Here, with\nanalytical calculations and support from numerical simulations of fully\ndeveloped turbulence, we connect the asymmetry in the power distribution, {\\it\ni.e.}, the negative value of $\\langle p^3 \\rangle$, to the generation of small\nscales, or more precisely, to the amplification (stretching) of vorticity in\nturbulent flows.
