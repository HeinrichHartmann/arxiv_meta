In this geometry, the three fundamental physical dimensions\nlength, time, and mass are related in new kind of relativity. There are four\nconspicuous features of these models: 1) the speed of light and the\ngravitational constant are not constant, but vary with the evolution of the\nuniverse, 2) time has no beginning and no end; i.e., there is neither a big\nbang nor a big crunch singularity, 3) the spatial section of the universe is a\n3-sphere, and 4) in the process of evolution, the universe experiences phases\nof both acceleration and deceleration.

For\nexample crack front pinning by tougher places could increase the fracture\nresistance of multilayer structures, with interesting technological\napplications.

Heterogeneity has\nbeen demonstrated in tumor cells. Here, samples from blood of patients affected\nfrom colon tumor were analyzed and fished with a microfluidic assay based on\ngalactose active moieties, and incubated, for culturing, in SCID mice.\nFollowing the experimental investigation, a model based on Markov theory was\nimplemented and discussed to explain the equilibrium existing between\nphenotypes of subpopulations of cells sorted using the microfluidic assay. The\nmodel in combination with the experimental results had many implications for\ntumor heterogeneity. It displayed interconversion of phenotypes, as observed\nafter experiments. The interconversion generates of metastatic cells and\nimplies that targeting the CTCs will be not an efficient method to prevent\ntumor recurrence. Most importantly, understanding the transitions between cell\nphenotypes in cell population can boost the understanding of tumor generation\nand growth.\n"]}]

The analytical approximation for equation of state\nequation of state of Potekhin and Chabrier of fully ionized electron-ionic\nplasma was used for description of the ion-ion correlations (Coulomb\nnon-ideality) in combination with ``linear mixture'' (LM) approximation. Phase\nequilibrium for the charged species was calculated according to the\nGibbs-Guggenheim conditions. The presently considered BIM($\\sim$) model allows\nto calculate full set of parameters for phase boundaries of non-congruent\nvariant of phase equilibrium and to study all features for this non-congruent\nphase transition realization in Coulomb system in comparison with the simpler\n(standard) forced-congruent evaporation mode. In particular, in BIM($\\sim$)\nthere were reproduced two-dimensional remarkable (``banana-like'') structure of\ntwo-phase region $P-T$ diagram and the characteristic non-monotonic shape of\ncaloric phase enthalpy-temperature diagram, similar to the non-congruent\nevaporation of reactive plasma products in high-temperature heating with the\nuranium-oxygen system. The parameters of critical points (CP) line were\ncalculated on the entire range of proportions of ions $0<X<1$, including two\nreference values, when CP coincides with a point of extreme temperature and\nextreme pressure, $X_{T}$ and $X_{P}$.

However, few papers have used optimization techniques with\nguaranteed convergence in order to increase the efficiency of the passive\ncoupling of adjacent structures. In this paper, the combined problem of optimal\narrangement and mechanical properties of dampers placed between two adjacent\nbuildings is considered. A new bi-level optimization approach is presented. The\nouter-loop of the approach optimizes damper configuration and is solved using\nthe ``inserting dampers'' method, which was recently shown to be a very\neffective heuristic method. Under the assumption that the dampers have varying\ndamper coefficients, the inner-loop finds the optimal damper coefficients by\nsolving an $n$-dimensional optimization problem, where derivative information\nof the objective function is not available. Three different non-gradient\nmethods are compared for solving the inner loop: a genetic algorithm (GA), the\nmesh adaptive direct search (MADS) algorithm, and the robust approximate\ngradient sampling (RAGS) algorithm. It is shown that by exploiting this new\nbi-level problem formulation, modern derivative free optimization techniques\nwith guaranteed convergence (such as MADS and RAGS) can be used. The results\nindicate a great increase in the efficiency of the retrofitting system, as well\nas the existence of a threshold on the number of dampers inserted with respect\nto the efficiency of the retrofitting system.\n"]}]

First we investigate,\nin a model independent way, the constraints on the nonstandard Higgs couplings\nwith the fermions and the vector bosons in view of high energy unitarity and\nthe measured value of the Higgs to diphoton signal strength. Then we\nconcentrate on a particular BSM scenario, namely, the two Higgs-doublet models\n(2HDMs).
