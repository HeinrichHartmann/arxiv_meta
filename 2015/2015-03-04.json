The recently developed SMR, similarly to polarized neutron\nreflectometry (PNR), is an analytical tool for the determination of isotopic\nand magnetic structure of thin films and multilayers. It combines the\nsensitivity of M\\\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy to hyperfine interactions and the\ndepth selectivity of x-ray reflectometry. Specular reflection provides\ninformation on the depth profile, while off-specular scattering on the lateral\nstructure of scattering layers. Off-specular SMR and PNR intensity formulae of\na rather general multilayer with different domains, based on a Distorted\nIncident-Wave Approximation (DIWA) are presented. The Distorted-Wave Born\nApproximation (DWBA) results are given in an Appendix. Physical and numerical\nimplications, why using DIWA, are explained. The temporal character of SMR\nimposes specific differences between SMR and PNR. In order to reveal the limits\nof DIWA and to compare the two analytical methods, two-dimensional diffuse SMR\nand PNR maps of an antiferromagnetic multilayer are calculated and critically\ncompared.

For density dependent families\nof MCs that represent the interaction of large groups of identical objects,\nKurtz has proposed two kinds of approximations. One is based on ordinary\ndifferential equations, while the other uses a diffusion process. The\ncomputational cost of the deterministic approximation is significantly lower,\nbut the diffusion approximation retains stochasticity and is able to reproduce\nrelevant random features like variance, bimodality, and tail behavior. In a\nrecent paper, for particular stochastic Petri net models, we proposed a jump\ndiffusion approximation that aims at being applicable beyond the limits of\nKurtz's diffusion approximation, namely when the process reaches the boundary\nwith non-negligible probability. Other limitations of the diffusion\napproximation in its original form are that it can provide inaccurate results\nwhen the number of objects in some groups is often or constantly low and that\nit can be applied only to pure density dependent Markov chains. In order to\novercome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to apply the jump-diffusion\napproximation only to those components of the model that are in density\ndependent form and are associated with high population levels. The remaining\ncomponents are treated as discrete quantities. The resulting process is a\nhybrid switching jump diffusion. We show that the stochastic differential\nequations that characterize this process can be derived automatically both from\nthe description of the original Markov chains or starting from a higher level\ndescription language, like stochastic Petri nets.

The magnetic and charge properties of the different Co sites are\nhighly correlated with each other as their magnetic shift $K_{ZZ}$ scales\nlinearly with their quadrupolar frequency $nu_Q$. This reflects the fact that\nthe hole content on the Co orbitals varies from site to site.

Results: Type II-P supernovae produce dust grains of\nvarious chemical compositions and size distributions as a function of time. The\ngrain size distributions gain in complexity with time, are slewed towards large\ngrains, and differ from the usual MRN power-law distribution used for\ninterstellar dust.

Several dust components form in the ejecta and the total dust mass\ngradually builds up over a time span of 3 to 5 years post-outburst.

A projection from a low-level feature space to the semantic\nrepresentation space is learned from the auxiliary dataset and is applied\nwithout adaptation to the target dataset. In this paper we identify two\ninherent limitations with these approaches. First, due to having disjoint and\npotentially unrelated classes, the projection functions learned from the\nauxiliary dataset/domain are biased when applied directly to the target\ndataset/domain. We call this problem the projection domain shift problem and\npropose a novel framework, transductive multi-view embedding, to solve it. The\nsecond limitation is the prototype sparsity problem which refers to the fact\nthat for each target class, only a single prototype is available for zero-shot\nlearning given a semantic representation.

It effectively exploits\nthe complementary information offered by different semantic representations and\ntakes advantage of the manifold structures of multiple representation spaces in\na coherent manner.

Upon decreasing the temperature ($T <\nT_\\textup{C}^\\textup{Co}$), the magnetocrystalline anisotropy breaks up the FM\norder of Co by aligning the moments with the local easy axes of the various\ngrains, leading to a spin reorientation transition at\n$T_\\textup{R}^\\textup{Co}$. By applying a magnetic field,\n$T_\\textup{R}^\\textup{Co}$ monotonically decreases to lower temperatures, while\nthe $T_\\textup{N}^\\textup{Gd}$ is relatively robust against the external field.\nOn the other hand, the applied magnetic field pulls the magnetization of grains\nfrom the local easy direction to the field direction via a first-order\nreorientation transition, with the transition field ($H_\\textup{M}$) increasing\nupon cooling the temperature.\n","Comment: accepted by physical Review B 6 figures and 7 pages"]}]

In most of these applications, the number of parameters is\nlarge or perhaps even infinite. Thus, the development of numerical methods for\nthese parametric problems is faced with the possible curse of dimensionality.\nThis article is directed at (i) identifying and understanding which properties\nof parametric equations allow one to avoid this curse and (ii) developing and\nanalyzing effective numerical methodd which fully exploit these properties and,\nin turn, are immune to the growth in dimensionality. The first part of this\narticle studies the smoothness and approximability of the solution map, that\nis, the map $a\\mapsto u(a)$ where $a$ is the parameter value and $u(a)$ is the\ncorresponding solution to the PDE. It is shown that for many relevant\nparametric PDEs, the parametric smoothness of this map is typically holomorphic\nand also highly anisotropic in that the relevant parameters are of widely\nvarying importance in describing the solution. These two properties are then\nexploited to establish convergence rates of $n$-term approximations to the\nsolution map for which each term is separable in the parametric and physical\nvariables. These results reveal that, at least on a theoretical level, the\nsolution map can be well approximated by discretizations of moderate\ncomplexity, thereby showing how the curse of dimensionality is broken. This\ntheoretical analysis is carried out through concepts of approximation theory\nsuch as best $n$-term approximation, sparsity, and $n$-widths. These notions\ndetermine a priori the best possible performance of numerical methods and thus\nserve as a benchmark for concrete algorithms. The second part of this article\nturns to the development of numerical algorithms based on the theoretically\nestablished sparse separable approximations. The numerical methods studied fall\ninto two general categories. The first uses polynomial expansions in terms of\nthe parameters to approximate the solution map. The second one searches for\nsuitable low dimensional spaces for simultaneously approximating all members of\nthe parametric family. The numerical implementation of these approaches is\ncarried out through adaptive and greedy algorithms. An a priori analysis of the\nperformance of these algorithms establishes how well they meet the theoretical\nbenchmarks.\n"]}]

The hybrid shows good thermal stability up to\n400 C, beyond which the Au particles start migrating inside the SiO2 matrix.\nThis study provides an insight in the formation mechanism and thermal stability\nof the structures which are crucial factors for designing and applying such\nhybrids in fields of catalysis and biotechnology. As the method is general, it\ncan be applied to make similar hybrids based on SiO2 by tuning the reaction\nchemistry as needed.\n"]}]

Two different approaches in the framework of AQFT are\ndiscussed. On the one hand, an inverse scattering problem is considered. A\ngiven factorizing S-matrix is thereby taken as the starting point of the\nconstruction. The particle spectrum taken into account involves an arbitrary\nnumber of massive particle species, transforming under a global gauge group.\nStarting from known wedge-local auxiliary fields, the transition to local\ntheories is shown. To his end, we make use of the modular nuclearity condition\nand investigate certain maps from the wedge algebras, generated by the\nauxiliary fields, to the considered Hilbert space. Under a very plausible\nconjecture it is shown that these maps are nuclear, which implies the\nnontriviality of algebras associated with bounded regions in the sense that the\nReeh-Schlieder property holds. A large class of integrable models with\nfactorizing S-matrices in 1+1 dimensions can be constructed in this way. Among\nthem are the O(N)-invariant nonlinear sigma-models. Deformation techniques, on\nthe other hand, constitute a method of construction which may be applied in\narbitrary spacetime dimensions. This approach starts from a known quantum field\ntheoretic model which is subjected to a certain modification. Here, concretely,\nthe model of a scalar massive Fermion was deformed. The emerging models are\nbased on wedge-local fields, allowing for the computation of the two-particle\nS-matrix. The resulting scattering matrix depends on the deformation and\ndiffers from the one of the initial model. By restricting to 1+1 dimensions,\nthe deformation method yields a large class of integrable models with\nfactorizing S-matrices, including the Sinh-Gordon model.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, University of Vienna, 142 pages"]}]

One of\nthe fundamental parameters of the spiral structure is its angular velocity, or\npattern speed $\\Omega_p$, which determines the location of resonances in the\ndisc and the spirals' radial extent. The most direct method for estimating the\npattern speed relies on backward integration techniques, trying to locate the\nstellar birthplace of open clusters. Here we propose a new method based on the\ninteraction between the spiral arms and the stars in the disc. Using a sample\nof around 500 open clusters from the {\\it New Catalogue of Optically Visible\nOpen Clusters and Candidates}, and a sample of 500 giant stars observed by\nAPOGEE, we find $\\Omega_p = 23.0\\pm0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, for a local\nstandard of rest rotation $V_0=220$~km s$^{-1}$ and solar radius $R_0=8.0$~kpc.\nExploring a range in $V_0$ and $R_0$ within the acceptable values, 200-240 km\ns$^{-1}$ and 7.5-8.5 kpc, respectively, results only in a small change in our\nestimate of $\\Omega_p$, that is within the error. Our result is in close\nagreement with a number of studies which suggest values in the range 20-25 km\ns$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. An advantage of our method is that we do not need\nknowledge of the stellar age, unlike in the case of the birthplace method,\nwhich allows us to use data from large Galactic surveys. The precision of our\nmethod will be improved once larger samples of disk stars with spectroscopic\ninformation will become available thanks to future surveys such as 4MOST.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

The framework is constructed\nusing the new concept of a 'formal narrative' which is a sequence of cognitive\nstates inferred from sense data. First we propose that human cognition uses a\nhierarchy of narratives to predict changes in the natural and social\nenvironment. Each layer in the hierarchy represents a distinct 'view of the\nworld', but it also contributes to a global unitary perspective. Second, the\ngenerative models used for cognitive inference can create new narratives from\nthose states already experienced by an individual. We hypothesise that when a\nthreat is recognised, narratives are generated as a cognitive model of possible\nthreat scenarios. Using this framework, we suggest that OCD arises from a\ndysfunction in sub-surface levels of inference while the global unitary\nperspective remains intact. The failure of inference is felt as the external\nworld being 'not just right', and its automatic correction by the perceptual\nsystem is experienced as compulsion. Ordering and symmetry obsessions are the\neffects of the perceptual system trying to achieve precise inference. Checking\nbehaviour arises because the security system attempts to finesse inference as\npart of its protection behaviour. Similarly, fear of harm and distressing\nthoughts occur because the failure of inference results in an indistinct view\nof the past or the future. A wide variety of symptoms in OCD is thus explained\nby a single dysfunction.\n"]}]
