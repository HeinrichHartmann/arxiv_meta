To this end, we propose to\ncombine the characteristics of individual graph layers using tools from\nsubspace analysis on a Grassmann manifold. The resulting combination can then\nbe viewed as a low dimensional representation of the original data which\npreserves the most important information from diverse relationships between\nentities. We use this information in new clustering methods and test our\nalgorithm on several synthetic and real world datasets where we demonstrate\nsuperior or competitive performances compared to baseline and state-of-the-art\ntechniques. Our generic framework further extends to numerous analysis and\nlearning problems that involve different types of information on graphs.\n"]}]

Outer rings are mostly found in Hubble stages -1<=T<=4.\nInner rings are found in a distribution that covers the range -1<=T<=7. We\nconfirm that outer rings have two preferred orientations, parallel and\nperpendicular to the bar. We confirm a tendency for inner rings to be oriented\nparallel to the bar, but we find that a significant fraction (~50%) of them\nhave random orientations with respect to the bar. These misaligned inner rings\nare mostly found in late-type galaxies (T>=4). This may be due to spiral modes\ndecoupled from the bar dominating the Fourier amplitude spectrum at the radius\nof the inner ring.\n  We find that the fraction of barred galaxies hosting outer (inner) rings is\n~1.7 times (~1.3 times) that in unbarred galaxies.

We have used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)\nto identify and characterise a large sample of PMS objects in several\nstar-forming regions in the Magellanic Clouds, namely 30 Dor and the SN 1987A\nfield in the LMC, and NGC 346 and NGC 602 in the SMC, and have compared them to\nPMS stars in similar regions in the Milky Way, such as NGC 3603 and Trumpler\n14, which we studied with the HST and Very Large Telescope (VLT). We have\ndeveloped a novel method that combines broad-band (V, I) photometry with\nnarrow-band Halpha imaging to determine the physical parameters (temperature,\nluminosity, age, mass and mass accretion rate) of more than 3000 bona-fide PMS\nstars still undergoing active mass accretion. This is presently the largest and\nmost homogeneous sample of PMS objects with known physical properties and\nincludes not only very young objects, but also PMS stars older than 10 - 20 Myr\nthat are approaching the main sequence (MS). We find that the mass accretion\nrate scales roughly with the square root of the age, with the mass of the star\nto the power of 1.5, and with the inverse of the cube root of the metallicity.\nThe mass accretion rates for stars of the same mass and age are thus\nsystematically higher in the Magellanic Clouds than in the Milky Way. These\nresults are bound to have important implications for, and constraints on our\nunderstanding of the star formation process.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Frontier Research in\n  Astrophysics, Eds.
