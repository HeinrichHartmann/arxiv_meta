In Peacock's\napproximation, it is assumed that particles cross a shock front many times and\nenergy-gains for each step are fully uncorrelated. On the other hand,\ncorrelation of the distribution of an energy-gain factor for a particle is\nconsidered in Vietri's formulation. We examine how Peacock's approximation\ndiffers from Vietri's formulation. It is useful to know when we can use\nPeacock's approximation because Peacock's approximation is simple to derive the\npower-law index. In addition, we focus on how the variance of the energy-gain\nfactor has an influence on the difference between Vietri's formulation and\nPeacock's approximation. The effect of the variance has not been examined well\nuntil now. For demonstration, we consider two cases for the scattering in the\nupstream: the large-angle scattering (model A) and the regular deflection by\nlarge-scale magnetic fields (model B). Especially there is no correlation among\nthe distribution of an energy-gain factor for every step in model A. In this\nmodel, we see the power-law index derived from Peacock's approximation differs\nfrom the one derived from Vietri's formulation when we consider the\nmildly-relativistic shock, and the variance of the energy-gain factor affects\nthis difference. We can use Peacock's approximation for a non-relativistic\nshock and a highly-relativistic shock because the effect of the variance is\nhidden.

Using VLT-ISAAC\nnear-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of 39 zCOSMOS z~0.7 galaxies, we have measured\nHalpha and [NII] emission line fluxes for galaxies with [OII], Hbeta and [OIII]\navailable from VIMOS optical spectroscopy. The NIR spectroscopy enables us to\nbreak the degeneracy of the R23 method to derive unambiguously O/H gas\nmetallicities, and also SFRs from extinction corrected Halpha. Using, as a\nbenchmark, the position in the D4000 vs. [OIII]/Hbeta diagram of galaxies with\nreliable O/Hs from NIR spectroscopy, we were able to break the lower/upper\nbranch R23 degeneracy of additional 900 zCOSMOS z~0.7 galaxies. Additionally,\nthe Halpha-based SFR measurements were used to find the best SFR calibration\nbased on [OII] for the zCOSMOS z~0.7 galaxies without Halpha measurements. We\nfind a fraction of 19% of lower mass 9.5<logM/Msun<10.3 zCOSMOS galaxies which\nshows a larger evolution of the MZR relation, compared to higher mass galaxies,\nbeing more metal poor at a given mass by a factor of 2-3 compared to SDSS. This\nindicates that the low-mass MZR slope is getting steeper at z~0.7 compared to\nlocal galaxies. The existence of these metal-poor galaxies at z~0.7 can be\ninterpreted as the chemical version of galaxy downsizing. Moreover, the sample\nof zCOSMOS galaxies shows direct evidence that SFR influences the MZR at these\nredshifts. The comparison of the measured metallicities for the zCOSMOS sample\nwith the values expected for a non-evolving fundamental metallicity relation\n(FMR) shows broadly agreement, and reveals that also galaxies with lower\nmetallicities and typically higher (specific) SFRs, as found in our zCOSMOS\nsample at z~0.7, are in agreement with the predictions of a non-evolving\nZ(M,SFR).\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A; clarifying Appendix added"]}]

For hadronic\nmatter we select a relativistic mean-field equation of state with\ndensity-dependent couplings. Since the nucleons are treated in the\nquasi-particle framework, an excluded volume correction has been included for\nthe nuclear equation of state at suprasaturation density which takes into\naccount the finite size of the nucleons. Results: These novel aspects, excluded\nvolume in the hadronic phase and the higher-order repulsive interactions in the\nquark phase, lead to a strong first-order phase transition with large latent\nheat, i.e. the energy-density jump at the phase transition, which fulfils a\ncriterion for a disconnected third-family branch of compact stars in the\nmass-radius relationship. These twin stars appear at high masses ($\\sim$ 2\nM$_\\odot$) that are relevant for current observations of high-mass pulsars.\nConclusions: This analysis offers a unique possibility by radius observations\nof compact stars to probe the QCD phase diagram at zero temperature and large\nchemical potential and even to support the existence of a critical point in the\nQCD phase diagram.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astron. & Astrophys"]}]

We report the results of these continuum measurements, which combined\nwith archival data, allow us to build and analyse the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of the compact sources in SDC335.

Our goal is to achieve better insight\ninto the composition and evolution of evaporating very small grains (eVSGs) and\nPAHs through analyzing the infrared (IR) aliphatic and aromatic emission bands.\nWe combined spectro-imagery in the near- and mid-IR to study the spatial\nevolution of the emission bands in the prototypical PDR NGC 7023. We used\nnear-IR spectra obtained with AKARI to trace the evolution of the 3.3$\\mu$m and\n3.4$\\mu$m bands, which are associated with aromatic and aliphatic C-H bonds on\nPAHs. The spectral fitting involves an additional broad feature centred at\n3.45$\\mu$m. Mid-IR observations obtained with Spitzer are used to discriminate\nthe signatures of eVSGs, neutral and cationic PAHs. We correlated the spatial\nevolution of all these bands with the intensity of the UV field to explore the\nprocessing of their carriers. The intensity of the 3.45$\\mu$m plateau shows an\nexcellent correlation with that of the 3.3$\\mu$m aromatic band (correlation\ncoefficient R = 0.95), indicating that the plateau is dominated by the emission\nfrom aromatic bonds. The ratio of the 3.4$\\mu$m and 3.3$\\mu$m band intensity\n($I_{3.4}/I_{3.3}$) decreases by a factor of 4 at the PDR interface from the\nmore UV-shielded to the more exposed layers. The transition region between the\naliphatic and aromatic material is found to correspond spatially with the\ntransition zone between neutral PAHs and eVSGs. We conclude that the\nphoto-processing of eVSGs leads to the production of PAHs with attached\naliphatic sidegroups that are revealed by the 3.4$\\mu$m emission band.

Previous studies of NGC 2264 have shown\nthat similar photometric behavior is common among CTTS.\n  The goal of this work is to investigate the main causes of the observed\nphotometric variability of CTTS in NGC 2264 that present AA Tau-like light\ncurves, and verify if an inner disk warp could be responsible for their\nvariability. We investigate veiling variability in their spectra and u-r color\nvariations and estimate parameters of the inner disk warp using an occultation\nmodel proposed for AA Tau. We compare infrared and optical light curves to\nanalyze the dust responsible for the occultations. AA Tau-like variability is\ntransient on a timescale of a few years. We ascribe it to stable accretion\nregimes and aperiodic variability to unstable accretion regimes and show that a\ntransition, and even coexistence, between the two is common. We find evidence\nof hot spots associated with occultations, indicating that the occulting\nstructures could be located at the base of accretion columns. We find average\nvalues of warp maximum height of 0.23 times its radial location, consistent\nwith AA Tau, with variations of on average 11% between rotation cycles. We show\nthat extinction laws in the inner disk indicate the presence of grains larger\nthan interstellar grains.\n  The inner disk warp scenario is consistent with observations for all but one\nperiodic star in our sample. AA Tau-like systems comprise 14% of CTTS observed\nin NGC 2264, though this increases to 35% among systems of mass\n0.7M_sun<M<2.0M_sun.

While binary\norbits and stellar pulsations can provide much sharper constraints on the\nstellar mass, these methods are only rarely applicable to massive stars.\nUnfortunately, spectroscopic masses of massive stars heavily depend on the\ndetailed physics of model atmospheres. AIMS: We demonstrate the impact of a\nconsistent treatment of the radiative pressure on inferred gravities and\nspectroscopic masses of massive stars. Specifically, we investigate the\ncontribution of line and continuum transitions to the photospheric radiative\npressure. We further explore the effect of model parameters, e.g., abundances,\non the deduced spectroscopic mass. Lastly, we compare our results with the\nplane-parallel TLUSTY code, commonly used for the analysis of massive stars\nwith photospheric spectra. METHODS: We calculate a small set of O-star models\nwith the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) code using different approaches for the\nquasi-hydrostatic part. These models allow us to quantify the effect of\naccounting for the radiative pressure consistently. We further use PoWR models\nto show how the Doppler widths of line profiles and abundances of elements such\nas iron affect the radiative pressure, and, as a consequence, the derived\nspectroscopic masses. RESULTS: Our study implies that errors on the order of a\nfactor of two in the inferred spectroscopic mass are to be expected when\nneglecting the contribution of line and continuum transitions to the radiative\nacceleration in the photosphere. Usage of implausible microturbulent\nvelocities, or the neglect of important opacity sources such as Fe, may result\nin errors of approximately 50% in the spectroscopic mass.

This paper shows that both the magnitude and the direction of\nthe compensating flow force are incorrect if calculated from the textbook\nequation. A corrected analysis of the dynamic forces is presented that are in\nagreement with earlier experiments by this author. It follows that the\ncompensating flow force should be calculated from the static-pressure imbalance\non the spool profile. That is, not Newton but Pascal law should be applied to\ncalculate the compensating flow force.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 8 figures, ASME BATH 2015 Symposium"]}]

We argue that in the future\nobservatories will compete for astronomers to work with their data, that\nobservatories will have to reorient themselves to from providing good data only\nto providing an excellent end-to-end user-experience with all its implications,\nthat science-grade data-reduction pipelines will become an integral part of the\ndesign of a new observatory or instrument and that all this evolution will have\na deep impact on how astronomers will do science. We show how ALMA's design\nprinciples are in line with this paradigm.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 5 figures, published in the Proceedings of SPIE, vol. 9149,\n  914902 (2014)"]}]

The analysis highlights a number of key issues that should be kept in\nmind whenever equation of state data is compiled from nuclear physics for use\nin neutron star calculations. We provide explicit results for a particular\nstellar model and a specific nucleonic equation of state, making use of cooling\nsimulations to show how the local wave spectrum evolves as the star ages. Our\nresults show that the composition gradient is effectively dominated by the\nmuons whenever they are present. When the star cools below the superfluid\ntransition, the support for g-modes at lower densities (where there are no\nmuons) is entirely thermal. We confirm the recent suggestion that the g-modes\nin this region may be unstable, but our results indicate that this instability\nwill be weak and would only be present for a brief period of the star's life.\nOur analysis accounts for the presence of thermal excitations encoded in\nentrainment between the entropy and the superfluid component. Finally, we\ndiscuss the complete spectrum, including the normal sound waves and, in\nsuperfluid regions, the second sound.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 9 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

An\nexample of a classifier of this form is as follows: If X satisfies (x1 = 'blue'\nAND x3 = 'middle') OR (x1 = 'blue' AND x2 = '<15') OR (x1 = 'yellow'), then we\npredict that Y=1, ELSE predict Y=0. An attribute-value pair is called a literal\nand a conjunction of literals is called a pattern. Models of this form have the\nadvantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they produce a set of\nconditions that concisely describe a specific class. We present two\nprobabilistic models for forming a pattern set, one with a Beta-Binomial prior,\nand the other with Poisson priors. In both cases, there are prior parameters\nthat the user can set to encourage the model to have a desired size and shape,\nto conform with a domain-specific definition of interpretability. We provide\ntwo scalable MAP inference approaches: a pattern level search, which involves\nassociation rule mining, and a literal level search. We show stronger priors\nreduce computation.

Previous to this work, the only known way to transform\nunpredictability into a key that was $\\eps$ indistinguishable from having\nmin-entropy was via pseudorandomness, for example by Goldreich-Levin (GL)\nhardcore bits. This approach has the inherent limitation that from a source\nwith $k$ bits of unpredictability entropy one can derive a key of length (and\nthus HILL entropy) at most $k-2\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ bits. In many settings, e.g.\nwhen dealing with biometric data, such a $2\\log(1/\\epsilon)$ bit entropy loss\nin not an option. Our main technical contribution is a theorem that states that\nin the high entropy regime, unpredictability implies HILL entropy. The loss in\ncircuit size in this argument is exponential in the entropy gap $d$. To\novercome the above restriction, we investigate if it's possible to first\n\"condense\" unpredictability entropy and make the entropy gap small. We show\nthat any source with $k$ bits of unpredictability can be condensed into a\nsource of length $k$ with $k-3$ bits of unpredictability entropy. Our condenser\nsimply \"abuses\" the GL construction and derives a $k$ bit key from a source\nwith $k$ bits of unpredicatibily. The original GL theorem implies nothing when\nextracting that many bits, but we show that in this regime, GL still behaves\nlike a \"condenser\" for unpredictability. This result comes with two caveats (1)\nthe loss in circuit size is exponential in $k$ and (2) we require that the\nsource we start with has \\emph{no} HILL entropy (equivalently, one can\nefficiently check if a guess is correct). We leave it as an intriguing open\nproblem to overcome these restrictions or to prove they're inherent.\n","Comment: This is the full version of the paper published at ICALP 2015"]}]
