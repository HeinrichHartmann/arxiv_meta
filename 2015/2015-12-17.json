Directly getting offspring is the most basic form of fitness, but\nfitness can also be increased indirectly by helping genetically related\nindividuals (such as kin) to increase their fitness. The combined effect is\nknown as inclusive fitness. Here it is argued that a further elaboration of\nfitness has evolved, particularly in humans. It is called extensive fitness and\nit incorporates producing organisms that are merely similar in phenotype. The\nevolvability of this mechanism is illustrated by computations on a simple model\ncombining heredity and behaviour. Phenotypes are driven into the direction of\nhigh fitness through a mechanism that involves an internal estimate of fitness,\nimplicitly made within the organism itself. This mechanism has recently been\nconjectured to be responsible for producing agency and goals. In the model,\ninclusive and extensive fitness are both implemented by letting fitness\nincrease nonlinearly with the size of subpopulations of similar heredity (for\nthe indirect part of inclusive fitness) and of similar phenotype (for the\nphenotypic part of extensive fitness). Populations implementing extensive\nfitness outcompete populations implementing mere inclusive fitness. This occurs\nbecause groups with similar phenotype tend to be larger than groups with\nsimilar heredity, and fitness increases more when groups are larger.

Most of the stars in the Galactic centre are cool\nlate-type stars, but there are also >100 hot early-type stars in the central\nparsec of the Milky Way. These stars are only 3-8 Myr old. Our knowledge of the\nnumber and distribution of early-type stars in the Galactic centre is\nincomplete. Only a few spectroscopic observations have been made beyond a\nprojected distance of 0.5 pc of the Galactic centre. The distribution and\nkinematics of early-type stars are essential to understand the formation and\ngrowth of the nuclear star cluster. We cover the central >4pc^2 of the Galactic\ncentre using the integral-field spectrograph KMOS. We extracted more than 1,000\nspectra from individual stars and identified early-type stars based on their\nspectra. Our data set contains 114 bright early-type stars: 6 have narrow\nemission lines, 23 are Wolf-Rayet stars, 9 stars have featureless spectra, and\n76 are O/B type stars. Our wide-field spectroscopic data confirm that the\ndistribution of young stars is compact, with 90% of the young stars identified\nwithin 0.5 pc of the nucleus. We identify 24 new O/B stars primarily at large\nradii. We estimate photometric masses of the O/B stars and show that the total\nmass in the young population is >12,000M_sun. The O/B stars all appear to be\nbound to the Milky Way nuclear star cluster, while less than 30% belong to the\nclockwise rotating disk. The central concentration of the early-type stars is a\nstrong argument that they have formed in situ. A large part of the young O/B\nstars is not on the disk, which either means that the early-type stars did not\nall form on the same disk or that the disk is dissolving rapidly.

A general understanding for flexibility is not yet clearly\ndefined, leaving it to the reader to draw the right conclusions based on\nbackground information. The term flexibility is commonly defined as the ability\nto adapt to changes. For networks, flexibility would refer to the ability to\nadapt the available network resources, such as flows or topology, to changes of\ndesign requirements, e.g., shorter latency budgets or different traffic\ndistributions. Recent concepts such as Software Defined Networking, Network\nVirtualization and Network Function Virtualization have emerged claiming to\nprovide more flexibility in networks. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of\nwhat flexibility means and how it could be quantified to compare different\nnetwork designs remains open. In this paper, we ask whether flexibility can be\na new measure for network design space analysis. As it is quite challenging to\nformulate a flexibility measure that covers all network aspects, we propose an\ninitial set of flexibility aspects to start grounding guidelines. Our initial\nselection is backed up by an analysis of Software Defined Networking, Network\nVirtualization and Network Function Virtualization for their support of the\nselected flexibility aspects. Our research methodology is based on a systematic\napproach that leads to network design guidelines with respect to flexibility.\n"]}]

While this certainly enhances\nthe quality of the calibration, it makes it difficult to accommodate\nuser-imposed bounds on the model parameters such as restricting the market\npower parameters to the interval [0,1], which is a common requirement in\nconjectural variations approaches. We propose an algorithm to calibrate the\nsuppliers' sales and simultaneously deal with user-defined bounds on\nparameters. To this end, we fix the suppliers' sales at reference values and\nobtain the marginal costs for each supplier and market. We then limit the\nmarket power parameters to the interval [0,1], and calculate intervals of\nanchor prices and price elasticities that reproduce the reference supplier\nsales in the state of equilibrium. If these intervals do not contain the\nreference price elasticities and prices, we face a mismatch between reality and\nthe model mechanics. We resolve this by altering the reference sales for the\ncritical suppliers, and iterate. Thereby, the user controls whether price\nelasticities and anchor prices should be close to their reference values, or\nthe suppliers' sales. The algorithm is tested on data from the European gas\nmarket, and required less than one minute to identify calibrated parameters.\nOur algorithm is widely applicable, since it is based on mild (and common)\nunderlying assumptions and can be configured to suit a specific purpose thanks\nto the inclusion of user-defined bounds on all relevant parameters.\n"]}]

Also significant for physics is\nhis pioneering development of the quantification of entanglement in the\nearly-to-mid 1990s.
