In recent times, volumetric approaches in which the motion is captured\nfrom a number of cameras and a voxel-set representation of the body is built\nfrom the camera views, have gained ground due to attractive features such as\ninherent view-invariance and robustness to occlusions. Automatic, unsupervised\nsegmentation of moving bodies along entire sequences, in a temporally-coherent\nand robust way, has the potential to provide a means of constructing a\nbottom-up model of the moving body, and track motion cues that may be later\nexploited for motion classification. Spectral methods such as locally linear\nembedding (LLE) can be useful in this context, as they preserve \"protrusions\",\ni.e., high-curvature regions of the 3D volume, of articulated shapes, while\nimproving their separation in a lower dimensional space, making them in this\nway easier to cluster. In this paper we therefore propose a spectral approach\nto unsupervised and temporally-coherent body-protrusion segmentation along time\nsequences. Volumetric shapes are clustered in an embedding space, clusters are\npropagated in time to ensure coherence, and merged or split to accommodate\nchanges in the body's topology. Experiments on both synthetic and real\nsequences of dense voxel-set data are shown. This supports the ability of the\nproposed method to cluster body-parts consistently over time in a totally\nunsupervised fashion, its robustness to sampling density and shape quality, and\nits potential for bottom-up model construction\n","Comment: 31 pages, 26 figures"]}]

We establish that for all\nphysically well behaved normalizable inertial states, the correction terms\ndecay with the energy of the Rindler mode so that the high frequency limit is\ndominated by the thermal noise. However, inertial states which are not strictly\nnormalizable, lead to a constant contribution at all high frequencies in the\nRindler frame.

The environment is classified depending on its density\nas in previous works. We analyse the dynamical properties of void-centered\nspherical shells at different void-centric distances depending on this\nclassification. The above dynamical properties are given by the angular\ndistribution of the radial velocity field, its smoothness, the field dependence\non the tracer density and shape, and the field departures from linear theory.\nWe found that the velocity field in expanding voids follows more closely the\nlinear prediction, with a more smooth velocity field. However when using\nvelocity tracers with large densities such deviations increase. Voids with\nsizes around $18\\,h^{-1}\\,Mpc$ are in a transition regime between regions with\nexpansion overpredicted and underpredicted from linear theory. We also found\nthat velocity smoothness increases as the void radius, indicating the laminar\nflow dominates the expansion of larger voids (more than $18\\,h^{-1}\\,Mpc$). The\ncorrelations observed suggest that nonlinear dynamics of the inner regions of\nvoids could be dependent on the evolution of the surrounding structures.

In the\noverdamped limit, the skyrmion depins into a sliding state with a Hall angle of\nzero. When a Magnus term is included, the Hall angle is nonzero in the absence\nof a substrate. On a periodic substrate, the Hall angle varies with the drive\namplitude. Due to the substrate symmetry the Hall angle does not change\ncontinuously with drive, but forms a series of discrete steps at rational\nratios of the skyrmion velocity components perpendicular and parallel to the\ndrive direction, when the skyrmion motion locks to symmetry directions of the\nsubstrate for fixed intervals of the drive amplitude. On each step, the Hall\nangle is constant and the skyrmion motion is orderly. Transitions between\nlocked phases generate pronounced cusps in the velocity-force curves, as well\nas regions of negative differential mobility. The number of observable locking\nsteps increases when the relative strength of the Magnus term increases.

Second, for all $A\\! > \\!2$, the collapse is\nend-dominated. Third, before being swept up, the gas immediately ahead of an\nend-clump is actually accelerated outwards by the gravitational attraction of\nthe approaching clump, resulting in a significant ram pressure. For high aspect\nratio filaments the end-clumps approach an asymptotic inward speed, due to the\nfact that they are doing work both accelerating and compressing the gas they\nsweep up.

Copula-based Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT)\nfor censored data is proposed with both continuous and discrete messages\nreceived at the FC corresponding to different transmission strategies. We\naddress the computational issues of the copula-based GLRTs involving\nmultidimensional integrals by presenting more efficient fusion rules, based on\nthe key idea of injecting controlled noise at the FC before fusion. Although,\nthe signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is reduced by introducing controlled noise at\nthe receiver, simulation results demonstrate that the resulting noise-aided\nfusion approach based on adding artificial noise performs very closely to the\nexact copula-based GLRTs. Copula-based GLRTs and their noise-aided counterparts\nby exploiting the spatial dependence greatly improve detection performance\ncompared with the fusion rule under independence assumption.\n"]}]

One promising model for radio halos\nis Fermi-II acceleration of seed relativistic electrons by turbulence of the\nintracluster medium (ICM); Coulomb losses prohibit acceleration from the\nthermal pool.

Here, we integrate the Fokker-Planck equation of the cosmic ray (CR)\nelectron and proton distributions in a cosmological simulations of cluster\nformation. For standard assumptions, structure formation shocks lead to a seed\nelectron population which produces too centrally concentrated radio emission.\nInstead, we present three realistic scenarios that each can reproduce the\nspatially flat radio emission observed in the Coma cluster: (1) the ratio of\ninjected turbulent energy density to thermal energy density increase\nsignificantly with radius, as seen in cosmological simulations. This generates\na flat radio profile even if the seed population of CRs is steep with radius.\n(2) Self-confinement of energetic CR protons can be inefficient, and CR protons\nmay stream at the Alfven speed to the cluster outskirts when the ICM is\nrelatively quiescent. A spatially flat CR proton distribution develops and\nproduces the required population of secondary seed electrons. (3) The CR proton\nto electron acceleration efficiency K_ep ~ 0.1 is assumed to be larger than in\nour Galaxy (K_ep ~ 0.01), due to the magnetic geometry at the shock. The\nresulting primary electron population dominates. Due to their weaker density\ndependence compared to secondary electrons, these primaries can also reproduce\nradio observations.

Misrepair is a strategy of\nrepair for increasing the surviving chance of an organism in situations of\nsevere injuries; however a Misrepair alters the structure of a tissue, a cell\nor a molecule, which are the sub-structures of an organism. II. Alteration of\nthe structure of a sub-structure by Misrepair also alters the spatial\nrelationship between local sub-structures, and this change will lead to\nincreased damage-sensitivity and reduced repair-efficiency of these\nsub-structures. As a result, Misrepairs have a tendency to occur to the\nsub-structure and its neighbor sub-structures where an old Misrepair has taken\nplace. In return, new Misrepairs will increase again the damage-sensitivity of\nthese sub-structures and the surrounding sub-structures. The frequency of\nMisrepairs to these sub-structures is increased and the range of affected\nsub-structures is enlarged after each time of Misrepair in a vicious circle.\nThus, accumulation of Misrepairs is focalized and self-accelerating. III.\nFocalized accumulation of Misrepairs leads to formation and growing of a \"spot\"\nor \"plaque\" in a tissue. Growing of a spot is self-accelerating, and old spots\ngrow faster than new ones. New spots prefer to develop close to old ones,\nresulting in an in-homogenous distribution of spots.

The third\nchapter shows simulations of possible spectra of the comet's nucleus, which are\nuseful for both a comparison with real spectra, and for a planning of the\nobservations. Hapke's radiative transfer model is used to invert acquired data\nto infer physical properties. The fourth chapter introduces a method for\nspectral modeling.

The chiral anomaly, which plays a fundamental role in chiral gauge\ntheories, was predicted to be observable in crystals by Nielsen and Ninomiya in\n1983 [1]. Theoretical progress in identifying and investigating Dirac and Weyl\nsemimetals has revived strong interest in this issue [2-6]. In the Dirac\nsemimetal, the breaking of time-reversal symmetry by a magnetic field $\\bf B$\nsplits each Dirac node into two chiral Weyl nodes. If an electric field $\\bf E$\nis applied parallel to $\\bf B$, charge is predicted to flow between the Weyl\nnodes. We report the observation in the Dirac semimetal Na$_3$Bi of a novel,\nnegative and highly anisotropic magnetoresistance (MR). We show that the\nenhanced conductivity has the form of a narrowly defined plume that can be\nsteered by the applied field. The novel MR is acutely sensitive to deviations\nof $\\bf B$ from $\\bf E$, a feature incompatible with conventional transport.\nThe locking of the current plume to the field appears to be a defining\nsignature of the chiral anomaly.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures, based on a talk by NPO at APS March Meeting, San\n  Antonio, 2015"]}]
