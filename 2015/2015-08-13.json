In this paper we seek to explain the disappearance of\nquantum-mechanical reflection in the quasi-classical limit, using standard\nmethods of decoherence through environmental interaction. We consider two\nmodels. In the first, the incoming particle is classicalized by coupling it to\nan environment described by a standard Lindblad master equation diagonalizing\nin position. We find, however, that suppression of reflection is achieved only\nfor environmental interaction so strong that large fluctuations in momentum are\ngenerated which blurs the distinction between incoming and reflected wave\npackets. This negative conclusion also holds for a complex potential which has\nsimilar implications for attempts to understand the suppression of the Zeno\neffect using the same mechanism (discussed in more detail in another paper). A\ndifferent Lindblad master diagonalizing in momentum is shown to be successful\nin suppressing reflection without large fluctuations but such a master equation\nis unphysical. We consider a second model in which the barrier is modelled\nquantum-mechanically by a massive target particle coupled to an environment to\nmaintain it in a quasi-classical state. This avoids the fluctuations problem\nsince the incoming particle is not coupled to the environment directly. We find\nthat reflection is significantly suppressed as long as the decoherence\ntimescale of the target particle is much smaller than certain characteristic\nscattering timescales of the incoming particle, or equivalently, as long as the\nvelocity fluctuations in the target are larger than the velocity of the\nincoming particle.\n","Comment: 43 pages, Latex.

Ordering of the\nparticles in the chain is governed by single correlation parameter -- the\nprobability for two neighboring particles to have the same mass. As this\nparameter grows from zero to unity, the structure of the chain varies from\nregular staggering chain to completely random configuration, and then -- to\nvery long clusters of particles with equal masses. Therefore, this correlation\nparameter allows a control of typical cluster size in the chain. In order to\nexplore different regimes of the heat transport, two interatomic potentials are\nconsidered. The first one is an infinite potential wall, corresponding to\ninstantaneous elastic collisions between the neighboring particles. In\nhomogeneous chains such interaction leads to an anomalous heat transport. The\nother one is classical Lennard-Jones interatomic potential, which leads to a\nnormal heat transport. The simulations demonstrate that the correlated disorder\nof the particle arrangement does not change the convergence properties of the\nheat conduction coefficient, but essentially modifies its value. For the\ncollision potential, one observes essential growth of the coefficient for fixed\nchain length as the limit of large homogeneous clusters is approached. The\nthermal transport in these models remains superdiffusive. In the Lennard-Jones\nchain the effect of correlation appears to be not monotonous in the limit of\nlow temperatures.

The main difference with\nrespect to our previous models of massive stars is the adoption of a recent\nformalism accounting for the mass-loss enhancement when the ratio of the\nstellar to the Eddington luminosity, $\\Gamma_e$, approaches unity. With this\nnew formalism, the models are able to reproduce the Humphreys-Davidson limit\nobserved in the Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud colour-magnitude diagrams,\nwithout an ad hoc mass-loss enhancement. We also follow the predictions of\nrecent wind models indicating that the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss\nrates becomes shallower when $\\Gamma_e$ approaches unity. We thus find that the\nmore massive stars may suffer from substantial mass-loss even at low\nmetallicity. We also predict that the Humphreys-Davidson limit should become\nbrighter at decreasing metallicity. We supplement the evolutionary tracks with\nnew tables of theoretical bolometric corrections, useful to compare tracks and\nisochrones with the observations. For this purpose, we homogenize existing\nstellar atmosphere libraries of hot and cool stars (PoWR, ATLAS9 and Phoenix)\nand we add, where needed, new atmosphere models computed with WM-basic. The\nmass, age and metallicity grids are fully adequate to perform detailed\ninvestigations of the properties of very young stellar systems, both in local\nand distant galaxies.

In mesoscopic systems, however, the two-path\ninterference is easily smeared by contributions from other paths, and this\nmakes it difficult to observe the \\textit{true} transmission phase shift. To\neliminate this problem, multi-terminal Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometers have\nbeen used to derive the phase shift by assuming that the relative phase shift\nof the electrons between the two paths is simply obtained when a smooth shift\nof the AB oscillations is observed. Nevertheless the phase shifts using such a\ncriterion have sometimes been inconsistent with theory. On the other hand, we\nhave used an AB ring contacted to tunnel-coupled wires and acquired the phase\nshift consistent with theory when the two output currents through the coupled\nwires oscillate with well-defined anti-phase. Here, we investigate thoroughly\nthese two criteria used to ensure a reliable phase measurement, the anti-phase\nrelation of the two output currents and the smooth phase shift in the AB\noscillation. We confirm that the well-defined anti-phase relation ensures a\ncorrect phase measurement with a quantum two-path interference. In contrast we\nfind that even in a situation where the anti-phase relation is less\nwell-defined, the smooth phase shift in the AB oscillation can still occur but\ndoes not give the correct transmission phase due to contributions from multiple\npaths. This indicates that the phase relation of the two output currents in our\ninterferometer gives a good criterion for the measurement of the \\textit{true}\ntransmission phase while the smooth phase shift in the AB oscillation itself\ndoes not.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures"]}]

First, we examine the\nbehavior of persistent current in different branches of a zigzag carbon\nnanotube within a Hartree-Fock mean field approach using the second quantized\nformulation. The phase reversal of persistent current in several branches as a\nfunction of Hubbard interaction is found to exhibit interesting patterns. Our\nnumerical results suggest a filling-dependent metal-insulator transition in a\nzigzag carbon nanotube. Next, we address the behavior of persistent current in\nan ordered-disordered separated nanotube keeping in mind a possible\nexperimental realization of shell-doped nanowire which can provide a strange\nelectronic behavior rather than uniformly doped nanowires. Finally, we focus\nour attention on the behavior of persistent current in an open loop geometry\nwhere we clamp an ordered binary alloy ring between two ideal semi-infinite\nelectrodes to make an electrode-ring-electrode bridge. From our investigation\nwe propose that under suitable choices of the parameter values the system can\nact as a $p$-type or an $n$-type semiconductor.\n","Comment: A brief review article (19 pages, 27 figures)"]}]

Modeling phases -- during which software engineers\nanalyze requirements to the future system using some modeling language -- are\nan important part of the development process, since modeling errors are often\nhard to recognize and correct.\n  In this paper we present a framework which allows the integration of Answer\nSet Programming into the object-oriented software development process. OOASP\nsupports reasoning about object-oriented software models and their\ninstantiations. Preliminary results of the OOASP application in CSL Studio,\nwhich is a Siemens internal modeling environment for product configurators,\nshow that it can be used as a lightweight approach to verify, create and\ntransform instantiations of object models at runtime and to support the\nsoftware development process during design and testing.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication at LPNMR 2015"]}]

The corrections from\nflat space are given as a power series in $\\tau$ whose coefficients involve the\ncurvature at the centre of the diamond.

These results are also shown to\nhold in all spacetime dimensions. Formulae are also given, valid to next\nnon-trivial order, for causal domains in two spacetime dimensions.
