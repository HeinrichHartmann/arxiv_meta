Based on the analytic\nformulation of convolution in shapelet space, we construct a procedure to\nrecover the unconvolved shapelet coefficients under the assumption that the PSF\nis perfectly known. Using specific simulations, we test this approach and\ncompare it to other published approaches. We show that convolution in shapelet\nspace leads to a shapelet model of order $n_{max}^h = n_{max}^g + n_{max}^f$\nwith $n_{max}^f$ and $n_{max}^g$ being the maximum orders of the intrinsic\ngalaxy and the PSF models, respectively. Deconvolution is hence a\ntransformation which maps a certain number of convolved coefficients onto a\ngenerally smaller number of deconvolved coefficients. By inferring the latter\nnumber from data, we construct the maximum-likelihood solution for this\ntransformation and obtain unbiased shear estimates with a remarkable amount of\nnoise reduction compared to established approaches. This finding is\nparticularly valid for complicated PSF models and low $S/N$ images, which\nrenders our approach suitable for typical weak-lensing conditions.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 9 figures, submitted to A&A"]}]

We\npresent {\\em fully polynomial time randomized approximation schemes} (fpras) to\ncount $k$-Cliques and $k$-Independent sets in a random graph on $n$ vertices\nwhen $k$ is at most $(1+o(1))\\log n$, and $k$-Clique covers when $k$ is a\nconstant.

As an aside, we also obtain an alternate derivation of the closed form\nexpression for the $k$-th moment of a binomial random variable using our\ntechniques.

Long-range and static CuO6 tilt order with\northogonally inequivalent Cu-O bonds in the CuO2 planes in the low temperature\ntetragonal (LTT) phase is succeeded on warming through the low-temperature\ntransition by one with orthogonally equivalent bonds in the low temperature\northorhombic (LTO) phase.

However, as\npower systems are forced to operate closer to their technical limits, where\nflexible generation becomes scarce, the conventional market paradigm may not be\nable to respond effectively on the wide range of uncertainty. The operational\nflexibility of the power system depends both on the technical parameters of its\ncomponents, i.e., generators and transmission infrastructure, as well as on the\noperational practices that make optimal use of the available assets.

ARPES has been instrumental in establishing the anisotropic\nd-wave structure of the superconducting gap in high-transition temperature (Tc)\ncuprates, which is different from the conventional isotropic s-wave\nsuperconducting gap. Shortly afterwards, ARPES demonstrated that an anomalous\ngap above Tc, often termed the pseudogap, follows a similar anisotropy.

In contrast to its\nwell-known effect of improving the state of spatial order in the vortex matter,\nthe ac drive is surprisingly found to promote disorder by assisting the BG to\nVG transition to occur at a lower field value in this compound.
