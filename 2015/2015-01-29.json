The aim of this paper is twofold: first we discover isomorphisms\nbetween shearlet groups and other well-known groups, namely extended Heisenberg\ngroups and subgroups of the symplectic group. Interestingly, the connected\nshearlet group with positive dilations has an isomorphic copy in the symplectic\ngroup, while this is not true for the full shearlet group with all nonzero\ndilations.

These connections are examined in the second part of the\npaper. We describe how isomorphic groups with equivalent representations lead\nto isomorphic coorbit spaces. In particular we apply this result to square\nintegrable representations of the connected shearlet groups and metaplectic\nrepresentations of subgroups of the symplectic group.

Although statistical methods that have been developed for\nmicroarray data can be applied to RNA-Seq data, they are not ideal due to the\ndiscrete nature of RNA-Seq data. The Poisson distribution and negative binomial\ndistribution are commonly used to model count data. Recently, Witten (2011)\nproposed a Poisson linear discriminant analysis for RNA-Seq data. The Poisson\nassumption may not be as appropriate as negative binomial distribution when\nbiological replicates are available and in the presence of overdispersion\n(i.e., when the variance is larger than the mean). However, it is more\ncomplicated to model negative binomial variables because they involve a\ndispersion parameter that needs to be estimated. In this paper, we propose a\nnegative binomial linear discriminant analysis for RNA-Seq data. By Bayes'\nrule, we construct the classifier by fitting a negative binomial model, and\npropose some plug-in rules to estimate the unknown parameters in the\nclassifier. The relationship between the negative binomial classifier and the\nPoisson classifier is explored, with a numerical investigation of the impact of\ndispersion on the discriminant score. Simulation results show the superiority\nof our proposed method. We also analyze four real RNA-Seq data sets to\ndemonstrate the advantage of our method in real-world applications.\n"]}]

In the context of categorical quantum mechanics,\nCoecke and Kissinger suggested that two 3-qubit states, GHZ and W, may be used\nas the building blocks of a new graphical calculus, aimed at a diagrammatic\nclassification of multipartite qubit entanglement that would highlight the\ncommunicational properties of quantum states, and their potential uses in\ncryptographic schemes.\n  In this paper, we present a full graphical axiomatisation of the relations\nbetween GHZ and W: the ZW calculus. This refines a version of the preexisting\nZX calculus, while keeping its most desirable characteristics: undirectedness,\na large degree of symmetry, and an algebraic underpinning. We prove that the ZW\ncalculus is complete for the category of free abelian groups on a power of two\ngenerators - \"qubits with integer coefficients\" - and provide an explicit\nnormalisation procedure.\n","Comment: 12 pages"]}]

The effects of resolution broadening from multiple scattering\ndiminish with increasing muon momentum. As the momentum of the muon increases,\nthe contrast of the image goes down and therefore requires higher resolution in\nthe muon spectrometer to resolve the image. The variance of the measured muon\nmomentum reaches a minimum and then increases with increasing muon momentum.\nThe impact of the increase in variance is to require a higher integrated muon\nflux to reduce fluctuations.

The in-plane anisotropy is found to\naffect the angular dependence of the critical field. The ensemble of oriented\nbiaxial particles is theoretically described in the double-well potential\napproximation. Despite the biaxial magnetic anisotropy of particles, their\nensemble, if in the inhomogeneous state, is divided into two subensembles, with\nthe magnetic moments of particles being collinear in each of them.
