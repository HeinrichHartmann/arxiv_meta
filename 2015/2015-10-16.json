In order to preserve the\nnonlinear nature of the obstruction, asymptotic expansions in the low-Froude or\nlow-Bond number limits can be derived, but here, the solutions are waveless to\nevery order.

Feynman said they provide four of\nthe seven fundamental laws of classical Physics. However, Coulomb's law of\nelectrostatics and the Biot-Savart law of magnetostatics are used to justify\ntwo of the equations, an ad hoc addition of Maxwell's displacement current\ndensity term is used to complete the third equation, and the fourth is a\ndescription of Faraday's experimental data. This mixed approach has provided\nthe standard pedagogical introduction to these equations for more than a\ncentury. It leaves uncertain whether Maxwell's equations should be considered\naxioms. Here we show that all four of Maxwell's equations (including Faraday's\nLaw) can be derived by simultaneously solving Coulomb's law, the Biot-Savart\nlaw and the conservation of charge. We also derive generalised Maxwell's\nequations that in contrast to the standard forms, allow the creation of net\ncharge. We argue that Coulomb's law, and the Biot-Savart law rather than\nMaxwell's equations are a better choice of axioms for classical Physics and\nspeculate about the types of experiment that may provide evidence for the\nbreak-down of Maxwell's equations in their standard form.\n"]}]
