A main point is that two different concepts, number and number\nvalue are combined in the usual representations of number structures. This is\nvalid as long as just one structure of each number type is being considered. It\nis not valid when different structures of each number type are being\nconsidered. Elements of base sets of number structures, considered by\nthemselves, have no meaning. They acquire meaning or value as elements of a\nnumber structure. Fiber bundles over a space or space time manifold, M, are\ndescribed. The fiber consists of a collection of many real or complex number\nstructures and vector space structures. The structures are parameterized by a\nreal or complex scaling factor, s. A vector space at a fiber level, s, has, as\nscalars, real or complex number structures at the same level. Connections are\ndescribed that relate scalar and vector space structures at both neighbor M\nlocations and at neighbor scaling levels. Scalar and vector structure valued\nfields are described and covariant derivatives of these fields are obtained.\nTwo complex vector fields, each with one real and one imaginary field, appear,\nwith one complex field associated with positions in $M$ and the other with\nposition dependent scaling factors. A derivation of the covariant derivative\nfor scalar and vector valued fields gives the same vector fields. The\nderivation shows that the complex vector field associated with scaling fiber\nlevels is the gradient of a complex scalar field. Use of these results in gauge\ntheory shows that the imaginary part of the vector field associated with M\npositions acts like the electromagnetic field.

The calculated radius of gyration, showing dramatic\nvariations with pH, is in excellent agreement with scattering experiments. At\n$T_m$ Ub folds in a two-state manner at low and neutral pH. Clustering analysis\nof the conformations sampled in equilibrium folding trajectories at $T_m$, with\nmultiple transitions between the folded and unfolded states, show a network of\nmetastable states connecting the native and unfolded states. At low and neutral\npH, Ub folds with high probability through a preferred set of conformations\nresulting in a pH-dependent dominant folding pathway. Folding kinetics reveal\nthat Ub assembly at low pH occurs by multiple pathways involving a combination\nof nucleation-collapse and diffusion collision mechanism. The mechanism by\nwhich Ub folds is dictated by the stability of the key secondary structural\nelements responsible for establishing long range contacts and collapse of Ub.\nNucleation collapse mechanism holds if the stability of these elements are\nmarginal, as would be the case at elevated temperatures. If the lifetimes\nassociated with these structured microdomains are on the order of hundreds of\n$\\mu sec$ then Ub folding follows the diffusion-collision mechanism with\nintermediates many of which coincide with those found in equilibrium.

In particular, the semigroup of\ntransfer operators governing the finite time evolution of probability\ndistributions in phase space and its spectrum characterises both the relaxation\nrate of distributions to a statistical steady-state and the stability of this\nsteady-state to perturbations. If critical slowing down indeed occurs in the\napproach to an attractor crisis, the gap in the spectrum (between the leading\neigenvalue and the secondary ones) of the semigroup is expected to shrink.\n  Here we use a high-dimensional, chaotic climate model system in which a\ntransition from today's warm climate state to a snow-covered state occurs. This\ntransition is associated with the destruction of a chaotic attractor as the\nsolar constant is decreased. We show that critical slowing down develops in\nthis model before the destruction of the chaotic attractor and that it can be\nobserved from trajectories along the attractor.
