Case study: Neamt county, Romania"],"description":["  The paper aims to mapping the potential vulnerable areas to illegal dumping\nof household waste from rural areas in the extra- Carpathian region of Neamt\nCounty. These areas are ordinary in the proximity of built-up areas and buffers\nareas of 1 km were delimited for every locality. Based on various map layers in\nvector formats (land use, rivers, built-up areas, roads etc) an assessment\nmethod is performed to highlight the potential areas vulnerable to illegal\ndumping inside these buffer areas at local scale. The results are correlated to\nfield observations and current situation of waste management systems. The maps\noutline local disparities due to various geographical conditions of county.\nThis approach is a necessary tool in EIA studies particularly for rural waste\nmanagement systems at local and regional scale which are less studied in\ncurrent literature than urban areas.\n"]}]
