To compute this formula,\nthey first reduce the problem to counting the number of simultaneous embeddings\nof O_d1 and O_d2 into endomorphism rings of supersingular curves, and then\nsolve this counting problem.\n  Interestingly, this counting problem also appears when computing class\npolynomials for invariants of genus 2 curves. However, in this application, one\nmust consider orders O_d1 and O_d2 that are non-maximal. Motivated by the\napplication to genus 2 curves, we generalize the methods of Gross and Zagier\nand give a computable formula for v_p(J(d1,d2)) for any distinct pair of\ndiscriminants d1,d2 and any prime p>2. In the case that d1 is squarefree and d2\nis the discriminant of any quadratic imaginary order, our formula can be stated\nin a simple closed form. We also give a conjectural closed formula when the\nconductors of d1 and d2 are relatively prime.\n","Comment: 33 pages. Changed the abstract and made small changes to the\n  introduction.

When it tunnels\nthrough a barrier as a particle, its wave function collapses and it travels\nfaster than light. But superluminal propagation can only occur within the\ncoherence length, and the duration is constrained by uncertainty principle. On\nthe other hand, a particle with non-vanishing mass cannot travel faster than\nlight. So superluminal phenomena do not violate causality. We explain the\nprinciples of existing superluminal experiments and propose three types of\nexperiments to further verify superluminal phenomena.

The second demonstrates that superluminal phenomena can only occur\nwithin the coherence length.

CDM halos with V$_{max}$\n$<$ 30 km/s have inefficient star formation, and hence weak supernova feedback.\nAt a fixed 2 cm2/g SIDM cross section, the DM content of very low mass CDM and\nSIDM halos differs by no more than a factor of two within 100-200pc. At larger\nhalo masses ($\\sim$ 10$^{10}$ solar masses), the introduction of baryonic\nprocesses creates field dwarf galaxies with dark matter cores and central\nDM$+$baryon distributions that are effectively indistinguishable between CDM\nand SIDM. Both models are in broad agreement with observed Local Group field\ngalaxies across the range of masses explored. To significantly differentiate\nSIDM from CDM at the scale of faint dwarf galaxies, a velocity dependent cross\nsection that rapidly increases to values larger than 2 $cm^{2}/g$ for halos\nwith V$_{max}$ < 25-30 Km/s needs to be introduced.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 12 Figures, one Appendix, MNRAS in press.

A subjective visual property is useful\neither on its own (e.g. image and video interestingness) or as an intermediate\nrepresentation for visual recognition (e.g. a relative attribute). Due to its\nambiguous nature, annotating the value of a subjective visual property for\nlearning a prediction model is challenging. To make the annotation more\nreliable, recent studies employ crowdsourcing tools to collect pairwise\ncomparison labels because human annotators are much better at ranking two\nimages/videos (e.g. which one is more interesting) than giving an absolute\nvalue to each of them separately. However, using crowdsourced data also\nintroduces outliers. Existing methods rely on majority voting to prune the\nannotation outliers/errors.

Differing from existing methods, the\nproposed method integrates local pairwise comparison labels together to\nminimise a cost that corresponds to global inconsistency of ranking order.

A novel,\npractical model based on GOK-DFT for the calculation of electronic excitation\nenergies is discussed. The new model relies on two modifications of GOK-DFT:\nuse of range separation and use of the slope of the linearly-interpolated\nensemble energy, rather than orbital energies. The range-separated approach is\nappealing as it enables the rigorous formulation of a multi-determinant\nstate-averaged DFT method. In the exact theory, the short-range density\nfunctional, that complements the long-range wavefunction-based ensemble energy\ncontribution, should vary with the ensemble weights even when the density is\nheld fixed. This weight dependence ensures that the range-separated ensemble\nenergy varies linearly with the ensemble weights. When the (weight-independent)\nground-state short-range exchange-correlation functional is used in this\ncontext, curvature appears thus leading to an approximate weight-dependent\nexcitation energy. In order to obtain unambiguous approximate excitation\nenergies, we propose to interpolate linearly the ensemble energy between\nequiensembles.

We give a criterion for\npredicates that often yields efficient refutation algorithms at much lower\ndensities. Specifically, if $P$ fails to support a $t$-wise uniform\ndistribution, then there is an efficient algorithm that refutes random CSP$(P)$\ninstances $I$ whp when $m \\gg n^{t/2}$. Indeed, our algorithm will \"somewhat\nstrongly\" refute $I$, certifying $\\mathrm{Opt}(I) \\leq 1-\\Omega_k(1)$, if $t =\nk$ then we get the strongest possible refutation, certifying $\\mathrm{Opt}(I)\n\\leq \\mathrm{E}[P] + o(1)$. This last result is new even in the context of\nrandom $k$-SAT. Regarding the optimality of our $m \\gg n^{t/2}$ requirement,\nprior work on SDP hierarchies has given some evidence that efficient refutation\nof random CSP$(P)$ may be impossible when $m \\ll n^{t/2}$. Thus there is an\nindication our algorithm's dependence on $m$ is optimal for every $P$, at least\nin the context of SDP hierarchies. Along these lines, we show that our\nrefutation algorithm can be carried out by the $O(1)$-round SOS SDP hierarchy.\nFinally, as an application of our result, we falsify assumptions used to show\nhardness-of-learning results in recent work of Daniely, Linial, and\nShalev-Shwartz.\n"]}]

However, the variation of\nsubspaces can grow exponentially in the data dimensionality. This can cause\nserious consumption of the privacy budget.

We establish our\nresults via certain properties of the null space of the measurement map. In the\nsetting where the measurements are realized as Frobenius inner products with\nindependent standard Gaussian random matrices we show that $10 r (n_1 + n_2)$\nmeasurements are enough to uniformly and stably recover an $n_1 \\times n_2$\nmatrix of rank at most $r$.

It is widely used\nin recording devices or as a catalyst [1, 2], and some of its electronic and\nmagnetic properties hold promise for future applications [3]. Magnetite\nundergoes a structural phase transition (PT) accompanied by a Metal-Insulator\nTransition (MIT) below 120 K, which was originally proposed by Verwey to be\ndriven by the onset of a periodic modulation of the charge on the iron sites\n[4]. While the pattern of the charge ordering has been shown to be far more\ncomplex than the original Verwey hypothesis [5, 6], the mechanism behind its\nformation is still a subject of debate. As an alternative to a purely\nelectronic model, the interplay between structural and electronic degrees of\nfreedom has been proposed to drive the MIT [7, 8]. However, direct evidence for\nthe involvement of the structure has never been obtained, since no clear\nanomalies of any phonon mode have been observed across the critical region.\nHere, we reveal by means of ultrafast broadband optical spectroscopy and\nspontaneous Raman scattering that the primary order parameters of the\nstructural PT are strongly coupled to the charge density wave, and undergo a\nsizable softening in the proximity of the critical temperature. Furthermore, we\nshow that signatures of the low-temperature phase can be induced by impulsive\ncharge transfer excitation even at room temperature, where fluctuations of the\ncharge order have recently been shown to persist [9].

Therefore, as a first step in any attempt at an analogous description\nof many-quark systems, it is necessary to know the two-quark correlation. With\nthis in mind, we study the light quark distribution in a heavy-light meson with\na static heavy quark. The charge and matter radial distributions of these\nheavy-light mesons are measured on a lattice with a light quark mass about that\nof the strange quark. Both distributions can be well fitted upto r approx 0.7\nfm with the exponential form w_i^2(r), where w_i(r)=A exp(-r/r_i). For the\ncharge(c) and matter(m) distributions r_c approx 0.32(2) fm and r_m \\approx\n0.24(2) fm. We also discuss the normalisation of the total charge (defined to\nbe unity in the continuum limit) and matter integrated over all space, finding\n1.30(5) and 0.4(1) respectively for a lattice spacing approx 0.17 fm.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 3 ps figures"]}]
