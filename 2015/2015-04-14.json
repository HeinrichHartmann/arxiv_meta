In particular, a\nnumber of phenomena or observables have been identified as sensitive probes to\nthe density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy. Experimental studies\nhave confirmed some of these interesting isospin-dependent effects and allowed\nus to constrain relatively stringently the symmetry energy at sub-saturation\ndensities. The impacts of this constrained density dependence of the symmetry\nenergy on the properties of neutron stars have also been studied, and they were\nfound to be very useful for the astrophysical community. With new opportunities\nprovided by the various radioactive beam facilities being constructed around\nthe world, the study of isospin physics is expected to remain one of the\nforefront research areas in nuclear physics. In this report, we review the\nmajor progress achieved during the last decade in isospin physics with heavy\nion reactions and discuss future challenges to the most important issues in\nthis field.\n","Comment: 281 pages including 163 figures.

Our analysis is based on a\nmulti type branching process: We model individual cells which can either divide\nor undergo apoptosis. In case of a cell division, the two daughter cells can\nmutate, which potentially confers a change in fitness to the cell. In contrast\nto previous models, the change in fitness induced by the driver mutation\ndepends on the genetic context of the cell, in our case on the number of\npassenger mutations. The passenger mutations themselves have no or only a very\nsmall impact on the cell's fitness. While our model is not designed as a\nspecific model for a particular cancer, the underlying idea is motivated by\nclinical and experimental observations in Burkitt Lymphoma. In this tumor, the\nhallmark mutation leads to deregulation of the MYC oncogene which increases the\nrate of apoptosis, but also the proliferation rate of cells. This increase in\nthe rate of apoptosis hence needs to be overcome by mutations affecting\napoptotic pathways, naturally leading to an epistatic fitness landscape. This\nmodel shows a very interesting dynamical behavior which is distinct from the\ndynamics of cancer initiation in the absence of epistasis.

Two notions have received particular attention: trophic groups, which\nhave been used for decades in the ecological literature, and more recently,\nmodules. The relationship between these two group definitions remains unknown\nin empirical food webs because they have so far been studied separately. While\nrecent developments in network theory have led to efficient methods for\ndetecting modules in food webs, the determination of trophic groups (sets of\nspecies that are functionally similar) is based on subjective expert knowledge.\nHere, we develop a novel algorithm for trophic group detection.

Furthermore, we reveal a 2-level hierarchical\nstructure where modules partition food webs into large bottom-top trophic\npathways whereas trophic groups further partition these pathways into sets of\nspecies with similar trophic connections. Bringing together trophic groups and\nmodules provides new perspectives to the study of dynamical and functional\nconsequences of food-web structure, bridging topological analysis and dynamical\nsystems.

The theorem states that given a set of vectors $X$\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for every vector in the convex hull of $X$ there exists an\n$\\varepsilon$-close (under the $p$-norm distance, for $2\\leq p < \\infty$)\nvector that can be expressed as a convex combination of at most $b$ vectors of\n$X$, where the bound $b$ depends on $\\varepsilon$ and the norm $p$ and is\nindependent of the dimension $d$.

However, in this paper we present a self-contained\nproof of this result.\n  Using this theorem we establish that in a bimatrix game with $ n \\times n$\npayoff matrices $A, B$, if the number of non-zero entries in any column of\n$A+B$ is at most $s$ then an $\\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium of the game can be\ncomputed in time $n^{O\\left(\\frac{\\log s }{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)}$. This, in\nparticular, gives us a polynomial-time approximation scheme for Nash\nequilibrium in games with fixed column sparsity $s$. Moreover, for arbitrary\nbimatrix games---since $s$ can be at most $n$---the running time of our\nalgorithm matches the best-known upper bound, which was obtained by Lipton,\nMarkakis, and Mehta (2003).\n  The approximate Carath\\'{e}odory's theorem also leads to an additive\napproximation algorithm for the normalized densest $k$-subgraph problem.

We\nprove that for LDPC codes, even if we include all redundant checks,\nasymptotically there is no gain in the LP decoder threshold on the BSC under\ncertain conditions on the base Tanner graph. First, we show that if the graph\nhas bounded check-degree and satisfies a condition which we call asymptotic\nstrength, then including high degree redundant checks in the LP does not\nsignificantly improve the threshold in the following sense: for each constant\ndelta>0, there is a constant k>0 such that the threshold of the LP decoder\ncontaining all redundant checks of degree at most k improves by at most delta\nupon adding to the LP all redundant checks of degree larger than k. We conclude\nthat if the graph satisfies a rigidity condition, then including all redundant\nchecks does not improve the threshold of the base LP.

Recently, some\nresearchers try to utilize latent topics of certain granularity to preserve\nsemantic similarity in hash codes beyond keyword matching. However, topics of\ncertain granularity are not adequate to represent the intrinsic semantic\ninformation. In this paper, we present a novel unified approach for short text\nHashing using Multi-granularity Topics and Tags, dubbed HMTT. In particular, we\npropose a selection method to choose the optimal multi-granularity topics\ndepending on the type of dataset, and design two distinct hashing strategies to\nincorporate multi-granularity topics. We also propose a simple and effective\nmethod to exploit tags to enhance the similarity of related texts.

The RDS does not survive the transition from\nthe core to the thick wind when the wind close to the core is not sufficiently\ndense to compensate for the $r^{-2}$ dilution of photons due to shock\ncurvature.

The energy functional\nand constraint are discretized by either the finite difference, or sine or\nFourier pseudospectral discretization schemes and thus the original infinite\ndimensional nonconvex minimization problem is approximated by a finite\ndimensional constrained nonconvex minimization problem. Then an initial\nsolution is first constructed by using a feasible gradient type method, which\nis an explicit scheme and maintains the spherical constraint automatically. To\naccelerate the convergence of the gradient type method, we approximate the\nenergy functional by its second-order Taylor expansion with a regularized term\nat each Newton iteration and adopt a cascadic multigrid technique for selecting\ninitial data. It leads to a standard trust-region subproblem and we solve it\nagain by the feasible gradient type method.

We adapt recent randomized\nlow-rank approximation algorithms to provide an efficient solution to principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA), and we use this efficient solver to improve parameter\nestimation in large-scale linear mixed models (LMM) for association mapping in\nstatistical and quantitative genomics. A key observation in this paper is that\nrandomization serves a dual role, improving both computational and statistical\nperformance by implicitly regularizing the covariance matrix estimate of the\nrandom effect in a LMM. These statistical and computational advantages are\nhighlighted in our experiments on simulated data and large-scale genomic\nstudies.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1211.1642"]}]

We provide bounds on certain properties of the network based on the\nprobabilities of infection of each node in it when it reaches the steady state.\nFinally, we provide extensive experimental results that verify our theoretical\nresults and at the same time provide more insight on the problem.\n"]}]

The quantum leaped outgoing propagators are\ndetermined and break locally the energy and the charge. Like to the\nteleportation the entangled pairs are here the b quark and the Goldstino. The\ndominant stop production is from gluons. The stop-antistop pair decay to\nquantum leaped b (c or t) quark, and the decay break the color. I get for the\n(color breaking) quantum leap: 10^-18 m !!! And 10^-11 m color breaking would\nbe needed for a color breaking chain reaction. The open question is: Are the\ncolliders going to produce supersymmetry charge? Because some charges in QGP\ncan make long color breaking and a chain reaction.\n  A long color broken QGP state in the re-Big Bang theory could explain the\nnear infinite energy and the near infinite mass of the universe: - at first was\nrandom color QGP in the flat space-time, - at twice the color restoration in\nthe curved space-time, which eats the Goldstinos, - and finally the baryon\ngenesis.
