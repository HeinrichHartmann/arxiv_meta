In\ncontrast to past studies on this subject, we do not restrict to the case where\nthese gerbes are torsion or topologically trivial. We give an Appell-Humbert\ntype description of all holomorphic gerbes on complex tori. This gives an\nexplicit, simple, cocycle representative (and hence gerbe) for each equivalence\nclass of holomorphic gerbes. We also prove that a gerbe on the fiber product of\nfour spaces over a common base is trivial as long as it is trivial upon\nrestriction to any three out of the four spaces. A fine moduli stack for gerbes\non complex tori is constructed. This involves the construction of a\n'Poincar\\'e' gerbe which plays a role analogous to the role of the Poincar\\'e\nbundle in the case of line bundles.\n","Comment: 33 pages, comments appreciated"]}]

Coevality of each cluster and membership\nof the newly-discovered B[e] objects are investigated using our observations as\nwell as literature data of the surroundings. Infrared excess and narrow-band\nphotometric properties of the B[e] stars are also studied. We confirm and\nclassify 22 new cluster members, including Wolf-Rayet stars and blue\nhypergiants. Spectral types (O9-B1.5 V) and radial velocities of B[e] objects\nare compatible with the remaining cluster members, while emission features of\nMg II, Fe II], and [Fe II] are identified in their spectra. The ages of these\nstars are 4.5 and 6 Myr, and they show mild infrared excesses. We confirm the\npresence of FS CMa stars in the coeval populations of Mercer 20 and Mercer 70.\nWe discuss the nature and evolutionary state of FS CMa stars, discarding a\npost-AGB nature and introducing a new hypothesis about mergers.

Therefore, the LTE macro-cell occupancy is empirically\nmodeled using exponential distributions mixture. The LTE cognitive femto-cell\ndownlink throughput is maximized by compromising the transmission efficiency,\nthe explored spectrum opportunities and the interference from the macro-cell.\nAn analytical solution for the optimal periodic sensing interval that maximizes\nthe throughput is found and verified by simulations. The obtained results show\nthat there is indeed a single periodic sensing interval value that maximizes\nthe LTE cognitive femto-cell downlink throughput. At the peak of the macro-cell\ntraffic, our framework increases the femto-cell throughput by around 15%\ncompared to the senseless case.

We show that an operator $x$ in the unit sphere of\n$E\\left(\\mathcal{M},\\tau\\right)$ is $k$-extreme, $k\\in\\mathbb N$, whenever its\nsingular value function $\\mu(x)$ is $k$-extreme and one of the following\nconditions hold (i) $\\mu(\\infty,x)=\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}\\mu(t,x)=0$ or (ii)\n$n(x)\\mathcal{M} n(x^*)=0$ and $|x|\\geq \\mu(\\infty,x)s(x)$, where $n(x)$ and\n$s(x)$ are null and support projections of $x$, respectively. The converse is\ntrue whenever $\\mathcal{M}$ is non-atomic. The global $k$-rotundity property\nfollows, that is if $\\mathcal{M}$ is non-atomic then $E$ is $k$-rotund if and\nonly if $E\\left(\\mathcal{M},\\tau\\right)$ is $k$-rotund. As a consequence of the\nnoncommutive results we obtain that $f$ is a $k$-extreme point of the unit ball\nof the strongly symmetric function space $E$ if and only if its decreasing\nrearrangement $\\mu(f)$ is $k$-extreme and $|f|\\geq \\mu(\\infty,f)$.
