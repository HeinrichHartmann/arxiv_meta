Whenever the whole structure of a network\nis unknown, one must resort to reconstruction methods that identify the least\nbiased ensemble of networks consistent with the partial information available.\nA challenging case, frequently encountered due to privacy issues in the\nanalysis of interbank flows and Big Data, is when there is only local\n(node-specific) aggregate information available. For binary networks, the\nrelevant ensemble is one where the degree (number of links) of each node is\nconstrained to its observed value. However, for weighted networks the problem\nis much more complicated. While the naive approach prescribes to constrain the\nstrengths (total link weights) of all nodes, recent counter-intuitive results\nsuggest that in weighted networks the degrees are often more informative than\nthe strengths. This implies that the reconstruction of weighted networks would\nbe significantly enhanced by the specification of both strengths and degrees, a\ncomputationally hard and bias-prone procedure. Here we solve this problem by\nintroducing an analytical and unbiased maximum-entropy method that works in the\nshortest possible time and does not require the explicit generation of\nreconstructed samples. We consider several real-world examples and show that,\nwhile the strengths alone give poor results, the additional knowledge of the\ndegrees yields accurately reconstructed networks. Information-theoretic\ncriteria rigorously confirm that the degree sequence, as soon as it is\nnon-trivial, is irreducible to the strength sequence.

Under this\nformulation, the turbulent velocity field is expressed as a linear\nsuperposition of propagating modes, identified via a gain-based decomposition\nof the Navier-Stokes equations. Compliant surfaces, modeled as a complex\nwall-admittance linking pressure and velocity, affect the gain and structure of\nthese modes. With minimal computation, this framework accurately predicts the\nemergence of the quasi-2D propagating waves observed in recent direct numerical\nsimulations. Further, the analysis also enables the rational design of\ncompliant surfaces, with properties optimized to suppress flow structures\nenergetic in wall turbulence. It is shown that walls with unphysical negative\ndamping are required to interact favorably with modes resembling the energetic\nnear-wall cycle, which could explain why previous studies have met with limited\nsuccess. Positive-damping walls are effective for modes resembling the\nso-called very large-scale motions (VLSMs), indicating that compliant surfaces\nmay be better suited for application at higher Reynolds number.

These 50 stars were selected from the solar-type\nsuperflare stars that we had discovered from the Kepler data. More than half\n(34 stars) of these 50 target superflare stars show no evidence of binarity,\nand we estimated stellar parameters of these 34 stars in our previous study\n(Notsu et al. 2015, hereafter called Paper I). According to our previous\nstudies using Kepler data, superflare stars show quasi-periodic brightness\nvariations whose amplitude (0.1-10\\%) is much larger than that of the solar\nbrightness variations (0.01-0.1\\%) caused by the existence of sunspots on the\nrotating solar surface. In this study, we investigated whether these\nquasi-periodic brightness variations of superflare stars are explained by the\nrotation of a star with fairly large starspots, by using stellar parameters\nderived in Paper I. First, we confirmed that the value of the projected\nrotational velocity $v \\sin i$ is consistent with the rotational velocity\nestimated from the period of the brightness variation. Next, we measured the\nintensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines and H$\\alpha$ line, good indicators\nof the stellar chromospheric activity, and compared them with other stellar\nproperties. The intensity of Ca II infrared triplet lines indicates that the\nmean magnetic field strength ($\\langle fB\\rangle$) of the target superflare\nstars can be higher than that of the Sun. A correlation between the amplitude\nof the brightness variation and the intensity of Ca II triplet line was found.\nAll the targets expected to have large starspots because of their large\namplitude of the brightness variation show high chromospheric activities\ncompared to the Sun.

Introduction.\nAdvanced image and video editing techniques are increasingly common in the\nimage processing and computer vision world, and are also starting to be used in\nmedia entertainment. One common and difficult task closely linked to the world\nof video editing is image and video \" inpainting \". Generally speaking, this is\nthe task of replacing the content of an image or video with some other content\nwhich is visually pleasing. This subject has been extensively studied in the\ncase of images, to such an extent that commercial image inpainting products\ndestined for the general public are available, such as Photoshop's \" Content\nAware fill \" [1]. However, while some impressive results have been obtained in\nthe case of videos, the subject has been studied far less extensively than\nimage inpainting. This relative lack of research can largely be attributed to\nhigh time complexity due to the added temporal dimension. Indeed, it has only\nvery recently become possible to produce good quality inpainting results on\nhigh definition videos, and this only in a semi-automatic manner. Nevertheless,\nhigh-quality video inpainting has many important and useful applications such\nas film restoration, professional post-production in cinema and video editing\nfor personal use. For this reason, we believe that an automatic, generic video\ninpainting algorithm would be extremely useful for both academic and\nprofessional communities.\n"]}]

A blind deconvolution problem is severely\nill-posed and, in order to reduce the extremely large number of possible\nsolutions, it is necessary to introduce sensible constraints on both the\nscientific target and the PSF. In a previous paper we proposed a sound\nmathematical approach based on a suitable inexact alternating minimization\nstrategy for minimizing the generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence, assuring\nglobal convergence. In the framework of this method we showed that an important\nconstraint on the PSF is the upper bound which can be derived from the\nknowledge of its Strehl ratio.

We show that the Weil descent to F_2 of S_3\nfor ordinary curves in general has first fall degree 2, which is much lower\nthan expected. The reason is the existence of a group morphism to F_2 which\ngives a linear polynomial after Weil descent.

Second, a\ncomplete set of annotations for those `visual actions', composed of\nsubject-object and associated verb, which we call COCO-a (a for `actions').\nCOCO-a is larger than existing action datasets in terms of number of actions\nand instances of these actions, and is unique because it is data-driven, rather\nthan experimenter-biased. Other unique features are that it is exhaustive, and\nthat all subjects and objects are localized.

Second, the research provides a\ncomparison of the number of files which can be recovered from different\nversions of cloud storage applications. In doing so, it also supports the idea\nthat amalgamating the files recovered from more than one device can result in\nthe recovery of a more complete dataset.

In\nthis paper, we study the extent to which we can reliably match profiles in\npractice, across real-world social networks, by exploiting public attributes,\ni.e., information users publicly provide about themselves. Today's social\nnetworks have hundreds of millions of users, which brings completely new\nchallenges as a reliable matching scheme must identify the correct matching\nprofile out of the millions of possible profiles. We first define a set of\nproperties for profile attributes--Availability, Consistency,\nnon-Impersonability, and Discriminability (ACID)--that are both necessary and\nsufficient to determine the reliability of a matching scheme. Using these\nproperties, we propose a method to evaluate the accuracy of matching schemes in\nreal practical cases. Our results show that the accuracy in practice is\nsignificantly lower than the one reported in prior literature. When considering\nentire social networks, there is a non-negligible number of profiles that\nbelong to different users but have similar attributes, which leads to many\nfalse matches.

At\nthe same time it is a very promising approach, since concurrent programs are\ndifficult to get right, or to analyze with traditional verification techniques.\nThis paper gives an introduction to distributed synthesis in the setting of\nMazurkiewicz traces, and its applications to decentralized runtime monitoring.\n1 Context Modern computing systems are increasingly distributed and\nheterogeneous. Software needs to be able to exploit these advances, providing\nmeans for applications to be more performant. Traditional concurrent\nprogramming paradigms, as in Java, are based on threads, shared-memory, and\nlocking mechanisms that guard access to common data. More recent paradigms like\nthe reactive programming model of Erlang [4] and Scala [35,36] replace shared\nmemory by asynchronous message passing, where sending a message is\nnon-blocking. In all these concurrent frameworks, writing reliable software is\na serious challenge. Programmers tend to think about code mostly in a\nsequential way, and it is hard to grasp all possible schedulings of events in a\nconcurrent execution. For similar reasons, verification and analysis of\nconcurrent programs is a difficult task. Testing, which is still the main\nmethod for error detection in software, has low coverage for concurrent\nprograms. The reason is that bugs in such programs are difficult to reproduce:\nthey may happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of\ntaking such corner-case schedules is very low. Automated verification, such as\nmodel-checking and other traditional exploration techniques, can handle very\nlimited instances of concurrent programs, mostly because of the very large\nnumber of possible states and of possible interleavings of executions. Formal\nanalysis of programs requires as a prerequisite a clean mathematical model for\nprograms. Verification of sequential programs starts usually with an\nabstraction step -- reducing the value domains of variables to finite domains,\nviewing conditional branching as non-determinism, etc. Another major\nsimplification consists in disallowing recursion.

In this situation,\nthe flow induced by the Lorentz force is found to be localized in a shear layer\nbelow the ICB, which thickness depends on the strength of the stratification,\nbut not on the magnetic field strength.

CAST Micromegas\ndetectors exploit different strategies developed for the reduction of the\nbackground level. Moreover, different test benches have been developed in order\nto understand the origin of the background. The state of art in low background\ntechniques is shown in the upgrades of the Micromegas detectors at CAST, which\nhas led to a reduction of the background in a factor $\\sim$6. It translates in\nan improvement of the sensitivity of CAST in a factor $\\sim$2.5. Beyond CAST a\nnew generation axion helioscope has been proposed: IAXO-the International Axion\nObservatory. IAXO will enhance the helioscope technique by exploiting all the\nsingularities of CAST implemented into a large superconducting toroidal magnet,\ndedicated X-ray optics and ultra-low background detectors. A description of the\nIAXO proposal and the study of the sensitivity of IAXO are presented in this\nthesis. IAXO will surpass CAST in more than one order of magnitude, entering\ninto an unexplored parameter space area.\n","Comment: PhD. Thesis"]}]

The Lagrangian includes a special kind of new vertices\nwhich at first sight, look as breaking power counting renormalizability.\nHowever, these terms also modify the quark propagators, to become more\ndecreasing that the Dirac propagator at large momenta, indicating that the\ntheory is renormalizable. Therefore, it follows the surprising conclusion that\nthe added NJL four fermions terms does not break renormalizability. The\napproach, can also be interpreted as a slightly generalized renormalization\nprocedure for massless QCD, which seems able to incorporate the mass generating\nproperties for the quarks of the NJL model, in a renormalizable way. The\nstructure of the free propagator, given by the substraction between a massive\nand a massless Dirac one in the Lee-Wick form, also suggests that the theory\nretains unitarity, if the radiative corrections make the massless quarks become\nnon propagating. The appearance of finite masses in the theory is justified by\nthe fact that the new action terms break chiral invariance. The scheme looks as\nbeing able to implement the Fritzsch Democratic Symmetry breaking approach to\nquark mass hierarchy. It seems also possible to further link the theory with\nthe SM after employing the Zimmermann's coupling constant reduction scheme in a\nsimilar way as the Top quark condensation model had been approximately\nreformulated as a Higgs field one.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 5 figures"]}]
