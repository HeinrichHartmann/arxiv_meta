Bender, Jun-Hua Chen, and Kimball A. Milton (\nJ.Phys.A39:1657-1668, 2006). In this article, Bender \\textit{et.al} have\ncalculated the vacuum energy of the $i\\phi^{3}$ scalar field theory and its\nHermitian equivalent theory up to $g^{4}$ order of calculations. While all the\nFeynman diagrams of the $i\\phi^{3}$ theory are finite in $0+1$ space-time\ndimensions, some of the corresponding Feynman diagrams in the equivalent\nHermitian theory are divergent. In this work, we show that the divergences in\nthe Hermitian theory originate from superrenormalizable, renormalizable and\nnon-renormalizable terms in the interaction Hamiltonian even though the\ncalculations are carried out in the $0+1$ space-time dimensions. Relying on\nthis interesting result, we raise the question, is the superficial degree of\ndivergence of a theory is representation dependent? To answer this question, we\nintroduce and study a class of non-Hermitian quantum field theories\ncharacterized by a field derivative interaction Hamiltonian. We showed that the\nclass is physically acceptable by finding the corresponding class of metric\noperators in a closed form. We realized that the obtained equivalent Hermitian\nand the introduced non-Hermitian representations have coupling constants of\ndifferent mass dimensions which may be considered as a clue for the possibility\nof considering non-Renormalizability of a field theory as a non-genuine\nproblem. Besides, the metric operator is supposed to disappear from path\nintegral calculations which means that physical amplitudes can be fully\nobtained in the simpler non-Hermitian representation.\n","Comment: 14 pages one figure.

Yet, the clustering strength\nof cold dark matter halos depends upon halo properties in addition to mass,\nsuch as formation time, an effect referred to as assembly bias. If galaxy\ncharacteristics are correlated with any of these auxiliary halo properties, the\nbasic assumption of HOD/CLF methods is violated. We estimate the potential for\nassembly bias to induce systematic errors in inferred halo occupation\nstatistics. We use halo abundance matching and age matching to construct\nfiducial mock galaxy catalogs that exhibit assembly bias as well as additional\nmock catalogs with identical HODs, but with assembly bias removed. We fit a\nparameterized HOD to the projected two-point clustering of mock galaxies in\neach catalog to assess the systematic errors induced by reasonable levels of\nassembly bias. In the absence of assembly bias, the inferred HODs generally\ndescribe the true underlying HODs well, validating the basic methodology.\nHowever, in all of the cases with assembly bias, the inferred HODs have\nsystematic errors that are statistically significant. In most cases, these\nsystematic errors cannot be identified using void statistics as auxiliary\nobservables. We conclude that the galaxy-halo relationship inferred from galaxy\nclustering should be subject to a non-negligible systematic error induced by\nassembly bias.

In particular, we predict the\noccurrence of a very large thermophase which can reach $\\pi/2$ across the\ncontact for suitable temperatures and structure parameters, i.e., the\nquasiparticle thermal current can reach the critical current. Such a\nthermophase can be several orders of magnitude larger than that predicted to\noccur in conventional Josephson tunnel junctions. In order to assess\nexperimentally the predicted very large thermophase we propose a realistic\nsetup realizable with state-of-the-art nano fabrication techniques and\nwell-established materials which is based on a superconducting quantum\ninterference device. This effect could be of strong relevance in several\nlow-temperature applications, for example, for revealing tiny temperature\ndifferences generated by coupling the electromagnetic radiation to one of the\nsuperconductors forming the junction.\n","Comment: 4.5 pages, 4 color figures"]}]

The study focusses on the\neffects of different processes on the C/O ratio like the disc evolution, the\ndrift of gas, and the migration of the planet. We used our previous models for\ncomputation of the chemical composition together with the planet formation\nmodel of Alibert et al. (2013), to which we added the composition and drift of\nthe gas phase of the disc composed of major volatile species, H2 and He. The\nstudy focusses on the region where ice lines are present and influence the C/O\nratio of the planets. Modelling shows that the condensation of volatile species\nallows for C/O enrichment in specific parts of the protoplanetary disc, of up\nto 4 times the solar value. This leads to the formation of planets that can be\nenriched in C/O in their envelope up to 3 times the solar value. The migration\nof planets, the evolution of the gas phase, and the irradiation of the disc\nenables the evolution of the initial C/O ratio with a decrease in the outer\npart of the disc and an increase in the inner part. The total C/O ratio of the\nplanets is governed by the contribution of ices accreted, suggesting that high\nC/O ratios measured in planetary atmospheres are indicative of a lack of\nexchange of material between the core of a planet and its envelope or an\nobservational bias, and suggesting that the observed C/O ratio is not\nrepresentative of the total C/O ratio of the planet.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 15 figures.

We extended our SCEPtER grid\n(Valle et al. 2014) to include stars with mass in the range [0.8; 1.6] Msun and\nevolutionary stages from the ZAMS to the central hydrogen depletion. The\ncurrent typical uncertainty in the observations accounts for 1 sigma\nstatistical relative error in age determination which in mean ranges from about\n-35% to +42%, depending on the mass. However, due to the strong dependence on\nthe evolutionary phase, the age relative error can be higher than 120% for\nstars near the ZAMS, while it is typically of the order of 20% or lower in the\nadvanced main-sequence phase. The systematic bias on age determination due to a\nvariation of $\\pm$ 1 in the helium-to-metal enrichment ratio Delta Y/Delta Z is\nabout one-forth of the statistical error in the first 30% of the evolution\nwhile it is negligible for more evolved stages.

For all the examined models the impact of a\nvariation of $\\pm$ 5 in the radiative opacity was found to be negligible. The\nmost important source of bias are the uncertainty in the mixing-length value\nalpha_ml and the neglect of microscopic diffusion. Each of these effects\naccounts for a bias which is nearly equal to the random error uncertainty.\nComparison of the results of our technique with other grid techniques on a set\nof common stars showed a general agreement.

Silver\nnanowires with diameters of 6.5 nm and length exceeding microns are synthesized\nin aqueous solution by reduction of silver ions within the nanotubular\nJ-aggregates of an amphiphilic cyanine dye. The time scale of the growth of the\nnanowires is of the order of hours and days which provides the unique\npossibility to investigate the nucleation, growth, and dissolution of the\nnanowires by direct imaging using transmission electron microscopy. It is found\nthat the initial nucleation and formation of seeds of silver nanostructures\noccurs randomly at the outer surface of the aggregates or within the hollow\ntube. The growth of the seeds within the inner void of the tubular structures\nto nanowires indicates transport of silver atoms, ions, or clusters through the\nbilayer wall of the molecular aggregates. This permeability of the aggregates\nfor silver can be utilized to dissolve the preformed silver wires by oxidative\netching using Cl- ions from dissolved NaCl.

Galaxy clusters can be used as cosmological probes, but to this end,\nthey need to be thoroughly understood. Combining all cluster observables in a\nconsistent way will help us to understand their global properties and their\ninternal structure. Aims. We provide proof of the concept that the projected\ngravitational potential of galaxy clusters can directly be reconstructed from\nX-ray observations. We also show that this joint analysis can be used to\nlocally test the validity of the equilibrium assumptions in galaxy clusters.\nMethods. We used a newly developed reconstruction method, based on\nRichardson-Lucy deprojection, that allows reconstructing projected\ngravitational potentials of galaxy clusters directly from X-ray observations.\nWe applied this algorithm to the well-studied cluster Abell 1689 and compared\nthe gravitational potential reconstructed from X-ray observables to the\npotential obtained from gravitational lensing measurements. [...] Results.\nAssuming spherical symmetry and hydrostatic equilibrium, the potentials\nrecovered from gravitational lensing and from X-ray emission agree very well\nbeyond 500 kpc. Owing to the fact that the Richardson-Lucy deprojection\nalgorithm allows deprojecting each line of sight independently, this result may\nindicate that non-gravitational effects and/or asphericity are strong in the\ncentral regions of the clusters. Conclusions. We demonstrate the robustness of\nthe potential reconstruction method based on the Richardson-Lucy deprojection\nalgorithm and show that gravitational lensing and X-ray emission lead to\nconsistent gravitational potentials. Our results illustrate the power of\ncombining galaxy-cluster observables in a single, non-parametric, joint\nreconstruction of consistent cluster potentials that can be used to locally\nconstrain the physical state of the gas.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures.

This evolution could result in a Supernova Ia (SN Ia) explosion and is\ndesignated the Single Degenerate Progenitor (SD) scenario. One problem with the\nsingle degenerate scenario is that it is generally assumed that the accreting\nmaterial mixes with WD core material at some time during the accretion phase of\nevolution and, since the typical WD has a carbon-oxygen (CO) core, the mixing\nresults in large amounts of carbon and oxygen being brought up into the\naccreted layers.

In summary, our approach produces more\nsuccinct and more explainable strategies, as opposed to e.g. binary decision\ndiagrams. Finally, our experimental results show that we can extract several\nrules describing the strategy even for very large systems that do not fit in\nmemory, and based on the rules explain the erroneous behaviour.\n"]}]

We assume that the gas giants and terrestrial\nplanets are already formed when we check the collisions of the small bodies\ncontaining water (in the order of a few percent) with the terrestrial planets.\nWe thus are able to give an estimate of the respective contribution to the\nactual water content (of some Earth-oceans) in the mantle, in the crust and on\nthe surface of Earth. In the second part we discuss in more detail how the\nformation of larger bodies after a collision may happen as the outcome depends\non parameters like collision velocity, impact angle, and the materials\ninvolved. We present results obtained by SPH (Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics)\nsimulations. We briefly describe this method and show different scenarios with\nrespect to the formed bodies, possible fragmentation and the water content\nbefore and after the collision. In an appendix we discuss detection methods for\nextrasolar planets (close to 2000 such objects have been discovered so far).\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Nonlinear Phenomena in Complex\n  Systems, ISSN 1561-4085 (Print), ISSN 1817-2458 (Online)"]}]

Reasoning about reactive systems using\nrefinement involves defining an abstract, high-level specification system and a\nconcrete, low-level implementation system. One then shows that every behavior\nallowed by the implementation is also allowed by the specification. Due to the\ndifference in abstraction levels, it is often the case that the implementation\nrequires many steps to match one step of the specification, hence, it is quite\nuseful for refinement to directly account for stuttering. Some optimized\nimplementations, however, can actually take multiple specification steps at\nonce. For example, a memory controller can buffer the commands to the memory\nand at a later time simultaneously update multiple memory locations, thereby\nskipping several observable states of the abstract specification, which only\nupdates one memory location at a time.
