The volume of a metric ball in unitary group is also computed\nas well.\n  There are no new results in this article, but only detailed and elementary\nproofs of existing results.

Notable examples are the MIS and\n$(\\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithms by Barenboim and Elkin [6], by Kuhn [22], and\nby Panconesi and Srinivasan [34], as well as the $O(\\Delta 2)$-coloring\nalgorithm by Linial [28]. Unfortunately, most known local algorithms\n(including, in particular, the aforementioned algorithms) are non-uniform, that\nis, local algorithms generally use good estimations of one or more global\nparameters of the network, e.g., the maximum degree $\\Delta$ or the number of\nnodes n. This paper provides a method for transforming a non-uniform local\nalgorithm into a uniform one. Furthermore , the resulting algorithm enjoys the\nsame asymp-totic running time as the original non-uniform algorithm. Our method\napplies to a wide family of both deterministic and randomized algorithms.\nSpecifically, it applies to almost all state of the art non-uniform algorithms\nfor MIS and Maximal Matching, as well as to many results concerning the\ncoloring problem. (In particular, it applies to all aforementioned algorithms.)\nTo obtain our transformations we introduce a new distributed tool called\npruning algorithms, which we believe may be of independent interest.\n"]}]
