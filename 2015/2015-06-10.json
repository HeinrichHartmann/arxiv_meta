Evolutionary game theory has shown that under certain conditions,\ncooperation nonetheless evolves stably, for example if players have the\nopportunity to punish cheaters that benefit from a public good yet refuse to\npay into the common pool. However, punishment has remained enigmatic because it\nis costly, and difficult to maintain. On the other hand, cooperation emerges\nnaturally in the Public Goods game if the synergy of the public good (the\nfactor multiplying the public good investment) is sufficiently high. In terms\nof this synergy parameter, the transition from defection to cooperation can be\nviewed as a phase transition with the synergy as the critical parameter. We\nshow here that punishment reduces the critical value at which cooperation\noccurs, but also creates the possibility of meta-stable phase transitions,\nwhere populations can \"tunnel\" into the cooperating phase below the critical\nvalue. At the same time, cooperating populations are unstable even above the\ncritical value, because a group of defectors that are large enough can\n\"nucleate\" such a transition. We study the mean-field theoretical predictions\nvia agent-based simulations of finite populations using an evolutionary\napproach where the decisions to cooperate or to punish are encoded genetically\nin terms of evolvable probabilities. We recover the theoretical predictions and\ndemonstrate that the population shows hysteresis, as expected in systems that\nexhibit super-heating and super-cooling. We conclude that punishment can\nstabilize populations of cooperators below the critical point, but it is a\ntwo-edged sword: it can also stabilize defectors above the critical point.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures.

However, usually it is not until the final stages of a design\nproject that it is possible to model fringe fields for quadrupoles or higher\norder multipoles.

This is what is done in\nthe Weiss-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model. In this article, I will show that using\nthe WZW model on $SU_2$, some of the difficulties encountered in the\ndetermination of the pre and post big-bang solutions are eliminated. Combining\nthe general results obtained with the $\\Lambda $CDM parameters lead to\nrealistic solutions for the evolution of the universe, giving an explanation to\nthe actually observed acceleration of the expansion in terms ot the dilation\nfield $\\phi $(t).\n","Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures"]}]

Instead, we fit the abundance trends with age in order to\nrecover the star formation history of the Galaxy. Our method enables one to\nrecover with unprecedented accuracy the star formation history of the Milky Way\nin the first Gyrs, in both the inner (R<7-8kpc) and outer (R>9-10kpc) discs as\nsampled in the solar vicinity. We show that, in the inner disc, half of the\nstellar mass formed during the thick disc phase, in the first 4-5 Gyr.

The thick disc phase has produced as many metals in 4 Gyr as\nthe thin disc in the remaining 8 Gyr. Our results suggest that a closed box\nmodel is able to fit all the available constraints in the inner disc. A closed\nbox system is qualitatively equivalent to a regime where the accretion rate, at\nhigh redshift, maintains a high gas fraction in the inner disc. In such\nconditions, the SFR is mainly governed by the high turbulence of the ISM. By\nz~1 it is possible that most of the accretion takes place in the outer disc,\nwhile the star formation activity in the inner disc is mostly sustained by the\ngas not consumed during the thick disc phase, and the continuous ejecta from\nearlier generations of stars.

We use a coarse-grained model of DNA to\ncharacterize such bulged duplexes.

Small loops favor states where stacking at the center of the\nduplex is preserved, with loop bases either flipped out or incorporated into\nthe duplex. Duplexes with longer loops show more of a tendency to unstack at\nthe bulge and adopt an open structure.

Our results for the fundamental frequencies are compared to\nthose obtained from an independent numerical Cauchy evolution, finding good\nagreement between the two approaches. When the radius of the sonic horizon is\nlarge compared to the event horizon radius, we find that the quasi-normal\nfrequencies scale approximately like the surface gravity associated with the\nsonic horizon.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 12 figures.

The motion of the\nwalker is characterized by linear displacements at a fixed speed and\nexponentially distributed duration, interrupted by random changes in the\ndirection of motion and resumption of motion in the new direction with the same\nspeed. We call these walkers \"mortal creepers\". A mortal creeper may die at any\ntime during its motion according to an exponential decay law characterized by a\nfinite mean death rate $\\omega_m$.

In particular, we\nconsider the efficiency of the target search process, characterized by the\nprobability that the creeper will eventually detect the target. Analytic\nresults confirmed by numerical results show that there is an\n$\\omega_m$-dependent optimal frequency $\\omega=\\omega_{opt}$ that maximizes the\nprobability of eventual target detection.

We used\nthe IRAM 30-m telescope to perform a sensitive search for molecular lines in AB\nAur as part of the IRAM Large program ASAI (A Chemical Survey of Sun-like\nStar-forming Regions). These data were complemented with interferometric\nobservations of the HCO+ 1-0 and C17O 1-0 lines using the IRAM Plateau de Bure\nInterferometer (PdBI). Single-dish and interferometric data were used to\nconstrain chemical models. Results. Throughout the survey, several lines of CO\nand its isotopologues, HCO+, H2CO, HCN, CN and CS, were detected.

The magnetic phase diagram of MnSi in applied\nmagnetic field appears to depend on the experimental setups, which is related\nto a difference in demagnetization factors arising due to the disc shape of the\nsample. The magnetic phase transition in MnSi in zero magnetic field is\nsignified by a quasi discontinuity in the c11 elastic constant, which varies\nsignificantly with magnetic field. It is notable that the region where the c11\ndiscontinuity almost vanishes closely corresponds to the extent of skyrmion\nphase along the magnetic to paramagnetic transition. This implies that the c11\nelastic constant is almost continuous through the transition from the skyrmion\nto paramagnetic phases. A recovery of the discontinuity of c11 and enhanced\nsound absorption occur at the crossing of the phase transition line and the\nline of minima in c11. The powerful fluctuations at the minima of c11 make the\nmentioned crossing point similar to a critical end point, where a second order\nphase transition meets a first order one. The skyrmion domain in the case of a\nperpendicular setup with a smaller demagnetization factor has a reduced\ntemperature range, which suggests that the magnetic field inhomogeneity plays\nan important role in the skyrmion occurrence and, hence, opens a way of\nskyrmion manipulation.

This suggests that Ly$\\alpha$ preferentially\nescapes from blue galaxies with low dust attenuation. However, a small\npopulation of red and massive LAEs is also present in agreement with previous\nworks. This indicates that dust and Ly$\\alpha$ are not mutually exclusive.\nUsing different and completely independent measures of the total SFR we show\nthat the H$\\alpha$ emission is an excellent tracer of star formation at $z \\sim\n2$ with deviations typically lower than 0.3 dex for individual galaxies.

For oblate modes under a\nhomologous flow, a monatomic gas is governed by the Schwarzschild criterion for\nbuoyant stability. Under buoyantly unstable conditions, fluctuations experience\npower-law growth in time, with a growth rate that depends upon mean flow\ngradients and is independent of mode number. If the flow accelerates throughout\nthe implosion, oblate modes amplify by a factor (2C)^(|N0| ti)$, where C is the\nconvergence ratio of the implosion, N0 is the initial buoyancy frequency and ti\nis the implosion time scale. If, instead, the implosion consists of a coasting\nphase followed by stagnation, oblate modes amplify by a factor exp(pi |N0| ts),\nwhere N0 is the buoyancy frequency at stagnation and ts is the stagnation time\nscale. Even under stable conditions, vorticity fluctuations grow due to the\nconservation of angular momentum as the gas is compressed. For non-monatomic\ngases, this results in weak oscillatory growth under conditions that would\notherwise be buoyantly stable; this over-stability is consistent with the\nconservation of wave action in the fluid frame. By evolving the complete set of\nlinear equations, it is demonstrated that oblate modes are the fastest-growing\nmodes and that high mode numbers are required to reach this limit (Legendre\nmode l > 100 for spherical flows). Finally, comparisons are made with a\nLagrangian hydrodynamics code, and it is found that a numerical resolution of\n~30 zones per wavelength is required to capture these solutions accurately.\nThis translates to an angular resolution of ~(12/l) degrees, or < 0.1 degree to\nresolve the fastest-growing modes.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the Journal of Fluid\n  Mechanics Rapids"]}]

The\nclass of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces carries\nclose ties to the property of complete integrability, as manifested by the\nexistence of infinite hierarchies of conservation laws and associated linear\nproblems. As such, it contains many important known examples of integrable\nequations, like the sine-Gordon, Liouville and KdV equations. It also gives\nrise to many new families of integrable equations. The question we address in\nthis paper concerns the local isometric immersion of pseudo-spherical surfaces\nin ${\\bf E}^{3}$ from the perspective of the differential equations that give\nrise to the metrics. Indeed, a classical theorem in the differential geometry\nof surfaces states that any pseudo-spherical surface can be locally\nisometrically immersed in ${\\bf E}^{3}$. In the case of the sine-Gordon\nequation, one can derive an expression for the second fundamental form of the\nimmersion that depends only on a jet of finite order of the solution of the\npde. A natural question is to know if this remarkable property extends to\nequations other than the sine-Gordon equation within the class of differential\nequations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces. In an earlier paper [11], we\nhave shown that this property fails to hold for all other second order\nequations, except for those belonging to a very special class of evolution\nequations.

The error events of the equivalent convolutional code are exactly the\nundetectable errors for the original concatenation of CRC and convolutional\ncodes. This simplifies the computation because error patterns do not need to be\nindividually checked for detectability. As an example, we optimize CRC codes\nfor a commonly used 64-state convolutional code for information length k=1024\ndemonstrating significant reduction in undetected error probability compared to\nthe existing CRC codes with the same degrees.
