Evolutionary game theory has shown that under certain conditions,\ncooperation nonetheless evolves stably, for example if players have the\nopportunity to punish cheaters that benefit from a public good yet refuse to\npay into the common pool. However, punishment has remained enigmatic because it\nis costly, and difficult to maintain. On the other hand, cooperation emerges\nnaturally in the Public Goods game if the synergy of the public good (the\nfactor multiplying the public good investment) is sufficiently high. In terms\nof this synergy parameter, the transition from defection to cooperation can be\nviewed as a phase transition with the synergy as the critical parameter. We\nshow here that punishment reduces the critical value at which cooperation\noccurs, but also creates the possibility of meta-stable phase transitions,\nwhere populations can \"tunnel\" into the cooperating phase below the critical\nvalue. At the same time, cooperating populations are unstable even above the\ncritical value, because a group of defectors that are large enough can\n\"nucleate\" such a transition. We study the mean-field theoretical predictions\nvia agent-based simulations of finite populations using an evolutionary\napproach where the decisions to cooperate or to punish are encoded genetically\nin terms of evolvable probabilities. We recover the theoretical predictions and\ndemonstrate that the population shows hysteresis, as expected in systems that\nexhibit super-heating and super-cooling. We conclude that punishment can\nstabilize populations of cooperators below the critical point, but it is a\ntwo-edged sword: it can also stabilize defectors above the critical point.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures.

An accurate model of an accelerator must include realistic models of\nthe magnet fringe fields. Fringe fields for dipoles are well understood and can\nbe modelled at an early stage of accelerator design in such codes as MAD8, MADX\nor ELEGANT. However, usually it is not until the final stages of a design\nproject that it is possible to model fringe fields for quadrupoles or higher\norder multipoles. Even then, existing techniques rely on the use of a numerical\nfield map, which will usually not be available until the magnet design is well\ndeveloped.

Instead, we fit the abundance trends with age in order to\nrecover the star formation history of the Galaxy. Our method enables one to\nrecover with unprecedented accuracy the star formation history of the Milky Way\nin the first Gyrs, in both the inner (R<7-8kpc) and outer (R>9-10kpc) discs as\nsampled in the solar vicinity. We show that, in the inner disc, half of the\nstellar mass formed during the thick disc phase, in the first 4-5 Gyr.

The thick disc phase has produced as many metals in 4 Gyr as\nthe thin disc in the remaining 8 Gyr. Our results suggest that a closed box\nmodel is able to fit all the available constraints in the inner disc. A closed\nbox system is qualitatively equivalent to a regime where the accretion rate, at\nhigh redshift, maintains a high gas fraction in the inner disc. In such\nconditions, the SFR is mainly governed by the high turbulence of the ISM.

We use a coarse-grained model of DNA to\ncharacterize such bulged duplexes. We find that this motif can adopt structures\nbelonging to two main classes: one where the stacking of the helices at the\ncenter of the system is preserved, the geometry is roughly straight and the\nbulge is on one side of the duplex, and the other where the stacking at the\ncenter is broken, thus allowing this junction to act as a hinge and increasing\nflexibility. Small loops favor states where stacking at the center of the\nduplex is preserved, with loop bases either flipped out or incorporated into\nthe duplex. Duplexes with longer loops show more of a tendency to unstack at\nthe bulge and adopt an open structure. The unstacking probability, however, is\nhighest for loops of intermediate lengths, when the rigidity of single-stranded\nDNA is significant and the loop resists compression.

We find that the ortho/para ratios\nof ammonia and water are similar in both gas-phase and gas-grain models, at\nlate times in particular, implying that the ratios are determined by gas-phase\nprocesses.

We\npresent an algorithm to generate such timelines for a given time period and\nscreen size, based on submodular optimization and web-co-occurrence statistics\nwith provable performance guarantees. A series of user studies using Mechanical\nTurk shows that all three quality criteria are crucial to produce quality\ntimelines and that our algorithm significantly outperforms various baseline and\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","Comment: To appear at ACM SIGKDD KDD'15. 12pp, 7 fig.

Coulomb drag arises from density\nfluctuations with spatial scales of order $d$. At low temperatures, their\ncharacteristic frequencies exceed the intralayer equilibration rate of the\nelectron liquid, and Coulomb drag may be treated in the collisionless\napproximation. As temperature is raised, the electron mean free path becomes\nshort due to electron-electron scattering. This leads to local equilibration of\nelectron liquid, and consequently drag is determined by hydrodynamic density\nmodes. Our theory applies to both the collisionless and the hydrodynamic\nregimes, and it enables us to describe the crossover between them. We find that\ndrag resistivity exhibits a nonmonotonic temperature dependence with multiple\ncrossovers at distinct energy scales. At the lowest temperatures, Coulomb drag\nis dominated by the particle-hole continuum, whereas at higher temperatures of\nthe collision-dominated regime it is governed by the plasmon modes. We observe\nthat fast intralayer equilibration mediated by electron-electron collisions\nultimately renders a stronger drag effect.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure"]}]

We defined a procedure to search in redshift space for\ncompact groups that can be considered embedded in other overdense systems and\napplied this criterion to several possible combinations of different compact\nand galaxy group subsamples. We also performed similar analyses for simulated\ncompact and galaxy groups identified in a 2M++ mock galaxy catalogue\nconstructed from the Millennium Run Simulation I plus a semi-analytical model\nof galaxy formation. We observed that only $\\sim27\\%$ of the compact groups can\nbe considered to be embedded in larger overdense systems, that is, most of the\ncompact groups are more likely to be isolated systems. The embedded compact\ngroups show statistically smaller sizes and brighter surface brightnesses than\nnon-embedded systems. No evidence was found that embedded compact groups are\nmore likely to inhabit galaxy groups with a given virial mass or with a\nparticular dynamical state. We found very similar results when the analysis was\nperformed using mock compact and galaxy groups. Based on the semi-analytical\nstudies, we predict that $70\\%$ of the embedded compact groups probably are 3D\nphysically dense systems. Finally, real space information allowed us to reveal\nthe bimodal behaviour of the distribution of 3D minimum distances between\ncompact and galaxy groups. The location of compact groups should be carefully\ntaken into account when comparing properties of galaxies in environments that\nare a priori different.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables.

The magnetic phase diagram of MnSi in applied\nmagnetic field appears to depend on the experimental setups, which is related\nto a difference in demagnetization factors arising due to the disc shape of the\nsample. The magnetic phase transition in MnSi in zero magnetic field is\nsignified by a quasi discontinuity in the c11 elastic constant, which varies\nsignificantly with magnetic field. It is notable that the region where the c11\ndiscontinuity almost vanishes closely corresponds to the extent of skyrmion\nphase along the magnetic to paramagnetic transition. This implies that the c11\nelastic constant is almost continuous through the transition from the skyrmion\nto paramagnetic phases. A recovery of the discontinuity of c11 and enhanced\nsound absorption occur at the crossing of the phase transition line and the\nline of minima in c11. The powerful fluctuations at the minima of c11 make the\nmentioned crossing point similar to a critical end point, where a second order\nphase transition meets a first order one.

For oblate modes under a\nhomologous flow, a monatomic gas is governed by the Schwarzschild criterion for\nbuoyant stability. Under buoyantly unstable conditions, fluctuations experience\npower-law growth in time, with a growth rate that depends upon mean flow\ngradients and is independent of mode number. If the flow accelerates throughout\nthe implosion, oblate modes amplify by a factor (2C)^(|N0| ti)$, where C is the\nconvergence ratio of the implosion, N0 is the initial buoyancy frequency and ti\nis the implosion time scale. If, instead, the implosion consists of a coasting\nphase followed by stagnation, oblate modes amplify by a factor exp(pi |N0| ts),\nwhere N0 is the buoyancy frequency at stagnation and ts is the stagnation time\nscale. Even under stable conditions, vorticity fluctuations grow due to the\nconservation of angular momentum as the gas is compressed. For non-monatomic\ngases, this results in weak oscillatory growth under conditions that would\notherwise be buoyantly stable; this over-stability is consistent with the\nconservation of wave action in the fluid frame. By evolving the complete set of\nlinear equations, it is demonstrated that oblate modes are the fastest-growing\nmodes and that high mode numbers are required to reach this limit (Legendre\nmode l > 100 for spherical flows). Finally, comparisons are made with a\nLagrangian hydrodynamics code, and it is found that a numerical resolution of\n~30 zones per wavelength is required to capture these solutions accurately.\nThis translates to an angular resolution of ~(12/l) degrees, or < 0.1 degree to\nresolve the fastest-growing modes.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in the Journal of Fluid\n  Mechanics Rapids"]}]

The\nclass of differential equations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces carries\nclose ties to the property of complete integrability, as manifested by the\nexistence of infinite hierarchies of conservation laws and associated linear\nproblems. As such, it contains many important known examples of integrable\nequations, like the sine-Gordon, Liouville and KdV equations. It also gives\nrise to many new families of integrable equations. The question we address in\nthis paper concerns the local isometric immersion of pseudo-spherical surfaces\nin ${\\bf E}^{3}$ from the perspective of the differential equations that give\nrise to the metrics. Indeed, a classical theorem in the differential geometry\nof surfaces states that any pseudo-spherical surface can be locally\nisometrically immersed in ${\\bf E}^{3}$. In the case of the sine-Gordon\nequation, one can derive an expression for the second fundamental form of the\nimmersion that depends only on a jet of finite order of the solution of the\npde. A natural question is to know if this remarkable property extends to\nequations other than the sine-Gordon equation within the class of differential\nequations describing pseudo-spherical surfaces.

However, such sensors are commonly\naffected by uncertainty. In the present paper, we focus on spatially uncertain\nalarm signals.

Finally, we show\nthat without false positives and missed detections, the best patrolling\nstrategy reduces to stay in a place, wait for a signal, and respond to it at\nbest. This strategy is optimal even with non-negligible missed detection rates,\nwhich, unfortunately, affect every commercial alarm system. We evaluate our\nmethods in simulation, assessing both quantitative and qualitative aspects.\n"]}]
