We focus on surfaces of positive genus $g$ with a single\nboundary curve and $n$ marked points on this curve; we consider triangulations\nup to homeomorphism with the marked points as their vertices. Our main results\nare upper and lower bounds on the maximal distance between triangulations\ndepending on $n$ and can be thought of as bounds on the diameter of flip-graphs\nup to the quotient of underlying homeomorphism groups. The main results assert\nthat the diameter of these quotient graphs grows at least like $5n/2$ for all\n$g\\geq 1$. Our upper bounds grow at most like $[4 -1/(4g)]n$ for $g\\geq 2$, and\nat most like $23n/8 $ for the torus.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 13 figures.
