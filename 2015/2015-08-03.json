In this paper we develop and study an\narchetypal model to explore the nonlinear dynamic interactions between\ngalloping at an incipient sub-critical Hopf bifurcation of a structure with\nshell-like buckling behaviour that is gravity-loaded to approach a sub-critical\npitch-fork bifurcation. For the fluid forces, we draw on the aerodynamic\ncoefficients determined experimentally by Novak for the flow around a bluff\nbody of rectangular cross-section. Meanwhile, for the structural component, we\nconsider a variant of the propped-cantilever model that is widely used to\nillustrate the sub-critical pitchfork: within this model a symmetry-breaking\nimperfection makes the behaviour generic. The compound bifurcation\ncorresponding to simultaneous galloping and buckling is the so-called\nTakens-Bodganov Cusp.

We have explored the\nparameter space of this scenario, computed the gamma ray spectrum for each\nphenomenologically viable solution and then performed a chi^2 fit to the\nexcess.

This paper\ncritically re-examines this formation scenario by comparing the number ratio of\nRR Lyrae to M giant stars associated with the TriAnd clouds with other\nstructures in the Galaxy. The current data suggest a stellar population for\nthese over-densities ($f_{\\rm RR:MG} < 0.38$ at 95% confidence) quite unlike\nany of the known satellites of the Milky Way ($f_{\\rm RR:MG} \\approx 0.5$ for\nthe very largest and $f_{\\rm RR:MG} >>1$ for the smaller satellites) and more\nlike the population of stars born in the much deeper potential well inhabited\nby the Galactic disk ($f_{\\rm RR:MG} < 0.01$). N-body simulations of a\nMilky-Way-like galaxy perturbed by the impact of a dwarf galaxy demonstrate\nthat, in the right circumstances, concentric rings propagating outwards from\nthat Galactic disk can plausibly produce similar over-densities. These results\nprovide dramatic support for the recent proposal by Xu et al.

If so, these would be the first\npopulations of disk stars to be found in the Galactic halo and a clear\nsignature of the importance of this second formation mechanism for stellar\nhalos more generally.

Collapse and\nsubsequent behaviour are described by a system of ordinary differential\nequations for time evolution of semi-axes of a uniformly rotating, three-axis,\nuniform-density ellipsoid. First, we apply this approach to investigate dynamic\nstability of non-spherical bodies. We solve the equations that describe, in a\nsimplified way, the Newtonian dynamics of a self-gravitating non-rotating\nspheroidal body. We find that, after loss of stability, a contraction to a\nsingularity occurs only in a pure spherical collapse, and deviations from\nspherical symmetry prevent the contraction to the singularity through a\nstabilizing action of nonlinear non-spherical oscillations. The development of\ninstability leads to the formation of a regularly or chaotically oscillating\nbody, in which dynamical motion prevents the formation of the singularity. We\nfind regions of chaotic and regular pulsations by constructing a Poincare\ndiagram. A real collapse occurs after damping of the oscillations because of\nenergy losses, shock wave formation or viscosity.

The generic feature,\nuncovered both by analytic and numeric studies, is the emergence at the\ncritical point of gapless weakly-interacting modes, which act as qubits for\ninformation-storage at a very low energy cost. These modes can be effectively\ndescribed in terms of either Bogoliubov or Goldstone degrees of freedom. The\nground-state at the critical point is maximally entangled and far from being\nclassical. We confirm this near-critical behavior by a new analytic method. We\ncompute growth of entanglement and show its consistency with black hole type\nbehavior. On the other hand, in the over-critical regime the system develops a\nLyapunov exponent and scrambles quantum information very fast. By, manipulating\nthe system parameters externally, we can put it in and out of various regimes\nand in this way control the sequence of information storage and processing. By\nusing gapless Bogoliubov modes as control qubits we design some simple logic\ngates.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 1 figure, Latex"]}]
