We address these\nchallenges by introducing an equivalence relation on the CFG paths to partition\nthem into equivalence classes. It is then sufficient to perform analysis on\nthese equivalence classes rather than on the individual paths in a CFG. This\ntechnique has two major advantages: (a) although the number of paths in a CFG\ncan be exponentially large, the essential information to be analyzed is\ncaptured by a small number of equivalence classes, and (b) checking path\nfeasibility becomes simpler. The key challenge is how to efficiently compute\nequivalence classes of paths in a CFG without examining each path in the CFG?\nIn this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm to form equivalence classes\nwithout the need for examination of each path in a CFG. The key to this\nalgorithm is construction of an event-flow graph (EFG), a compact derivative of\nthe CFG, in which each path represents an equivalence class of paths in the\ncorresponding CFG. EFGs are defined with respect to the set of events that are\nin turn defined by the analyzed property. The equivalence classes are thus\nguaranteed to preserve all the event traces in the original CFG. We present an\nempirical evaluation of the Linux kernel (v3.12). The EFGs in our evaluation\nare defined with respect to events of the spin safe-synchronization property.\nEvaluation results show that there are many fewer EFG-based equivalence classes\ncompared to the corresponding number of paths in a CFG.

This tool will soon be\navailable for short-lived neutron-rich nuclei. [Purpose] Beyond mean-field\nmethods have been successfully applied to the study of excitation spectra of\nnuclei in the whole nuclear chart. These methods permit to determine energies\nand transition probabilities starting from an effective in-medium\nnucleon-nucleon interaction but without other phenomenological ingredients.\nSuch a method has recently been extended to calculate the charge density of\nnuclei deformed at the mean-field level of approximation [J. M. Yao et al.,\nPhys. Rev. C86, 014310 (2012)]. The aim of this work is to further extend the\nmethod to the determination of transition densities between low-lying excited\nstates. [Method] The starting point of our method is a set of\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov wave functions generated with a constraint on the axial\nquadrupole moment and using a Skyrme energy density functional. Correlations\nbeyond the mean field are introduced by projecting mean-field wave functions on\nangular-momentum and particle number and by mixing the symmetry restored wave\nfunctions.[Results] We give in this paper detailed formulae derived for the\ncalculation of densities and form factors. These formulae are rather easy to\nobtain when both initial and final states are $0^+$ states but are far from\nbeing trivial when one of the states has a finite $J$-value. Illustrative\napplications to $^{24}$Mg and to the even-mass $^{58-68}$Ni have permitted to\nanalyse the main features of our method, in particular the effect of\ndeformation on densities and form factors.

These discrete flows are\nimplicit Euler time stepping according to the Wasserstein metric. A bottleneck\nof these approaches is the high computational load induced by the resolution of\neach step. Indeed, this corresponds to the resolution of a convex optimization\nproblem involving a Wasserstein distance to the previous iterate.

In such environments, sensor nodes typically appear\nas coplanar node clusters. We refer to this type of a deployment as a planar\ndeployment. When there is a planar deployment, the coplanarity causes\ndifficulties to the traditional range-based multilateration algorithms because\na node cannot be unambiguously localized if the distance measurements to that\nnode are from coplanar nodes. Thus, many already localized groups of nodes are\nrendered ineffective in the process just because they are coplanar.

This is a\nwell known process in QED, and it is called the \"Quasi-Real Electron method\",\nwhere the incident particle is an electron and a hard photon is emitted leaving\nan 'almost on shell' electron impinging on the target \\cite{Baier:1973ms}. Such\nprocess is well known as Initial State Emission (ISR) method of scanning over\nincident energy, and can be used, in the hadron case, to produce different kind\nof particles in similar kinematical conditions. In case of emission of a\ncharged light meson, $\\pi$ or $\\rho$-meson, in proton-proton(anti-proton)\ncollisions, the meson can be deviated in a magnetic field and detected. The\ncollinear emission (along the beam direction) of a charged meson may be used to\nproduce high energy (anti)neutron beams. This can be very useful to measure the\ndifference of the cross sections of (anti)proton and (anti)neutron scattering\nfrom the target and may open the way for checking sum rules with antiparticles.\nHard meson emission allows also to enhance the cross section when the energy\nloss from one of the incident particles lowers the total energy up to the mass\nof a resonance. The cross section can be calculated, on the basis of factorized\nformulas, where the probability of emission of the light mesons multiplies the\ncross section of the sub-process. Multiplicity distributions for neutral and\ncharged meson production are also given.\n","Comment: XXII International Baldin Seminar on High Energy Physics Problems,\n  15-20 September 2014 JINR, Dubna, Russia. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1306.5169"]}]

The ultimate goal is to give a construction that\nmatches what is given by the probabilistic method --- an extractor for two\nindependent $n$-bit weak random sources with min-entropy as small as $\\log\nn+O(1)$. Previously, the best known result in the two-source case is an\nextractor by Bourgain \\cite{Bourgain05}, which works for min-entropy $0.49n$;\nand the best known result in the general case is an earlier work of the author\n\\cite{Li13b}, which gives an extractor for a constant number of independent\nsources with min-entropy $\\mathsf{polylog(n)}$. However, the constant in the\nconstruction of \\cite{Li13b} depends on the hidden constant in the best known\nseeded extractor, and can be large; moreover the error in that construction is\nonly $1/\\mathsf{poly(n)}$.\n  In this paper, we make two important improvements over the result in\n\\cite{Li13b}.

Second, we\nimprove the error of the extractor from $1/\\mathsf{poly(n)}$ to\n$2^{-k^{\\Omega(1)}}$, which is almost optimal and crucial for cryptographic\napplications.

The testbed\nrealizes and tests not only the original MI mechanism that utilizes single coil\nbut also recent developed techniques that use the MI waveguide and the\n3-directional (3D) MI coils. The experiments are conducted in an in-lab\nunderground environment with reconfigurable environmental parameters such as\nsoil composition and water content. This paper provides the principles and\nguidelines for developing the MI underground communications testbed, which is\nvery complicated and time-consuming due to the new communication mechanism and\nthe new wireless transmission medium.\n"]}]

We\nconsider corresponding effective Hamiltonians for the three classes of the\ntwo-species insulators-- fermion-fermion, boson-boson, and boson-fermion type--\nand reveal the conditions when the resulting groundstate supports\nsuper-counter-fluidity (SCF) of the two components. Alternative groundstates\nare found to be phase-segregated states. We emphasize a crucial role of\nbreaking the isotopic symmetry between the species for realizing the SCF phase.\n","Comment: Eq.(9) is corrected: factor of 2 is replaced by 1/2.

A mixed state (operator of density matrix) of n two-level\nquantum systems is considered as an element of 4^n-dimensional operator Hilbert\nspace (Liouville space). It allows to use a quantum computer model with\nfour-valued logic. The gates of this model are general superoperators which act\non n-ququat state. Ququat is a quantum state in a four-dimensional (operator)\nHilbert space. Unitary two-valued logic gates and quantum operations for an\nn-qubit open system are considered as four-valued logic gates acting on\nn-ququat.
