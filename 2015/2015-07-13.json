They have been\nwidely used in large-scale optimization problems. However, stochastic gradient\nalgorithms are usually slow to converge and achieve sub-linear convergence\nrates, due to the inherent variance in the gradient computation. To accelerate\nthe convergence, some variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms, e.g.,\nproximal stochastic variance-reduced gradient (Prox-SVRG) algorithm, have\nrecently been proposed to solve strongly convex problems. Under the strongly\nconvex condition, these variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms achieve\na linear convergence rate. However, many machine learning problems are convex\nbut not strongly convex. In this paper, we introduce Prox-SVRG and its\nprojected variant called Variance-Reduced Projected Stochastic Gradient (VRPSG)\nto solve a class of non-strongly convex optimization problems widely used in\nmachine learning. As the main technical contribution of this paper, we show\nthat both VRPSG and Prox-SVRG achieve a linear convergence rate without strong\nconvexity. A key ingredient in our proof is a Semi-Strongly Convex (SSC)\ninequality which is the first to be rigorously proved for a class of\nnon-strongly convex problems in both constrained and regularized settings.\nMoreover, the SSC inequality is independent of algorithms and may be applied to\nanalyze other stochastic gradient algorithms besides VRPSG and Prox-SVRG, which\nmay be of independent interest.

Turbulent and mean\nmeteorological data were continuously measured at multiple levels at four\ntowers deployed along the East lower slope (2-4 deg) of Granite Mountain. The\nmulti-level observations made during a 30-day long MATERHORN-Fall field\ncampaign in September-October 2012 allowed studying of temporal and spatial\nstructure of katabatic flows in detail, and herein we report turbulence and\ntheir variations in katabatic winds. Observed vertical profiles show steep\ngradients near the surface, but in the layer above the slope jet the vertical\nvariability is smaller. It is found that the vertical (normal to the slope)\nmomentum flux and horizontal (along the slope) heat flux in a slope-following\ncoordinate system change their sign below and above the wind maximum of a\nkatabatic flow. The vertical momentum flux is directed downward (upward)\nwhereas the horizontal heat flux is downslope (upslope) below (above) the wind\nmaximum. Our study therefore suggests that the position of the jet-speed\nmaximum can be obtained by linear interpolation between positive and negative\nvalues of the momentum flux (or the horizontal heat flux) to derive the height\nwhere flux becomes zero. It is shown that the standard deviations of all wind\nspeed components (therefore the turbulent kinetic energy) and the dissipation\nrate of turbulent kinetic energy have a local minimum, whereas the standard\ndeviation of air temperature has an absolute maximum at the height of\nwind-speed maximum. We report several cases where the vertical and horizontal\nheat fluxes are compensated.

The solutions show two extreme cases: close-in\ngiant gaseous planets, with fast relaxation (low viscosity) and satellites and\nEarth-like planets, with slow relaxation (high viscosity). The rotation of\nclose-in gaseous planets follows the classical Darwinian pattern: it is tidally\ndriven towards a stationary solution which is synchronized, but, if the orbit\nis elliptical, with a frequency larger than the orbital mean-motion. The\nrotation of rocky bodies, however, may be driven to several attractors whose\nfrequencies are 1/2,1,3/2,2,5/2 ... times the mean-motion. The number of\nattractors increases with the viscosity of the body and with the orbital\neccentricity. The classical example is Mercury, whose rotational period is 2/3\nof the orbital period (3/2 attractor). The planet behaves as a molten body with\na relaxation that allowed it to cross the 2/1 attractor without being trapped,\nbut not to escape being trapped in the 3/2 one. In that case, the relaxation is\nestimated to lie in the interval 4.6 -- 27 x 10^{-9} s^{-1} (equivalent to a\nquality factor roughly constrained to the interval 5<Q<50). The stars have\nrelaxation similar to the hot Jupiters and their rotation is also driven to the\nonly stationary solution existing in these cases. However, solar-type stars may\nlose angular momentum due to stellar wind, braking the rotation and displacing\nthe attractor towards larger periods. Old active host stars with big close-in\ncompanions generally have rotational periods larger than the orbital periods of\nthe companions.

The claim of a nonzero B, which is made on the basis of a normal mode\nanalysis of periodic Penrose approximants for a single value of the disorder\nepsilon, is the central point of their letter: other properties of Penrose\ntilings, such as the vanishing of the shear modulus, and a flat density of\nvibrational states, are already shared by most geometrically disordered\nisostatic networks studied so far. In this comment, Conjugate Gradient is used\nto solve the elastic equations on approximants with up to 8x10^4 sites for\nseveral values of epsilon, to show beyond reasonable doubt that Stenull and\nLubensky's claim is incorrect. The bulk modulus of generic Penrose tilings is\nzero asymptotically. According to our results, B grows as (epsilon^2 L^3) when\n(epsilon^2 L^3) << 10^2, then saturates, and finally decays as (epsilon^2\nL^3)^{-2/3} ~ 1/L^2 for epsilon^2 L^3 >> 10^2. Stenull and Lubensky seem to\nhave only analyzed one value of epsilon for which saturation is reached at the\nlargest size studied. This led them to a wrong conclusion. We support our\nresults by also considering generic Penrose approximants with fixed boundaries,\nwhose bulk modulus constitutes a strict upper bound for that of periodic\nsystems, finding that these have a vanishing B as well for large L.

In this article we make comparisons between different global (unresolved)\nmeasures of the Sun's magnetic activity, to investigate how they are responding\nto this weak-activity epoch. We focus on helioseismic data, which are sensitive\nto conditions, including the characteristics of the magnetic field, in the\nsolar interior. Also considered are measures of the magnetic field in the\nphotosphere (sunspot number and sunspot area), the chromosphere and corona\n(10.7cm radio flux and 530.3nm green coronal index), and two measures of the\nSun's magnetic activity closer to Earth (the interplanetary magnetic field and\nthe galactic cosmic-ray intensity). Scaled versions of the activity proxies\ndiverge from the helioseismic data around 2000, indicating a change in\nrelationship between the proxies. The degree of divergence varies from proxy to\nproxy with sunspot area and 10.7cm flux showing only small deviations, while\nsunspot number, coronal index, and the two interplanetary proxies show much\nlarger departures. In Cycle 24 the deviations in the solar proxies and the\nhelioseismic data decrease, raising the possibility that the deviations\nobserved in Cycle 23 are just symptomatic of a 22-year Hale cycle. However, the\ndeviations in the helioseismic data and the interplanetary proxies increase in\nCycle 24. Interestingly the divergence in the solar proxies and the\nhelioseismic data are not reflected in the shorter-term variations (often\nreferred to as quasi-biennial oscillations) observed on top of the dominant\n11-year solar cycle. However, despite being highly correlated in Cycle 22, the\nshort-term variations in the interplanetary proxies show very little\ncorrelation with the helioseismic data during Cycles 23 and 24.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Solar Physics, 18 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Considering the current attacking landscape, it is\nclear that developing secure software should be a main concern in all software\ndevelopment projects. In traditional software projects, security issues require\ndetailed planning in an initial planning phase, typically resulting in a\ndetailed security analysis (e.g., threat and risk analysis), a security\narchitecture, and instructions for security implementation (e.g., specification\nof key sizes and cryptographic algorithms to use). Agile software development\nmethods like Scrum are known for reducing the initial planning phases (e.g.,\nsprint 0 in Scrum) and for focusing more on producing running code. Scrum is\nalso known for allowing fast adaption of the emerging software to changes of\ncustomer wishes. For security, this means that it is likely that there are no\ndetailed security architecture or security implementation instructions from the\nstart of the project. It also means that a lot of design decisions will be made\nduring the runtime of the project. Hence, to address security in Scrum, it is\nnecessary to consider security issues throughout the whole software development\nprocess. Secure Scrum is a variation of the Scrum framework with special focus\non the development of secure software throughout the whole software development\nprocess. It puts emphasis on implementation of security related issues without\nthe need of changing the underlying Scrum process or influencing team dynamics.\nSecure Scrum allows even non- security experts to spot security issues, to\nimplement security features, and to verify implementations. A field test of\nSecure Scrum shows that the security level of software developed using Secure\nScrum is higher then the security level of software developed using standard\nScrum.\n","Comment: The Ninth International Conference on Emerging Security Information,\n  Systems and Technologies - SECURWARE 2015, Venice, Italy, 2015"]}]
