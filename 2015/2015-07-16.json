The underlying idea of asynchronous methods is to avoid processor\nidle time by allowing the processors to continue to make progress even if not\nall progress made by other processors has been communicated to them.\n  Historically, the applicability of asynchronous methods for solving linear\nequations was limited to certain restricted classes of matrices, such as\ndiagonally dominant matrices. Furthermore, analysis of these methods focused on\nproving convergence in the limit. Comparison of the asynchronous convergence\nrate with its synchronous counterpart and its scaling with the number of\nprocessors were seldom studied, and are still not well understood.\n  In this paper, we propose a randomized shared-memory asynchronous method for\ngeneral symmetric positive definite matrices. We rigorously analyze the\nconvergence rate and prove that it is linear, and is close to that of the\nmethod's synchronous counterpart if the processor count is not excessive\nrelative to the size and sparsity of the matrix. We also present an algorithm\nfor unsymmetric systems and overdetermined least-squares.

Nevertheless, in this case, the tight connection to logic and\nproof theory is lost. In this work, we give a proof theoretical interpretation\nto soft constraints: they can be defined as formulas in a suitable fragment of\nILL with subexponentials (SELL) where subexponentials, ordered in a c-semiring\nstructure, are interpreted as preferences. We hence achieve two goals: (1)\nobtain a CCP language where agents can tell and ask soft constraints and (2)\nprove that the language in (1) has a strong connection with logic. Hence we\nkeep a declarative reading of processes as formulas while providing a logical\nframework for soft-CCP based systems.

The two regimes are separated by a limit in X-ray luminosity at about\n4 10^{36} erg/s. In subsonic accretion, which works a hot quasi-spherical shell\nmust form around the magnetosphere, and the actual accretion rate onto the NS\nis determined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Two regimes of subsonic accretion are\npossible, depending on the plasma cooling mechanism (Compton or radiative) near\nthe magnetopshere. The transition from the high-luminosity regime with Compton\ncooling to the low-luminosity (L_x < 3\\times 10^35 erg/s) regime with radiative\ncooling can be responsible for the onset of the 'off' states repeatedly\nobserved in several X-ray pulsars, such as Vela X-1, GX 301-2 and 4U 1907+09.\nThe triggering of the transition may be due to a switch in the X-ray beam\npattern in response to a change in the optical depth in the accretion column\nwith changing luminosity.

In this scenario, two phases\nwith different diffusivities coexist for a time of the order of the relaxation\ntime and mix afterwards. Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure the\nsingle-particle diffusivities to test this hypothesis. Indeed, although the\nnon-Gaussian shape of the van-Hove distribution suggests the transient\nexistence of a diffusivity distribution, it is not possible to infer from this\nquantity whether two or more dynamical phases coexist. Here we provide the\nfirst direct observation of the dynamical coexistence of two phases with\ndifferent diffusivities, by showing that in the deeply supercooled regime the\ndistribution of the single-particle diffusivities acquires a transient bimodal\nshape. We relate this distribution to the heterogeneity of the dynamics and to\nthe breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation, and we show that the coexistence\nof two dynamical phases occurs up to a timescale growing faster than the\nrelaxation time on cooling, for some of the considered models.

We show that suppression of bond order by impurities occurs through\nthe local disruption of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ form factor near individual\nimpurities. Unlike $d$-wave superconductors, where the sensitivity of $T_c$ to\nimpurities can be traced to a vanishing average of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ order\nparameter over the Fermi surface, the response of bond order to impurities is\ndictated by a few Fermi surface \"hotspots\". The bond order transition\ntemperature $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ thus follows a different universal dependence on\nimpurity concentration $n_i$ than does the superconducting $T_c$. In\nparticular, $T_\\mathrm{bo}$ decreases more rapidly than $T_c$ with increasing\n$n_i$ when there is a nonzero Fermi surface curvature at the hotspots.

Since these\nwinds are considered to be driven by radiation pressure, it is theoretically\nexpected that the degree of the wind mass-loss depends on the initial\nmetallicity of WR stars. Following our comprehensive studies of WR stars in the\nMilky Way, M31, and the LMC, we derive stellar parameters and mass-loss rates\nfor all seven putatively single WN stars known in the SMC.

The quantitative analysis of the WN stars is performed\nwith the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. The physical\nproperties of our program stars are obtained from fitting synthetic spectra to\nmulti-band observations. In all SMC WN stars, a considerable surface hydrogen\nabundance is detectable. The majority of these objects have stellar\ntemperatures exceeding 75 kK, while their luminosities range from 10^5.5 to\n10^6.1 Lsun. The WN stars in the SMC exhibit on average lower mass-loss rates\nand weaker winds than their counterparts in the Milky Way, M31, and the LMC. By\ncomparing the mass-loss rates derived for WN stars in different Local Group\ngalaxies, we conclude that a clear dependence of the wind mass-loss on the\ninitial metallicity is evident, supporting the current paradigm that WR winds\nare driven by radiation. A metallicity effect on the evolution of massive stars\nis obvious from the HRD positions of the SMC WN stars at high temperatures and\nhigh luminosities.

The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable\nregion, where the system always reaches a fixed point equilibrium; (ii) a\nlocally unstable region, characterized by cycles and chaotic behavior; and\n(iii) a globally unstable region.

We construct a one parameter family\nof leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of\nBasel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to\ncountercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases.\nWe find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average\nleverage used by the bank; the relative size of the bank and the\nfundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise.

In order to enhance the QoS for these edge users, soft pilot\nreuse (SPR) combined with multi-cell block diagonalization (MBD) precoding are\nproposed. Specifically, the users are divided into two groups according to\ntheir large-scale fading coefficients, referred to as the center users, who\nonly suffer from modest pilot contamination and the edge users, who suffer from\nsevere pilot contamination. Based on this distinction, the SPR scheme is\nproposed for improving the QoS for the edge users, whereby a cell-center pilot\ngroup is reused for all cell-center users in all cells, while a cell-edge pilot\ngroup is applied for the edge users in the adjacent cells. By extending the\nclassical block diagonalization precoding to a multi-cell scenario, the MBD\nprecoding scheme projects the downlink transmit signal onto the null space of\nthe subspace spanned by the inter-cell channels of the edge users in adjacent\ncells. Thus, the inter-cell interference contaminating the edge users' signals\nin the adjacent cells can be efficiently mitigated and hence the QoS of these\nedge users can be further enhanced.

The assumption that lies at\nthe foundation of this approach to quantum tomography claims that time\nevolution of an open quantum system can be expressed by the Kossakowski -\nLindblad equation of the form $\\dot{\\rho} = \\mathbb{L} \\rho$, which is the most\ngeneral type of Markovian and time-homogeneous master equation which preserves\ntrace and positivity. We consider the cases when the generator of evolution can\nbe presented by means of two or more double commutators. Determining the\nminimal number of observables required for quantum tomography can be the first\nstep towards optimal tomography models for $N-$level quantum systems.\n"]}]
