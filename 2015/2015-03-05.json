The engine operates in quantum Otto cycle where the working\nmedium is coupled to classical heat baths in the isochoric processes of the\nfour stroke cycle; while either the coupling strength or the resonance\nfrequency is changed in the adiabatic stages. We found that such an engine can\nproduce work with an efficiency close to Carnot bound when it operates at low\ntemperatures and in the ultrastrong coupling regime. Interplay of quantum\ncoherence and quantum correlations on the engine performance is discussed in\nterms of second order coherence, quantum mutual information and logarithmic\nnegativity of entanglement. We point out that the proposed quantum Otto engine\ncan be implemented experimentally with the modern circuit quantum\nelectrodynamic systems where flux qubits can be coupled ultrastrongly to\nsuperconducting transmission line resonators.\n"]}]

The results revealed significant\ndifferences, but also unexpected similarities between the WR populations of\nthese different galaxies. Analyzing the WR stars in M31 will extend our\nunderstanding of these objects in different galactic environments. Aims: The\npresent study aims at the late-type WN stars in M31. The stellar and wind\nparameters will tell about the formation of WR stars in other galaxies with\ndifferent metallicity and star formation histories. The obtained parameters\nwill provide constraints to the evolution of massive stars in the environment\nof M31. Methods: We used the latest version of the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet model\natmosphere code to analyze the stars via fitting optical spectra and\nphotometric data. To account for the relatively low temperatures of the late\nWN10 and WN11 subtypes, our WN models have been extended into this temperature\nregime. Results: Stellar and atmospheric parameters are derived for all known\nlate-type WN stars in M31 with available spectra. All of these stars still have\nhydrogen in their outer envelopes, some of them up to 50% by mass. The stars\nare located on the cool side of the zero age main sequence in the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram, while their luminosities range from $10^5$ to\n$10^6$ Lsun. It is remarkable that no star exceeds $10^6$ Lsun. Conclusions: If\nformed via single-star evolution, the late-type WN stars in M31 stem from an\ninitial mass range between 20 and 60 Msun.

We then construct a\ncompatible gauging map for operators, which preserves locality and reproduces\nthe minimal coupling scheme for simple operators. By combining this\nconstruction with the formalism of projected entangled-pair states (PEPS), we\ncan show that an injective PEPS for the matter fields is gauged into a\nG-injective PEPS for the combined gauge-matter system, which potentially has\ntopological order. We derive the corresponding parent Hamiltonian, which is a\nfrustration free gauge theory Hamiltonian closely related to the Kogut-Susskind\nHamiltonian at zero coupling constant. We can then introduce gauge dynamics at\nfinite values of the coupling constant by applying a local filtering operation.\nThis scheme results in a low-parameter family of gauge invariant states of\nwhich we can accurately probe the phase diagram, as we illustrate by studying a\nZ2 gauge theory with Higgs matter.\n","Comment: restructured to better reflect the general and PEPS-specific part,\n  added supplementary material on injectivity in PEPS"]}]

Second-order perturbation theory implies that the effect is\nsmall, but suggests that formally the perturbation series may not converge. The\namplitude of the effect is actually determined by the ratio of the Hubble\nscales at matter-radiation equality and today - which are entirely unrelated.\nThis implies that a universe with significantly lower temperature today could\nhave significant backreaction from more power on small scales, and so provides\nthe ideal testing ground for understanding backreaction. We investigate this\nusing two different N-body numerical simulations - a 3D Newtonian and a 1D\nsimulation which includes all relevant relativistic effects.

We use\nthis interaction to calculate the electron thermal conductivity, electrical\nconductivity, and shear viscosity in the neutron star inner crust, and in the\ncore where we consider both normal and superfluid phases of neutron-rich\nmatter. In some cases, particularly when protons are superconducting and\nneutrons are in their normal phase, we find that electron-neutron scattering\ncan be more important than the other scattering mechanisms considered\npreviously.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Very soon after the\nphoto-excitation, the whole electrons are shown to exhibit a quite rapid\nrelaxation, like an avalanching phenomenon, mainly due to successive\nmulti-(optical and acoustic) phonon emission from them. Repeating this\nmulti-phonon process, the whole energy distribution of the electrons is shown\nto become a multi-peaked structure largely elongated over the lower part of the\nwide conduction band. However, after around 1 ps from the excitation, this\nrelaxation critically slows down, since the emission of a long-wave acoustic\nphonon from electrons around the Fermi level becomes prohibitively difficult.\nBy using the electron temperature approximation, we show that this slow\nrelaxation is inversely proportional to time. Thus, the formation of the\ncomplete Fermi degeneracy takes an infinite time. These theoretical results are\nquite consistent to the aforementioned recent experiment.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures"]}]

With this article we would like to draw attention\nto another source of new physics in Higgs+jet observables: the triple gluon\noperator $O_{3g}$ (consisting of three factors of the gluon field strength\ntensor). We compute the distortions of kinematic distributions in Higgs+jet\nproduction at a 14 TeV LHC due to $O_{3g}$ and compare them with the\ndistortions due to dimension six operators involving the Higgs doublet. We find\nthat the transverse momentum, the jet rapidity and the difference between the\nHiggs and jet rapidity are well suited to distinguish between the contributions\nfrom $O_{3g}$ and those from other operators, and that the size of the\ndistortions are similar if the Wilson coefficients are of the same order as the\nexpected bounds from other observables.

We fitted empirical transit times to individual\ntransit signals with significantly non-linear ephemerides for accurate recovery\nof transit parameters and measuring precise transit timing variations.

For a planet located at a resolvable\nangular distance from its host star, the starlight can be reduced up to several\norders of magnitude using adaptive optics and/or coronography. In addition, the\nremaining starlight can be filtered out using high-dispersion spectroscopy,\nutilizing the significantly different (or Doppler shifted) high-dispersion\nspectra of the planet and star. In this way, HDS+HCI can in principle reach\ncontrast limits of ~1e-5 x 1e-5, although in practice this will be limited by\nphoton noise and/or sky-background.\n  Methods: We present simulations of HDS+HCI observations with the E-ELT, both\nprobing thermal emission from a planet at infrared wavelengths, and starlight\nreflected off a planet atmosphere at optical wavelengths. For the infrared\nsimulations we use the baseline parameters of the E-ELT and METIS instrument,\nwith the latter combining extreme adaptive optics with an R=100,000 IFS. We\ninclude realistic models of the adaptive optics performance and atmospheric\ntransmission and emission.

The density parameter of the additional\nfluid is defined as a Gaussian function plus a constant in logarithmic\nscale-factor space. Searching for the best-fit cosmological parameters in the\npresence of such a dark energy spike gives a far smaller chi-square value by\nabout five times the number of additional parameters introduced and narrower\nconstraints on matter density and Hubble constant compared with the best-fit\n$\\Lambda\\textrm{CDM}$ model.

The\nLagrangians are nonnatural and the forces are not derivable from a potential.\nThe constant value $E$ of a preserved energy function can be used as an\nappropriate parameter for characterizing the behaviour of the solutions of\nthese two systems. In the second part the existence of two--dimensional\nversions endowed with superintegrability is proved. The explicit expressions of\nthe additional integrals are obtained in both cases. Finally it is proved that\nthe orbits of the second system, that represents a nonlinear oscillator, can be\nconsidered as nonlinear Lissajous figures\n","Comment: 25 pages, 7 figures"]}]
