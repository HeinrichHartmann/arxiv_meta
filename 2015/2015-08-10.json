Monte Carlo sampling can be used with a power system\nmodel to estimate this impact, but doing so is computationally expensive. This\npaper presents a new approach to estimating the risk of large cascading\nblackouts triggered by multiple contingencies. The method uses a search\nalgorithm (Random Chemistry) to identify blackout-causing contingencies, and\nthen combines the results with outage probabilities to estimate overall risk.\nComparing this approach with Monte Carlo sampling for two test cases (the IEEE\nRTS-96 and a 2383 bus model of the Polish system) illustrates that the new\napproach is at least two orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo, without\nintroducing measurable bias. Moreover, the approach enables one to compute the\nsensitivity of overall blackout risk to individual component-failure\nprobabilities in the initiating contingency, allowing one to quickly identify\nlow-cost strategies for reducing risk. By computing the sensitivity of risk to\nindividual initial outage probabilities for the Polish system, we found that\nreducing three line-outage probabilities by 50% would reduce cascading failure\nrisk by 33%.

From\nsome results of Bollob\\'as and {\\L}uczak, we know that {\\bf a.a.s.}\n$\\chi(G(N,p)) = \\Theta((N/\\log N)^{1-1/\\Delta})$.\n  In this paper, we shall show that the $G(N,p)$ in above result can be\nreplaced by random multipartite graph. Let $K_{r}(N)$ be the complete\n$r$-partite graph with $N$ vertices in each part, and $G_r(N,p)$ the random\nspanning subgraph of $K_r(N)$, in which each edge appears with probability $p$.\nIt is shown that for fixed $\\Delta\\ge2$ there exist constants $r, B$ and $C$\ndepending only on $\\Delta$ such that if $N\\ge Bn$ and $p=C(\\log\nN/N)^{1/\\Delta}$, then {\\bf a.a.s.} $G_r(N,p)$ is partition universal graph for\n$\\mathcal{H}(\\Delta,n)$.
