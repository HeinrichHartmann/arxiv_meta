However, multipole space determinations are\nsubject to many difficulties, and a real-space analysis can provide a\nstraightforward alternative. In this work we describe a numerical method for\nremoving Lorentz- boost effects from real-space temperature maps. We show that\nto deboost a map so that one can accurately extract the temperature power\nspectrum requires calculating the boost kernel at a finer pixelization than one\nmight naively expect. In idealized cases that allow for easy comparison to\nanalytic results, we have confirmed that there is indeed mode mixing among the\nspherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature. We find that using a boost\nkernel calculated at Nside=8192 leads to a 1% bias in the binned boosted power\nspectrum at l~2000, while individual Cls exhibit ~5% fluctuations around the\nbinned average. However, this bias is dominated by pixelization effects and not\nthe aberration and Doppler shift of CMB photons that causes the fluctuations.\nPerforming analysis on maps with galactic cuts does not induce any additional\nerror in the boosted, binned power spectra over the full sky analysis. For\nmultipoles that are free of resolution effects, there is no detectable\ndeviation between the binned boosted and unboosted spectra.

Such time- invariant properties are generally\ninteresting, because they tend to reflect some fundamental processes or\nconstraints behind Internet growth. As has been shown before, the\ntime-invariant structural properties of the Internet include some most basic\nones, such as the degree distribution or clustering. Here we add to this\ntime-invariant list a non-trivial property - k-dense decomposition. This\nproperty is derived from a recursive form of edge multiplicity, defined as the\nnumber of triangles that share a given edge. We show that after proper\nnormalization, the k- dense decomposition of the Internet has remained stable\nover the last decade, even though the Internet size has approximately doubled,\nand so has the k-density of its k-densest core. This core consists mostly of\ncontent providers peering at Internet eXchange Points, and it only loosely\noverlaps with the high-degree or high-rank AS core, consisting mostly of tier-1\ntransit providers. We thus show that high degrees and high k-densities reflect\ntwo different Internet-specific properties of ASes (transit versus content\nproviders). As a consequence, even though degrees and k-densities of nodes are\ncorrelated, the relative fluctuations are strong, and related to that, random\ngraphs with the same degree distribution or even degree correlations as in the\nInternet, do not reproduce its k-dense decomposition. Therefore an interesting\nopen question is what Internet topology models or generators can fully explain\nor at least reproduce the k-dense properties of the Internet.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

For channels without input constraints, various estimates on the\namount of such contraction are known, Dobrushin's coefficient for the total\nvariation being perhaps the most well-known. This work investigates channels\nwith average input cost constraint. It is found that while the contraction\ncoefficient typically equals one (no contraction), the information nevertheless\ndissipates. A certain non-linear function, the \\emph{Dobrushin curve} of the\nchannel, is proposed to quantify the amount of dissipation. Tools for\nevaluating the Dobrushin curve of additive-noise channels are developed based\non coupling arguments. Some basic applications in stochastic control,\nuniqueness of Gibbs measures and fundamental limits of noisy circuits are\ndiscussed.\n  As an application, it shown that in the chain of $n$ power-constrained relays\nand Gaussian channels the end-to-end mutual information and maximal squared\ncorrelation decay as $\\Theta(\\frac{\\log\\log n}{\\log n})$, which is in stark\ncontrast with the exponential decay in chains of discrete channels. Similarly,\nthe behavior of noisy circuits (composed of gates with bounded fan-in) and\nbroadcasting of information on trees (of bounded degree) does not experience\nthreshold behavior in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Clear gamma-ray detections are\nobtained only when components are moving in a direction closer to our line of\nsight.This suggests that the observed gamma-ray emission depends not only on\nthe interaction of moving components with the mm-VLBI core, but also on their\norientation with respect to the observer. Timing of the gamma-ray detections\nand ejection of superluminal components locate the gamma-ray production to\nwithin almost 0.13 pc from the mm-VLBI core, which was previously estimated to\nlie about 0.24 pc from the central black hole. This corresponds to about twice\nthe estimated extension of the broad line region, limiting the external photon\nfield and therefore suggesting synchrotron self Compton as the most probable\nmechanism for the production of the gamma-ray emission. Alternatively, the\ninteraction of components with the jet sheath can provide the necessary photon\nfield to produced the observed gamma-rays by Compton scattering.\n","Comment: Already accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal"]}]

While\nprevious work has proposed application-aware memory scheduling as a solution to\nmitigate inter-application interference and improve system performance,\npreviously proposed memory scheduling techniques incur high hardware complexity\nand unfairly slowdown some applications. Furthermore, previously proposed\nmemory-interference mitigation techniques are not designed to precisely control\napplication performance.\n  This dissertation seeks to achieve high and controllable performance in\nmulticore systems by mitigating and quantifying the impact of shared resource\ninterference. First, towards mitigating memory interference and achieving high\nperformance, we propose the Blacklisting memory scheduler that achieves high\nperformance and fairness at low complexity. Next, towards quantifying the\nimpact of memory interference and achieving controllable performance in the\npresence of memory bandwidth interference, we propose the Memory Interference\ninduced Slowdown Estimation (MISE) model. We propose and demonstrate two use\ncases that can leverage MISE to provide soft performance guarantees and high\noverall performance/fairness. Finally, we seek to quantify the impact of shared\ncache interference on application slowdowns, in addition to memory bandwidth\ninterference. Towards this end, we propose the Application Slowdown Model\n(ASM). We propose and demonstrate several use cases of ASM that leverage it to\nprovide soft performance guarantees and improve performance and fairness.\n","Comment: CMU PhD Thesis"]}]

ER is the process of determining records (mentions) in\na database that correspond to the same real-world entity.

A major component of\npersonalized medicine is the estimation of individualized treatment rules\n(ITRs). Recently, Zhao et al.

Although OWL\nopens the door to introducing machine learning techniques to optimal treatment\nregimes, it still has some problems in performance. In this article, we propose\na general framework, called Residual Weighted Learning (RWL), to improve finite\nsample performance. Unlike OWL which weights misclassification errors by\nclinical outcomes, RWL weights these errors by residuals of the outcome from a\nregression fit on clinical covariates excluding treatment assignment. We\nutilize the smoothed ramp loss function in RWL, and provide a difference of\nconvex (d.c.) algorithm to solve the corresponding non-convex optimization\nproblem. By estimating residuals with linear models or generalized linear\nmodels, RWL can effectively deal with different types of outcomes, such as\ncontinuous, binary and count outcomes. We also propose variable selection\nmethods for linear and nonlinear rules, respectively, to further improve the\nperformance. We show that the resulting estimator of the treatment rule is\nconsistent. We further obtain a rate of convergence for the difference between\nthe expected outcome using the estimated ITR and that of the optimal treatment\nrule.
