The LSST design is\ndriven by four main science themes: probing dark energy and dark matter, taking\nan inventory of the Solar System, exploring the transient optical sky, and\nmapping the Milky Way. LSST will be a wide-field ground-based system designed\nto obtain multiple images covering the sky visible from Cerro Pach\\'{o}n in\nnorthern Chile. The telescope will have an 8.4 m (6.5 m effective) primary\nmirror, a 9.6 deg$^2$ field of view, and a 3.2 Gigapixel camera. This system\ncan image about 10,000 square degrees of sky in three clear nights using pairs\nof 15-second exposures twice per night, with typical 5$\\sigma$ depth for point\nsources of $r\\sim24.5$ (AB). The project is in the construction phase and will\nbegin regular survey operations by 2022.

We use the STOKES radiative\ntransfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and\ntorus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and\nthe ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the\ngeometry of the scattering region. If correct, this model resolves the\nlong-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by\nvelocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the\nblueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the\ninflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the\nouter accretion disk and that similar MHD processes are operating. In the\nscattering model the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so\nhigh-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts as\nis observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass\nestimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line\nregion (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a\nsimilar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad\nabsorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from\nthe BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering\nfor predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh\nscattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line\nprofiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, Astrophysical Journal in press.

A particularly powerful aspect of the IST is\nits ability to predict the large $t$ behavior of the solution.

A major complication of IBV problems is that the computation of the\nshapes and speeds of the solitons involves the solution of a {\\it nonlinear}\nVolterra integral equation.

Realistic geometries are\nconsidered, including circular and elliptical dot shapes, parallel and\nperpendicular magnetic fields, and (most importantly for valley coupling) the\nsmall local tilt of the quantum well interface away from the crystallographic\naxes. In absence of a tilt, valley splitting occurs only between pairs of\nstates with the same orbital quantum numbers.

In\nthis context, \"valley splitting\" is no longer a well defined concept, and the\nquantity of merit for qubit applications becomes the ground state gap. For\ntypical dots used as qubits, a rich energy spectrum emerges, as a function of\nmagnetic field, tilt angle, and orbital quantum number.

Assuming that\nthe PR link adapts its transmit power and/or rate upon receiving an\ninterference signal from the CR and such transmit adaptations are observable by\nthe CR, this results in a new form of feedback from the PR to CR, refereed to\nas hidden PR feedback, whereby the CR learns the PR's strategy for transmit\nadaptations without the need of a dedicated feedback channel from the PR. In\nthis paper, we exploit the hidden PR feedback to design new learning and\ntransmission schemes for spectrum sharing based CRs, namely active learning and\nsupervised transmission. For active learning, the CR initiatively sends a\nprobing signal to interfere with the PR, and from the observed PR transmit\nadaptations the CR estimates the channel gain from its transmitter to the PR\nreceiver, which is essential for the CR to control its interference to the PR\nduring the subsequent data transmission. This paper proposes a new transmission\nprotocol for the CR to implement the active learning and the solutions to deal\nwith various practical issues for implementation, such as time synchronization,\nrate estimation granularity, power measurement noise, and channel variation.\nFurthermore, with the acquired knowledge from active learning, the CR designs a\nsupervised data transmission by effectively controlling the interference powers\nboth to and from the PR, so as to achieve the optimum performance tradeoffs for\nthe PR and CR links.

Both have pros and cons, which we demonstrate\nthrough a comparison to each other as well as to the \"ground truth.\" In\ncontrast, using Breadth-First-Search (BFS) or an unadjusted Random Walk (RW)\nleads to substantially biased results. Second, and in addition to offline\nperformance assessment, we introduce online formal convergence diagnostics to\nassess sample quality during the data collection process. We show how these\ndiagnostics can be used to effectively determine when a random walk sample is\nof adequate size and quality. Third, as a case study, we apply the above\nmethods to Facebook and we collect the first, to the best of our knowledge,\nrepresentative sample of Facebook users. We make it publicly available and\nemploy it to characterize several key properties of Facebook.\n","Comment: published in IEEE INFOCOM '10; IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in\n  Communications (JSAC), Special Issue on Measurement of Internet Topologies,\n  2011 under the title \"Practical Recommendations on Crawling Online Social\n  Networks\""]}]

Aims: We aim to compare the general relativistic (GR)\nresults by other groups with Newtonian calculations of models with equivalent\nparameters. We vary the mass ratios between NS and BH and the compactness of\nthe NS. The mass of the NS is 1.4 M_sol. We compare the dynamics in the\nparameter-space regions where the NS is expected to reach the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) before being tidally disrupted (mass shedding, MS) and\nvice versa. Methods: The hydrodynamics is evolved by a Newtonian PPM scheme\nwith four levels of nested grids. We use a polytropic EoS (Gamma=2), as was\ndone in the GR simulations. However, instead of full GR we use a Newtonian\npotential supplemented by a Paczynski-Wiita-Artemova potential for the BH, both\ndisregarding and including rotation of the BH. Results: If the NS is compact\n(C=0.18) it is accreted by the BH more quickly, and only a small amount of mass\nremains outside the BH. If the mass ratio is small (Q=2 or 3) or the NS is less\ncompact (C=0.16 or less) the NS is tidally torn apart before being accreted.\nAlthough most of the mass is absorbed by the BH, some 0.1 M_sol remain in a\ntidal arm. For small mass ratios the tidal arm can wrap around the BH to form a\nthick disk. When including the effects of BH spin-up or spin-down by the\naccreted matter, more mass remains in the surroundings (0.2-0.3 M_sol).\nConclusions: Although details and quantitative results differ, the general\ntrends of our Newtonian calculations are similar to the GR calculations.

We find no evidence for gravitational-wave burst signals\nassociated with this sample of GRBs. Using simulated short-duration (<1 s)\nwaveforms, we set upper limits on the amplitude of gravitational waves\nassociated with each GRB.

Our aim is to construct a procedure that makes no explicit\nassumptions, but still providing an accurate estimate of the density. We\nintroduce the self-consistent estimate: the power spectrum of a candidate\ndensity is given, and an estimation procedure is constructed on the assumption,\nto be released \\emph{a posteriori}, that the candidate is correct. The\nself-consistent estimate is defined as a prior candidate density that precisely\nreproduces itself. Our main result is to derive the exact expression of the\nself-consistent estimate for any given dataset, and to study its properties.\nApplications of the method require neither priors on the form of the density\nnor the subjective choice of parameters. A cutoff frequency, akin to a bin size\nor a kernel bandwidth, emerges naturally from the derivation.

While the generic spin-down age may give realistic estimates for\nnormal pulsars, it can fail for pulsars with very short periods. Details of the\nspin-up process during the low mass X-ray binary phase pose additional\nconstraints on the period (P) and spin-down rates (Pdot) that may consequently\naffect the age estimate. Here, we propose a new recipe to estimate millisecond\npulsar (MSP) ages that parametrically incorporates constraints arising from\nbinary evolution and limiting physics. We show that the standard method can be\nimproved by this approach to achieve age estimates closer to the true age\nwhilst the standard spin-down age may over- or under-estimate the age of the\npulsar by more than a factor of ~10 in the millisecond regime.

The standard upwind time evolution with a CFL-limited time step\nresults in spurious oscillations at the grid scale. These oscillations, which\noriginate at the extrema, propagate throughout the computational domain and are\nundamped even at late times. These oscillations arise because of unphysically\nlarge fluxes leaving (entering) the maxima (minima) with the standard\nCFL-limited explicit methods.

Void radii below 300 Mpc are\nconsidered, which are supported by current redshift surveys and limited by the\nrecently observed imprint such voids leave on CMB. The averaging over all\ndirections, performed by numerical ray tracing, is non-perturbative and\nincludes the supernovas inside the voids.

Such corrections are destroyed by the averaging over all\ndirections, even in non-randomized simple cubic void lattices. At low\nredshifts, the average correction is not zero but decays with the peculiar\nvelocities and redshift.

A transition is generally observed from a\ntime-homogeneous dynamical regime to an aging regime where physical changes\noccur intermittently and, on average, at a decreasing rate. It has been\nsuggested that a global change of the independent time variable to its\nlogarithm may render the aging dynamics homogeneous: for colloids, this entails\ndiffusion but on a logarithmic time scale. Our novel analysis of experimental\ncolloid data confirms that the mean square displacement grows linearly in time\nat low densities and shows that it grows linearly in the logarithm of time at\nhigh densities. Correspondingly, pairs of particles initially in close contact\nsurvive as pairs with a probability which decays exponentially in either time\nor its logarithm. The form of the Probability Density Function of the\ndisplacements shows that long-ranged spatial correlations are very long-lived\nin dense colloids. A phenomenological stochastic model is then introduced which\nrelies on the growth and collapse of strongly correlated clusters (\"dynamic\nheterogeneity\"), and which reproduces the full spectrum of observed colloidal\nbehaviors depending on the form assumed for the probability that a cluster\ncollapses during a Monte Carlo update. In the limit where large clusters\ndominate, the collapse rate is ~1/t, implying a homogeneous, log-Poissonian\nprocess that qualitatively reproduces the experimental results for dense\ncolloids.

Whipple first noted that planetesimal growth by\nparticle agglomeration is strongly influenced by gas drag; there is a\n\"bottleneck\" at the meter scale with such bodies rapidly spiraling into the\ncentral star, whereas much smaller or larger particles do not. Thus, successful\nplanetary accretion requires rapid planetesimal growth to km scale. A commonly\naccepted picture is that for collisional velocities $V_c$ above a certain\nthreshold collisional velocity, ${V_{th}} \\sim$ 0.1-10 cm s$^{-1}$, particle\nagglomeration is not possible; elastic rebound overcomes attractive surface and\nintermolecular forces. However, if perfect sticking is assumed for all\ncollisions the bottleneck can be overcome by rapid planetesimal growth. While\nprevious work has dealt explicitly with the influences of collisional pressures\nand the possibility of particle fracture or penetration, the basic role of the\nphase behavior of matter--phase diagrams, amorphs and polymorphs--has been\nneglected. Here it is demonstrated that novel aspects of surface phase\ntransitions provide a physical basis for efficient sticking through collisional\nmelting or amphorph-/polymorphization and fusion to extend the collisional\nvelocity range of primary accretion to $\\Delta V_c \\sim$ 1-100 m s$^{-1}$,\nwhich bound both turbulent RMS speeds and the velocity differences between\nboulder sized and small grains $\\sim$ 1-50 m s$^{-1}$. Thus, as inspiraling\nmeter sized bodies collide with smaller particles in this high velocity\ncollisional fusion regime they grow rapidly to km scales and hence settle into\nstable Keplerian orbits in $\\sim$ 10$^5$ years before photoevaporative wind\nclears the disk of source material.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"]}]

We have\nclassified the members of Taurus according to whether they show evidence of\ndisks and envelopes (classes I, II, and III). The disk fraction in Taurus is\n75% for solar-mass stars and declines to 45% for low-mass stars and brown\ndwarfs (0.01-0.3 M_sun). This dependence on stellar mass is similar to that\nmeasured for Cha I, although the disk fraction in Taurus is slightly higher\noverall, probably because of its younger age (1 vs. 2-3 Myr). In comparison,\nthe disk fraction for solar-mass stars is much lower (20%) in IC 348 and Sigma\nOri, which are denser than Taurus and Cha I and are roughly coeval with the\nlatter. These data indicate that disk lifetimes for solar-mass stars are longer\nin regions that have lower stellar densities. Through an analysis of multiple\nepochs of photometry that are available for ~200 Taurus members, we find that\nstars with disks exhibit significantly greater mid-IR variability than diskless\nstars. Finally, we have used our data in Taurus to refine the criteria for\nprimordial, evolved, and transitional disks. The number ratio of evolved and\ntransitional disks to primordial disks in Taurus is 15/98 for K5-M5, indicating\na timescale of 0.15 x tau(primordial)=0.45 Myr for the clearing of the inner\nregions of optically thick disks.

Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental\nimportance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies\nhave focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which\nstrongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social\ncontacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of\nconfirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's\nlaw and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a\nhierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to\ncountries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control\neffects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the\nneed of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the\nimpact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the\nmodel and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical\nspreading properties observed in empirical data.\n  Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although\nstrict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in\nthe regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention\nafter the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the\nlargest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the\nspreading.

The time evolution follows from\nthe fact that each modelled galaxy approaches a steady state where the SFR\nfollows the (net) cold gas accretion rate. The key feature of the model is a\nhalo mass floor M_{min}~10^{11} below which accretion is quenched in order to\nsimultaneously account for the observed slopes of the SFR-Mass and\nTully-Fischer relations. The same successes cannot be achieved via a\nstar-formation threshold (or delay) nor by varying the SF efficiency or the\nfeedback efficiency. Combined with the mass ceiling for cold accretion due to\nvirial shock heating, the mass floor M_{min} explains galaxy \"downsizing\",\nwhere more massive galaxies formed earlier and over a shorter period of time.\nIt turns out that the model also accounts for the observed galactic baryon and\ngas fractions as a function of mass and time, and the cosmic SFR density from\nz~6 to z=0, which are all resulting from the mass floor M_{min}. The model\nhelps to understand that it is the cosmological decline of accretion rate that\ndrives the decrease of cosmic SFR density between z~2 and z=0 and the rise of\nthe cosmic SFR density allows us to put a constraint on our main parameter\nM_{min}~10^{11} solar masses.

The goal is to design a coding scheme that makes it possible for\nAlice to communicate both reliably and securely. Reliability is measured in\nterms of Bob's probability of error in recovering the message, while security\nis measured in terms of Eve's equivocation ratio. Wyner showed that the\nsituation is characterized by a single constant C_s, called the secrecy\ncapacity, which has the following meaning: for all $\\epsilon > 0$, there exist\ncoding schemes of rate $R \\ge C_s - \\epsilon$ that asymptotically achieve both\nthe reliability and the security objectives. However, his proof of this result\nis based upon a nonconstructive random-coding argument. To date, despite a\nconsiderable research effort, the only case where we know how to construct\ncoding schemes that achieve secrecy capacity is when Eve's channel C_2 is an\nerasure channel, or a combinatorial variation thereof.\n  Polar codes were recently invented by Arikan; they approach the capacity of\nsymmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels with low encoding and\ndecoding complexity. Herein, we use polar codes to construct a coding scheme\nthat achieves the secrecy capacity for a wide range of wiretap channels. Our\nconstruction works for any instantiation of the wiretap channel model, as long\nas both C_1 and C_2 are symmetric and binary-input, and C_2 is degraded with\nrespect to C_1. Moreover, we show how to modify our construction in order to\nprovide strong security, in the sense defined by Maurer, while still operating\nat a rate that approaches the secrecy capacity. In this case, we cannot\nguarantee that the reliability condition will be satisfied unless the main\nchannel C_1 is noiseless, although we believe it can be always satisfied in\npractice.\n","Comment: 15 pages, to appear in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]

This widely used approximation assumes that the mass\nfunction can be expressed as a function of the matter density omega_m and the\nrms linear density fluctuation sigma only, with no explicit dependence on the\nproperties of dark energy or redshift. In order to test this hypothesis we run\na series of 15 high-resolution N-body simulations for different cosmological\nmodels.

These toy\nmodels have very different evolutionary histories at the background and linear\nlevel, but share the same sigma8 value. For each of these models we measure the\nmass function from catalogues of halos identified in the simulations using the\nFriend-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm. We find redshift dependent deviations from a\nuniversal behaviour, well above numerical uncertainties and of non-stochastic\norigin, which are correlated with the linear growth factor of the investigated\ncosmologies.

For practical applications, we provide a fitting\nformula of the mass function accurate to 5 percents over the all range of\ninvestigated cosmologies. We also derive an empirical relation between the FoF\nlinking parameter and the virial overdensity which can account for most of the\ndeviations from an exact universal behavior.

In this paper, we\nmodel different types of random network communications as the transmission of\nflats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us\nto introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding\n(RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously\nproposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we\nfirst evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in\nthe error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and\nthroughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of\npartial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC\noutperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more\nefficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible\nalterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which\ngeneralizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus\nreduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct\nmetrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of\ncodes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in\nparticular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on\nrank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm.

Such a Z_3-charged\n\"mother\" particle can decay into one or two DM particles along with the same SM\nparticles. This can be contrasted with the decay of a Z_2-charged mother\nparticle, where only one DM particle appears. Thus, if the intermediate\nparticles in these decay chains are off-shell, then the reconstructed invariant\nmass of the SM particles exhibits two kinematic edges for the Z_3 case but only\none for the Z_2 case. For the case of on-shell intermediate particles,\ndistinguishing the two symmetries requires more than the kinematic edges.

The most\nconfident among these estimates are the rate predictions for coalescing binary\nneutron stars which are based on extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in\nour Galaxy. These yield a likely coalescence rate of 100 per Myr per Milky Way\nEquivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1 per\nMyr per MWEG to 1000 per Myr per MWEG. We convert coalescence rates into\ndetection rates based on data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and\nprojected sensitivities for our Advanced detectors. Using the detector\nsensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate of 0.02\nper year for Initial LIGO-Virgo interferometers, with a plausible range between\n0.0002 and 0.2 per year. The likely binary neutron-star detection rate for the\nAdvanced LIGO-Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range\nbetween 0.4 and 400 per year.\n"]}]

Analysis of the relation between the apparent\nspeed of the jet and the optical nuclear luminosity at 5100 AA supports the\nrelativistic beaming model for the optical emission generated in the jet, and\nallows the peak values of the intrinsic optical luminosity of the jet and its\nLorentz factor to be estimated for the populations of quasars, BL Lacs, and\nradio galaxies. The radio-loudness of quasars is found to increase at high\nredshifts, which can be a result of lower efficiency of the accretion in AGN\nhaving higher radio luminosities.

Therefore,\nepistemic plausibility models have been introduced. Because these are much\nricher structures than Kripke models, they do not straightforwardly inherit the\nmodel-theoretical results of modal logic. Therefore, while epistemic\nplausibility structures are well-suited for modeling purposes, an extensive\ninvestigation of their model theory has been lacking so far. The aim of the\npresent paper is to fill exactly this gap, by initiating a systematic\nexploration of the model theory of epistemic plausibility models. Like in\n'ordinary' modal logic, the focus will be on the notion of bisimulation. We\ndefine various notions of bisimulations (parametrized by a language L) and show\nthat L-bisimilarity implies L-equivalence.

Although the process of condensation\nof scalar fields in the lab is fairly well understood, the extension of results\nto a cosmological context is not trivial. Here we investigate the formation of\na condensate - a classical scalar field - after reheating of the Universe. We\nassume a light quantum scalar field produced by the decay of a heavy particle,\nwhich for simplicity is assumed to be another scalar. We show that during\nradiation domination epoch under certain conditions, the decay of the heavy\nparticle alone is sufficient for the production of a condensate. This process\nis very similar to preheating - the exponential particle production at the end\nof inflation. During matter domination epoch when the expansion of the Universe\nis faster, the decay alone can not keep the growing trend of the field and the\namplitude of the condensate decreases rapidly, unless there is a self\ninteraction. This issue is particularly important for dark energy. We show that\nquantum corrections of the self-interaction play a crucial role in this\nprocess. Notably, they induce an effective action which includes inverse\npower-law terms, and therefore can lead to a tracking behaviour even when the\nclassical self-interaction is a simple power-law of order 3 or 4. This removes\nthe necessity of having nonrenormalisable terms in the Lagrangian.

Pebbling has proven a useful tool for studying\nresolution-based proof systems when comparing the strength of different\nsubsystems, showing bounds on proof space, and establishing size-space\ntrade-offs. The typical approach has been to encode the pebble game played on a\ngraph as a CNF formula and then argue that proofs of this formula must inherit\n(various aspects of) the pebbling properties of the underlying graph.\nUnfortunately, the reductions used here are not tight. To simulate resolution\nproofs by pebblings, the full strength of nondeterministic black-white pebbling\nis needed, whereas resolution is only known to be able to simulate\ndeterministic black pebbling. To obtain strong results, one therefore needs to\nfind specific graph families which either have essentially the same properties\nfor black and black-white pebbling (not at all true in general) or which admit\nsimulations of black-white pebblings in resolution. This paper contributes to\nboth these approaches. First, we design a restricted form of black-white\npebbling that can be simulated in resolution and show that there are graph\nfamilies for which such restricted pebblings can be asymptotically better than\nblack pebblings. This proves that, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, resolution\ncan strictly beat black-only pebbling, and in particular that the space lower\nbounds on pebbling formulas in [Ben-Sasson and Nordstrom 2008] are tight.\nSecond, we present a versatile parametrized graph family with essentially the\nsame properties for black and black-white pebbling, which gives sharp\nsimultaneous trade-offs for black and black-white pebbling for various\nparameter settings.

In\nquantum fields, observables restricted to a region of space define a subsystem.\nWhile there are proofs on the existence of local observables that would allow a\nviolation of Bell's inequalities in the vacuum states of quantum fields as well\nas some explicit but technically demanding schemes requiring an extreme\nfine-tuning of the interaction between the fields and detectors, an\nexperimentally accessible entanglement witness for quantum fields is still\nmissing. Here we introduce smeared field operators which allow reducing the\nvacuum to a system of two effective bosonic modes. The introduction of such\ncollective observables is motivated by the fact that no physical probe has\naccess to fields in single spatial (mathematical) points but rather smeared\nover finite volumes. We first give explicit collective observables whose\ncorrelations reveal vacuum entanglement in the Klein-Gordon field. We then show\nthat the critical distance between the two regions of space above which two\neffective bosonic modes become separable is of the order of the Compton\nwavelength of the particle corresponding to the massive Klein-Gordon field.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 11 figures"]}]

To design a memetic algorithm one needs to make a host\nof decisions; selecting a population size is one of the most important among\nthem. Most algorithms in the literature fix the population size to a certain\nconstant value. This reduces the algorithm's quality since the optimal\npopulation size varies for different instances, local search procedures and\nrunning times. In this paper we propose an adjustable population size. It is\ncalculated as a function of the running time of the whole algorithm and the\naverage running time of the local search for the given instance. Note that in\nmany applications the running time of a heuristic should be limited and\ntherefore we use this limit as a parameter of the algorithm. The average\nrunning time of the local search procedure is obtained during the algorithm's\nrun. Some coefficients which are independent with respect to the instance or\nthe local search are to be tuned before the algorithm run; we provide a\nprocedure to find these coefficients. The proposed approach was used to develop\na memetic algorithm for the Multidimensional Assignment Problem (MAP or s-AP in\nthe case of s dimensions) which is an extension of the well-known assignment\nproblem. MAP is NP-hard and has a host of applications. We show that using\nadjustable population size makes the algorithm flexible to perform well for\ninstances of very different sizes and types and for different running times and\nlocal searches. This allows us to select the most efficient local search for\nevery instance type. The results of computational experiments for several\ninstance families and sizes prove that the proposed algorithm performs\nefficiently for a wide range of the running times and clearly outperforms the\nstate-of-the art 3-AP memetic algorithm being given the same time.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

Three major findings are\nyielded. First of all, the electric field is found to modulate the de Haas-van\nAlphen magnetization and magnetic susceptibility through the dimensionless\nparameter $(\\beta =\\frac{E}{\\upsilon_{F}B})$. As the parameter $\\beta$\nincreases, the values of magnetization and magnetic susceptibility increase to\npositive infinity or decrease to negative infinity at the exotic point\n$\\beta_{c}=1$. Besides, the $dHvA$ oscillation amplitude rises abruptly to\ninfinity for zero temperature at $\\beta_{c}=1$, but eventually collapses at a\nfinite temperature thereby leading to the vanishing of de Haas-van Alphen\neffect. In addition, the magnetic susceptibility depends on the electric and\nmagnetic fields, suggesting that the graphene should be a non-linear magnetic\nmedium in the presence of the external field. These results, which are\ndifferent from those obtained in the standard nonrelativistic 2D electron gas,\nare attributed to its anomalous Landau level spectrum in graphene.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Two types of striped diagonal long-range order (striped\norder I and striped order II) are discussed. A state with type-II striped order\nand superfluidity is found, even without nearest-neighbor repulsion. The\nemergence of such a state is due to the inhomogeneity and the anisotropy of the\nlattice structure. However, neither the translational symmetry nor the symmetry\nbetween sublattices of the original lattice is broken. In this paper, we\nrestrict a 'solid state' of lattice bosons as a diagonal long-range ordered\nstate breaking either the translational symmetry of the original lattice or the\nsymmetry of different sublattices. We thus name such a phase a striped\nsuperfluid phase (SSF). In the presence of a nearest-neighbor repulsion, we\nfind two striped charge density wave phases(SCDW I and II) with boson density\n$\\rho=1/2$ (with striped order I) and $\\rho=2/3$ (with striped order II)\nrespectively, when the hopping amplitude is small compared with the repulsion.\nThe SCDW I state is a solid, in which the translational symmetry of the\noriginal lattice is broken. We observe a rather special first-order phase\ntransition showing an interesting multi-loop hysteresis phenomenon between the\ntwo SCDW phases when the hopping term is small enough. This can be accounted\nfor by the special degeneracy of the ground states near the classical limit.\nThe SSF re-appears outside the two SCDW phases. The transition between the SCDW\nI and SSF phases is first order, while the transition between SCDW II and SSF\nphases is continuous. We find that the superfluid stiffness is anisotropic in\nthe SSF states with and without repulsion. In the SSF with repulsion, the\nsuperfluid stiffness is subject to different types of anisotropy in the region\nnear half filling and above 2/3-filling.\n","Comment: 10 figures"]}]

But both experiments are limited by source\nconfusion in the submillimeter. The high confusion noise in particular\nrestricts the study of the clustering properties of the sources that dominate\nthe cosmic infrared background. At these wavelengths, it is more appropriate to\nconsider the statistics of the unresolved component. In particular, high\nclustering will contribute in excess of Poisson noise in the power spectra of\nCIB anisotropies. These power spectra contain contributions from sources at all\nredshift. We show how the stacking technique can be used to separate the\ndifferent redshift contributions to the power spectra. We use simulations of\nCIB representative of realistic Spitzer, Herschel, Planck, and SCUBA-2\nobservations. We stack the 24um sources in longer wavelengths maps to measure\nmean colors per redshift and flux bins. The information retrieved on the mean\nspectral energy distribution obtained with the stacking technique is then used\nto clean the maps, in particular to remove the contribution of low-redshift\nundetected sources to the anisotropies. Using the stacking, we measure the mean\nflux of populations 4 to 6 times fainter than the total noise at 350um at\nredshifts z=1 and z=2, respectively, and as faint as 6 to 10 times fainter than\nthe total noise at 850um at the same redshifts. In the deep Spitzer fields, the\ndetected 24um sources up to z~2 contribute significantly to the submillimeter\nanisotropies.

The calculations took over 6,000 CPU days in\nIndiana University's supercomputer clusters. We tabulate the resulting EoS at\nover 107,000 grid points in the proton fraction range $Y_P$ = 0 to 0.56. For\nthe temperature range $T$ = 0.16 to 15.8 MeV we cover the density range $n_B$ =\n10$^{-4}$ to 1.6 fm$^{-3}$; and for the higher temperature range $T$ = 15.8 to\n80 MeV we cover the larger density range $n_B$ = 10$^{-8}$ to 1.6 fm$^{-3}$. In\nthe future we plan to study low density, low temperature (T$<$15.8 MeV),\nnuclear matter using a Virial expansion, and we will match the low density and\nhigh density results to generate a complete EoS table for use in astrophysical\nsimulations of supernova and neutron star mergers.\n","Comment: Modified introduction.

Mitola's work in 1992, Software Defined Radios (SDRs) have been\nquite a hot topic in wireless systems research. Though many notable\nachievements were reported in the field, the scarcity of computational power on\ngeneral purpose CPUs has always constrained their wide adoption in production\nenvironments. If conveniently applied within an SDR context, classical concepts\nknown in computer science as space/time tradeoffs can be extremely helpful when\ntrying to mitigate this problem. Inspired by and building on those concepts,\nthis paper presents a novel SDR implementation technique which we call Memory\nAcceleration (MA) that makes extensive use of the memory resources available on\na general purpose computing system, in order to accelerate signal computation.\nMA can provide substantial acceleration factors when applied to conventional\nSDRs without reducing their peculiar flexibility. As a practical proof of this,\nan example of MA applied in the real world to the ETSI DVB-T Viterbi decoder is\nprovided. Actually MA is shown able to provide, when applied to such Viterbi\ndecoder, an acceleration factor of 10.4x, with no impact on error correction\nperformances of the decoder and by making no use of any other typical\nperformance enhancement techniques such as low level (Assembler) programming or\nparallel computation, which though remain compatible with MA. Opportunity for\nextending the MA approach to the entire radio system, thus implementing what we\ncall a Memory-Based Software Defined Radio (MB-SDR) is finally considered and\ndiscussed.\n"]}]

Looking at the structure of this network it is possible to recognize a\nfew overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary\nregulatory functions. Among them a special role is played by the\nmicroRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor\nregulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes.

The comparison with QPP interleavers is made in terms of\nsearch complexity and upper bounds of the bit error rate (BER) and frame error\nrate (FER) for AWGN and for independent fading Rayleigh channels. Cubic\npermutation polynomials leading to better performance than quadratic\npermutation polynomials are found for some lengths.\n","Comment: accepted for publication to Wireless Personal Communications (19\n  pages, 4 figures, 5 tables).

We hypothesize that the interaction between a limit cycle\n(originated by the Notch delayed-negative feedback loop) and a bistable switch\n(originated by the Wnt-Notch positive cross-regulation) is responsible for the\nobserved segmentation patterning. Our results agree with previously unexplained\nexperimental observations and suggest a simple plausible mechanism for\nspatiotemporal control of somitogenesis in amniotes.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures, added references, added figures, extended\n  supporting material, revised arguments in the discussion, corrected typos"]}]

Even at moderately large sample sizes, the sample mean exhibits a\nheavy right tail. The standard Normal approximation often does not provide\nadequate inferences about the data's mean in this setting. In previous work, we\nhave examined alternative methods of generating confidence intervals for the\nexpected value. These methods were based upon Gamma and Chi Square\napproximations or tail probability bounds such as Bernstein's Inequality. We\nnow propose growth estimators of the Negative Binomial mean.

A growth\nestimator constructs a Normal-style confidence interval by effectively removing\na small, pre--determined number of zeros from the data.

We show\nthat only the electromagnetic R- and L- waves, those derived from them and the\nO-mode are affected by thermal anisotropies, since they satisfy the required\ncondition B1\\perpB0. By contrast, the perpendicularly propagating X-mode and\nthe modes derived from it (the pure transverse X-mode and Bernstein mode) show\nno such effect. In general, we note that the thermal anisotropy modifies the\nparallel propagating modes via the parallel acoustic effect, while it modifies\nthe perpendicular propagating modes via the Larmor-radius effect. In oblique\npropagation for kinetic Alfven waves, the thermal anisotropy affects the\nkinetic regime more than it affects the inertial regime. The generalized fast\nmode exhibits two distinct acoustic effects, one in the direction parallel to\nthe ambient magnetic field and the other in the direction perpendicular to it.\nIn the fast-mode instability, the magneto-sonic wave causes suppression of the\nfirehose instability. We discuss all these propagation characteristics and\npresent graphic illustrations.\n"]}]

Theoretical studies carried on for over a decade yielded novel\nPM designs that make possible lowering thresholds of semiconductor microlasers,\nproducing directional light emission, achieving optically-induced transparency,\nand enhancing sensitivity of microcavity-based bio-, stress- and\nrotation-sensors.

Filament materials are\nobserved to frequently eject horizontally from the active region part to the\nquiet Sun part. This ejection results in the formation of a dense-column\nstructure (concentration of dark vertical threads) near the border between the\nactive region and the quiet Sun. Using the flux rope insertion method, we\ncreate non-linear force-free field models based on SDO/HMI line-of-sight\nmagnetograms. A key feature of these models is that the flux rope has\nconnections with the surroundings photosphere, so its axial flux varies along\nthe filament path.

Comparison between\nmodel and observations suggests that the bright features on the northern side\nof the channel are the lower legs of the field lines that turn into the flux\nrope.

Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming\nin response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the\nfunctional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey\ndensity increases.

New optimized indices are defined and their equivalent\nwidths (EWs) are measured. A number of sensitive features to the effective\ntemperature and surface gravity are re-identified or newly identified clearly\nshowing the reliability of the sensitivity map analysis. The sensitivity map\nallows to identify the best bandpass limits for the line and nearby continuum.\nIt reliably predicts the trends of spectral features with respect to a given\nphysical parameter but not their absolute strengths. Line blends are easy to\nrecognize when blended features have different behavior with respect to some\nphysical stellar parameter. The use of sensitivity map is therefore\ncomplementary to the use of indices. We give the EWs of the new indices\nmeasured for the IRTF star sample. This new and homogeneous set of EWs will be\nuseful for stellar population synthesis models and can be used to get\nelement-by-element abundances for unresolved stellar population studies in\ngalaxies.\n","Comment: 46 pages, 27 figures, accepted for publication on Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

In this paper, we explore whether the\nedge-ES correspondence extends to nonchiral topological phases. Specifically,\nwe consider the Wen-plaquette model which has Z_2 topological order. The\nunperturbed model displays an exact correspondence: both the edge and\nentanglement spectra within each topological sector a (a = 1,...,4) are flat\nand equally degenerate. Here, we show, through a detailed microscopic\ncalculation, that in the presence of generic local perturbations: (i) the\neffective degrees of freedom for both the physical edge and the entanglement\ncut consist of a spin-1/2 chain, with effective Hamiltonians H_edge^a and\nH_ent.^a, respectively, both of which have a Z_2 symmetry enforced by the bulk\ntopological order; (ii) there is in general no match between their low energy\nspectra, that is, there is no edge-ES correspondence. However, if supplement\nthe Z_2 topological order with a global symmetry (translational invariance\nalong the edge/cut), i.e. by considering the Wen-plaquette model as a symmetry\nenriched topological phase (SET), then there is a finite domain in Hamiltonian\nspace in which both H_edge^a and H_ent.^a realize the critical Ising model,\nwhose low-energy effective theory is the c = 1/2 Ising CFT. This is achieved\nbecause the presence of the global symmetry implies that both Hamiltonians, in\naddition to being Z_2 symmetric, are Kramers-Wannier self-dual. Thus, the bulk\ntopological order and the global translational symmetry of the Wen-plaquette\nmodel as a SET imply an edge-ES correspondence at least in some finite domain\nin Hamiltonian space.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 5 figures; References added; Paper updated to match\n  published version"]}]

We explore a new technique to constrain the matter power\nspectrum on smaller scales, assuming the dark matter is a Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particle (WIMP) that annihilates at early epochs. Energy released by\ndark matter annihilation can modify the spectrum of CMB temperature\nfluctuations and thus CMB experiments such as Planck have been able to\nconstrain the quantity f <sigma v> /m < 1/88 picobarn c / GeV, where f is the\nfraction of energy absorbed by gas, <sigma v> is the annihilation rate assumed\nconstant, and m is the particle mass. We assume the standard scale-invariant\nprimordial matter power spectrum of P_prim(k) ~ k^{n_s} at large scales k <\nk_p, while we adopt the modified power law of P_prim(k) ~ k_p^{n_s}\n(k/k_p)^{m_s} at small scales. We then aim at deriving constraints on m_s. For\nm_s > n_s, the excess small-scale power results in a much larger number of\nnonlinear small mass halos, particularly at high redshifts. Dark matter\nannihilation in these halos releases sufficient energy to partially ionize the\ngas, and consequently modify the spectrum of CMB fluctuations.

The climatic effects of the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events\nwere felt globally, although the North Atlantic experienced the largest and\nmost abrupt temperature anomalies. Similar but weaker oscillations also took\nplace during the interglacial period. This paper proposes an auto-oscillatory\nmechanism between sea ice and convective deep water formation in the north\nAtlantic as the source of the persistent cycles. A simple dynamical model is\nconstructed by coupling and slightly modifying two existing models of ocean\ncirculation and sea ice. The model exhibits mixed mode oscillations, consisting\nof decadal scale small amplitude oscillations, and a large amplitude relaxation\nfluctuation. The decadal oscillations occur due to the insulating effect of sea\nice and leads to periodic ventilation of heat from the polar ocean. Gradually\nan instability builds up in the polar column and results in an abrupt\ninitiation of convection and polar warming. The unstable convective state\nrelaxes back to the small amplitude oscillations from where the process repeats\nin a self-sustained manner. Freshwater pulses mimicking Heinrich events cause\nthe oscillations to be grouped into packets of progressively weaker\nfluctuations, as also observed in the proxy records. Modulation of this stable\noscillation mechanism by freshwater and insolation variations could account for\nthe distribution and pacing of DO and Bond events.

To\nfurther alleviate the data sparsity issue, Geo-SAGE exploits the geographical\ncorrelation by smoothing the crowd's preferences over a well-designed spatial\nindex structure called spatial pyramid. We conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate the performance of our Geo-SAGE model on two real large-scale\ndatasets.

Helical peptide\nstructures exclude a smaller volume to water, relative to non-helical\nstructures with both the water models, but the total system volume for helical\nconformations is higher than non-helical conformations with TIP3P water at low\nto intermediate pressures, in contrast to TIP4P/2005 water.

In the model fibers break due to two mechanisms: slowly accumulating\ndamage triggers bursts of immediate breakings analogous to acoustic emissions\nin experiments. The rupture process accelerates such that the size of breaking\navalanches increases while the waiting time between consecutive events\ndecreases towards failure. Record events are defined as bursts which have a\nlarger size than all previous events in the time series. We analyze the\nstatistics of records focusing on the limit of equal load sharing (ELS) of the\nmodel and compare the results to the record statistics of sequences of\nindependent identically distributed random variables. Computer simulations\nrevealed that the number of records grows with the logarithm of the event\nnumber except for the close vicinity of macroscopic failure where an\nexponential dependence is evidenced. The two regimes can be attributed to the\ndominance of disorder with small burst sizes and to stress enhancements giving\nrise efficient triggering of extended bursts, respectively. Both the size of\nrecords and the increments between consecutive record events are characterized\nby power law distributions with a common exponent 1.33 significantly different\nfrom the usual ELS burst size exponents of fiber bundles. The distribution of\nwaiting times follows the same behavior, however, with two distinct exponents\nfor low and high loads.

A physical mimic of the process using a layered swelling gel\ncaptures the essence of the mechanism, and numerical simulations of the brain\ntreated as a soft solid lead to the formation of cusped sulci and smooth gyri\nsimilar to those in the brain. The resulting gyrification patterns are a\nfunction of relative cortical expansion and relative thickness (compared with\nbrain size), and are consistent with observations of a wide range of brains,\nranging from smooth to highly convoluted. Furthermore, this dependence on two\nsimple geometric parameters that characterize the brain also allows us to\nqualitatively explain how variations in these parameters lead to anatomical\nanomalies in such situations as polymicrogyria, pachygyria, and lissencephalia.\n"]}]
