These interactions evolve in response to changes in the protein's\nchemical or physical environment (such as the addition of an antibiotic), or\nwhen genes duplicate and diverge. Several recent studies have shown the\nimportance of folding stability in constraining protein evolution. Here we\ninvestigate how structural coupling between protein folding and binding -- the\nfact that most proteins can only bind their targets when folded -- gives rise\nto evolutionary coupling between the traits of folding stability and binding\nstrength. Using biophysical and evolutionary modeling, we show how these\nprotein traits can emerge as evolutionary \"spandrels\" even if they do not\nconfer an intrinsic fitness advantage. In particular, proteins can evolve\nstrong binding interactions that have no functional role but merely serve to\nstabilize the protein if misfolding is deleterious. Furthermore, such proteins\nmay have divergent fates, evolving to bind or not bind their targets depending\non random mutation events. These observations may explain the abundance of\napparently nonfunctional interactions among proteins observed in\nhigh-throughput assays. In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding\nand deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of\nbiophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra\nfolding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is\ndeveloped. These findings have important consequences for our understanding of\nfundamental evolutionary principles of both natural and engineered proteins.\n"]}]

I begin to consider the secular changes induced in galactic\nsystems by such presumed variations, assumed adiabatic. It is important to\nunderstand these effects, in isolation from other evolutionary influences, in\norder to identify or constrain a0 variations by detection of induced effects,\nor lack thereof. I find that as long as the system is fully in the deep-MOND\nregime -- as applies to many galactic systems -- the adiabatic response of the\nsystem obeys simple scaling laws. For example, in a system that would be\nstationary for fixed a0, the system expands homologously as a0^{-1/4}, while\ninternal velocities decrease uniformly as a0^{1/4}. If a0 is proportional to cH\nat all relevant times, this change amounts to a factor of ~ 2.5 since redshift\n10. For a system stationary in a rotating frame, the angular frequency\ndecreases as a0^{1/2}. The accelerations increase relative to a0 as a0^{-1/4},\npushing the system towards the Newtonian regime. All this follows from the\nappearance of a0 in MOND and the scale invariance of the deep-MOND limit -- two\nbasic tenets of MOND. More complicated evolution ensues when parts of the\nsystem become Newtonian, or are so from inception. For example, these parts may\nbecome unstable, not being protected by MOND's stabilizing effects.

There are $n$ sites (or loci), a finite number of letters (or\nalleles) at every site, and we do not make any scaling assumptions. In\nparticular, we do not assume a diffusion limit. We consider the following\nmarginal ancestral recombination process. Let $S = \\{1,...c,n\\}$ and $\\mathcal\nA=\\{A_1, ...c, A_m\\}$ be a partition of $S$. We concentrate on the joint\nprobability of the letters at the sites in $A_1$ in individual $1$, $...c$, at\nthe sites in $A_m$ in individual $m$, where the individuals are sampled from\nthe current population without replacement. Following the ancestry of these\nsites backwards in time yields a process on the set of partitions of $S$,\nwhich, in the diffusion limit, turns into a marginalised version of the\n$n$-locus ancestral recombination graph. With the help of an\ninclusion-exclusion principle, we show that the type distribution corresponding\nto a given partition may be represented in a systematic way, with the help of\nso-called recombinators and sampling functions. The same is true of correlation\nfunctions (known as linkage disequilibria in genetics) of all orders.\n  We prove that the partitioning process (backward in time) is dual to the\nMoran population process (forward in time), where the sampling function plays\nthe role of the duality function. This sheds new light on the work of\nBobrowski, Wojdyla, and Kimmel (2010). The result also leads to a closed system\nof ordinary differential equations for the expectations of the sampling\nfunctions, which can be translated into expected type distributions and\nexpected linkage disequilibria.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 6 figures"]}]

With ASDEX-Upgrade as an\nexample, it is shown how the attempt to conduct vacuum suitable welding has\ndecreased the fatigue strength. ITER could repeat the mistakes of ASDEX-Upgrade\neven for unwanted welding (accidental fusing of joints).\n","Comment: 5 pages,5 figures"]}]

In this paper we find the characteristic equation\nof states possessing similar properties for a bipartite systems governed by a\nlinear dynamical equation whose generator is sum of a free term and an\ninteraction term. In particular in the case of a small system coupled to its\nenvironment, we deduce the characteristic equation of decoherence free states\nnamely mixed states evolving as if the interaction term were effectively\ninactive. Several examples illustrate the applicability of our theory in\ndifferent physical contexts.\n","Comment: Dedicated to Margarita and Volodia Man'ko for their 150th birthday"]}]
