It has been proved recently that the Rips complex\ncaptures the homotopy type of the shape assuming the vertices of the complex\nmeet some mild sampling conditions. Unfortunately, the Rips complex is\ngenerally high-dimensional. To remedy this problem, it is tempting to simplify\nit through a sequence of collapses.

Experiments suggest that, as we simplify the\ncomplex by iteratively collapsing faces, it should indeed be possible to avoid\nentering a dead end such as the famous Bing's house with two rooms. This paper\nprovides a theoretical justification for this empirical observation.\n  We demonstrate that the Rips complex of a point-cloud (for a well-chosen\nscale parameter) can always be turned into a simplicial complex homeomorphic to\nthe shape by a sequence of collapses, assuming the shape is nicely triangulable\nand well-sampled (two concepts we will explain in the paper).

Second, we perform the analysis\nwith the copula likelihood, a technique which makes a weaker assumption\ncompared to the Gaussian likelihood. Third, direct, non-analytic parameter\nestimations are applied using the full information of the distribution. Fourth,\nwe obtain constraints with approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an\nefficient, robust, and likelihood-free algorithm based on accept-reject\nsampling. We find that neglecting the CDC effect enlarges parameter contours by\n22%, and that the covariance-varying copula likelihood is a very good\napproximation to the true likelihood. The direct techniques work well in spite\nof noisier contours. Concerning ABC, the iterative process converges quickly to\na posterior distribution that is in an excellent agreement with results from\nour other analyses. The time cost for ABC is reduced by two orders of\nmagnitude. The stochastic nature of our weak-lensing peak count model allows us\nto use various techniques that approach the true underlying probability\ndistribution of observables, without making simplifying assumptions.

These motors generate sliding forces between adjacent\nmicrotubule doublets within the axoneme, the motile cytoskeletal structure\ninside the flagellum. To create regular, oscillatory beating patterns, the\nactivities of the axonemal dyneins must be coordinated both spatially and\ntemporally. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses or strains\nthat build up within the moving axoneme, but it is not known which components\nof stress or strain are involved, nor how they feed back on the dyneins. To\nanswer this question, we used isolated, reactivate axonemes of the unicellular\nalga Chlamydomonas as a model system. We derived a theory for beat regulation\nin a two-dimensional model of the axoneme. We then tested the theory by\nmeasuring the beat waveforms of wild type axonemes, which have asymmetric\nbeats, and mutant axonemes, in which the beat is nearly symmetric, using\nhigh-precision spatial and temporal imaging. We found that regulation by\nsliding forces fails to account for the measured beat, due to the short lengths\nof Chlamydomonas cilia. We found that regulation by normal forces (which tend\nto separate adjacent doublets) cannot satisfactorily account for the symmetric\nwaveforms of the mbo2 mutants. This is due to the model's failure to produce\nreciprocal inhibition across the axes of the symmetrically beating axonemes.\nFinally, we show that regulation by curvature accords with the measurements.\nUnexpectedly, we found that the phase of the curvature feedback indicates that\nthe dyneins are regulated by the dynamic (i.e. time-varying) component of\naxonemal curvature, but not by the static one. We conclude that a high-pass\nfiltered curvature signal is a good candidate for the signal that feeds back to\ncoordinate motor activity in the axoneme.\n"]}]

This paper presents an approach to drainage direction\nassignment which is not restricted by a flat's shape, number of outlets, or\nsurrounding topography. Flow is modeled by superimposing a gradient away from\nhigher terrain with a gradient towards lower terrain resulting in a drainage\nfield exhibiting flow convergence, an improvement over methods which produce\nregions of parallel flow. This approach builds on previous work by Garbrecht\nand Martz (1997), but presents several important improvements. The improved\nalgorithm guarantees that flats are only resolved if they have outlets. The\nalgorithm does not require iterative application; a single pass is sufficient\nto resolve all flats. The algorithm presents a clear strategy for identifying\nflats and their boundaries. The algorithm is not susceptible to loss of\nfloating-point precision. Furthermore, the algorithm is efficient, operating in\nO( N ) time whereas the older algorithm operates in O( N^(3/2) ) time. In\ntesting, the improved algorithm ran 6.5 times faster than the old for a 100 x\n100 cell flat and 69 times faster for a 700 x 700 cell flat. In tests on actual\nDEMs, the improved algorithm finished its processing 38--110 times sooner while\nrunning on a single processor than a parallel implementation of the old\nalgorithm did while running on 16 processors.
