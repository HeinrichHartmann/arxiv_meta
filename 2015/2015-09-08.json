Infinite constellations are the framework, proposed by Poltyrev, for\nanalyzing coded modulation codes. The Poltyrev's capacity, is the highest\nachievable normalized log density (NLD) of codewords per unit volume, at\npossibly large block length, that guarantees a vanishing error probability. For\na given finite block length and a fixed error probability, there is a gap\nbetween the highest achievable NLD and Poltyrev's capacity. The dispersion\nanalysis quantifies asymptotically this gap.\n  The thesis begins by the dispersion analysis of infinite constellations in\nscalar fading channels. Later on, we extend the analysis to the case of\nmultiple input multiple output fading channels. As in other channels, we show\nthat the gap between the highest achievable NLD and the Poltyrev's capacity,\nvanishes asymptotically as the square root of the channel dispersion over the\nblock length, multiplied by the inverse Q-function of the allowed error\nprobability.\n  Moreover, exact terms for Poltyrev's capacity and channel dispersion, are\nderived in the thesis. The relations to the amplitude and to the power\nconstrained fading channels are also discussed, especially in terms of\ncapacity, channel dispersion and error exponents.

Different from the traditional domain adaption methods which rely on a\nglobal domain shift for all classes between source and target domain, the\nproposed method is more flexible to capture individual class variations across\ndomains. By adopting a natural and widely used assumption -- \"the data samples\nfrom the same class should lay on a low-dimensional subspace, even if they come\nfrom different domains\", the proposed method circumvents the limitation of the\nglobal domain shift, and solves the cross-domain recognition by finding the\ncompact joint subspaces of source and target domain. Specifically, given\nlabeled samples in source domain, we construct subspaces for each of the\nclasses. Then we construct subspaces in the target domain, called anchor\nsubspaces, by collecting unlabeled samples that are close to each other and\nhighly likely all fall into the same class. The corresponding class label is\nthen assigned by minimizing a cost function which reflects the overlap and\ntopological structure consistency between subspaces across source and target\ndomains, and within anchor subspaces, respectively.We further combine the\nanchor subspaces to corresponding source subspaces to construct the compact\njoint subspaces. Subsequently, one-vs-rest SVM classifiers are trained in the\ncompact joint subspaces and applied to unlabeled data in the target domain. We\nevaluate the proposed method on two widely used datasets: object recognition\ndataset for computer vision tasks, and sentiment classification dataset for\nnatural language processing tasks.

The Level-B Analysis has a better sensitivity (not\nbe worse than the final one by a factor of 2) and the results should be\navailable within 10 hours from the acquisition of the data: for this reason\nthis analysis could be performed at the end of an observation or next morning.\nThe latency (in particular for the RTA) and the sensitivity requirements are\nchallenging because of the large data rate, a few GByte/s. The remote\nconnection to the CTA candidate site with a rather limited network bandwidth\nmakes the issue of the exported data size extremely critical and prevents any\nkind of processing in real-time of the data outside the site of the telescopes.\nFor these reasons the analysis will be performed on-site with infrastructures\nco-located with the telescopes, with limited electrical power availability and\nwith a reduced possibility of human intervention. This means, for example, that\nthe on-site hardware infrastructure should have low-power consumption. A\nsubstantial effort towards the optimization of high-throughput computing\nservice is envisioned to provide hardware and software solutions with\nhigh-throughput, low-power consumption at a low-cost.\n","Comment: In Proceedings of the 34th International Cosmic Ray Conference\n  (ICRC2015), The Hague, The Netherlands.

Hybrid-BCP is backward-compatible with the CAN bus\ntechnology, and builds on the BCP protocol, designed for wireless sensor\nnetworks. Hybrid-BCP achieves high throughput and shows resilience to dynamic\nnetwork conditions, including adversarial interferences. Our testbed\nimplementation, based on CAN and ZigBee transceivers, demonstrates the load\nbalancing and routing functionalities of Hybrid-BCP and its resilience to DoS\nattacks. We further provide simulation results, obtained with the ns-3\nsimulator and based on real intra-car RSSI traces, that compare between the\nperformance of Hybrid-BCP and a tree-based collection protocol. Notably, the\nsimulations show that Hybrid-BCP can achieve the same performance as the\ntree-based protocol while reducing the radio transmission power by a factor of\n10.\n"]}]

In the case of terrestrial robots, one of\nthe available options is the GNBot, an open-hardware project intended for the\nevaluation of swarm search strategies. The lack of basic odometry sensors such\nas wheel encoders had so far difficulted the implementation of an accurate\nhigh-level controller in this platform. Thus, the aim of this thesis is to\nimprove motion control in the GNBot by incorporating a gyroscope whilst\nmaintaining the requisite of no wheel encoders. Among the problems that have\nbeen tackled are: accurate in-place rotations, minimal drift during linear\nmotions, and arc-performing functionality. Additionally, the resulting\ncontroller is calibrated autonomously by using both the gyroscope module and\nthe infrared rangefinder on board each robot, greatly simplifying the\ncalibration of large swarms. The report first explains the design decisions\nthat were made in order to implement the self-calibration routine, and then\nevaluates the performance of the new motion controller by means of off-line\nvideo tracking. The motion accuracy of the new controller is also compared with\nthe previously existing solution in an odor search experiment.\n","Comment: MSc thesis supervised by Prof. Andrew J.
