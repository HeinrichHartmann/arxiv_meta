The task is complicated by the nonlinear biasing and redshift space\ndistortion effects, which change with halo mass, and by the wide distribution\nof halo masses and their occupations by galaxies. One of the main modeling\nchallenges is the existence of satellite galaxies that have both radial\ndistribution and large virial velocities inside halos, a phenomenon known as\nthe Finger-of-God effect. We present a model for the galaxy power spectrum of\nin which we decompose a given galaxy sample into central and satellite galaxies\nand relate different contributions to 1- and 2-halo terms in a halo model. Our\nprimary goal is to ensure that any parameters that we introduce have physically\nmeaningful values, and are not just fitting parameters. For the 2-halo terms we\nuse the previously developed RSD modeling of halos in the context of\ndistribution function and perturbation theory approach. This term needs to be\nmultiplied by the effect of radial distances and velocities of satellites\ninside the halo. To this one needs to add the 1-halo terms, which are\nnon-perturbative. We show that the real space 1-halo terms can be modeled as\nalmost constant, with the finite extent of the satellites inside the halo\ninducing a small k^2R^2 term, where R is related to the size of the halo. We\nadopt a similar model for FoG in redshift space, ensuring that FoG velocity\ndispersion is related to the halo mass. For FoG k^2 type expansions do not work\nand FoG resummation must be used instead. We test several damping functions to\nmodel the velocity dispersion FoG effect. Applying the formalism to mock\ngalaxies modeled after the \"CMASS\" sample of the BOSS survey, we find that our\npredictions for the redshift-space power spectra are accurate up to k~0.4Mpc/h.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, minor changes made with respect to\n  published version"]}]

This model integrates a number of system\ndecisions in both the planning and operational stages, including facility\nlocation, multi-level service assignments, multi-modal transportation\nconfiguration, and inventory management. In particular, we consider\nprobabilistic supplier disruptions that may halt product supply from certain\nsuppliers from time to time. To mitigate the impact from supplier disruptions,\na terminal facility may be assigned to multiple supplies that back up each\nother with different service priorities. With such multi-level service\nassignments, even when some suppliers are disrupted, a facility may still be\nsupplied by the remaining functioning suppliers. Expensive expedited shipments\nyet with assured fast delivery may be used in complement to less expensive\nregular shipments yet with uncertain long lead times.
