In the noninteracting\nlimit, this exotic state has been intensively studied and explored with\nrealistic systems, such as HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells.

In this review, we develop an analytical\napproach based on a combined perturbative and self-consistent mean-field\ntreatment of interactions that is capable of capturing topological phase\ntransitions beyond either method when used independently. As an illustration of\nthe method, we study the effects of short-ranged interactions on the $Z_2$\ntopological insulator phase, also known as the quantum spin Hall phase, in\nthree generalized versions of the Kane-Mele model at half-filling on the\nhoneycomb lattice.

A discrete-time channel\nmodel that takes into account the effect of filtering on the phase noise is\ndeveloped. The model is based on a multi-sample receiver, i.e., an\nintegrate-and-dump filter whose output is sampled at a rate higher than the\nsignaling rate. It is shown that, at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nmulti-sample receiver achieves a rate that grows logarithmically with the SNR\nif the number of samples per symbol (oversampling factor) grows with the cubic\nroot of the SNR. Moreover, the pre-log factor is at least 1/2 and can be\nachieved by amplitude modulation. Numerical simulations are used to compute\nlower bounds on the information rates achieved by the multi-sample receiver.\nThe simulations show that oversampling is beneficial for both strong and weak\nphase noise at high SNR. In fact, the information rates are sometimes\nsubstantially larger than when using commonly-used approximate discrete-time\nmodels. Finally, for an approximate discrete-time model of the multi-sample\nreceiver, the capacity pre-log at high SNR is at least 3/4 if the number of\nsamples per symbol grows with the square root of the SNR. The analysis shows\nthat phase modulation achieves a pre-log of at least 1/4 while amplitude\nmodulation achieves a pre-log of 1/2.

To bridge the gap\nbetween the real and synthetic data, and jointly learn from synthetic and real\ndata, this paper proposes a Multichannel Autoencoder(MCAE). We show that by\nsuing MCAE, it is possible to learn a better feature representation for\nclassification. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on\ntwo types of datasets. Experimental results on two datasets validate the\nefficiency of our MCAE model and our methodology of generating synthetic data.\n","Comment: 10 pages"]}]

To\nconstruct its TT approximation numerically, we develop the new block TT cross\nalgorithm, a method that computes the whole TT decomposition from a few\nevaluations of the PCE formula. The new method is conceptually similar to the\nadaptive cross approximation in the TT format, but is more efficient when\nseveral tensors must be stored in the same TT representation, which is the case\nfor the PCE. Besides, we demonstrate how to assemble the stochastic Galerkin\nmatrix and to compute the solution of the elliptic equation and its\npost-processing, staying in the TT format.\n  We compare our technique with the traditional sparse polynomial chaos and the\nMonte Carlo approaches. In the tensor product polynomial chaos, the polynomial\ndegree is bounded for each random variable independently. This provides higher\naccuracy than the sparse polynomial set or the Monte Carlo method, but the\ncardinality of the tensor product set grows exponentially with the number of\nrandom variables. However, when the PCE coefficients are implicitly\napproximated in the TT format, the computations with the full tensor product\npolynomial set become possible. In the numerical experiments, we confirm that\nthe new methodology is competitive in a wide range of parameters, especially\nwhere high accuracy and high polynomial degrees are required.\n","Comment: This is a major revision of the manuscript arXiv:1406.2816 with\n  significantly extended numerical experiments.

We also prove a\n\"lifting lemma\" for generic points: given a joining $\\xi$ of two\nshift-invariant measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$, every point $x$ generic for $\\mu$\nlifts to a pair $(x,y)$ generic for $\\xi$ (such $y$ exists in the full symbolic\nspace).

The origin of this fusion hindrance has not been well\nunderstood from a microscopic point of view. Purpose: Analyze the fusion\ndynamics in heavy systems by a microscopic reaction model and understand the\norigin of the fusion hindrance. Method: We employ the time-dependent\nHartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We extract nucleus--nucleus potential and energy\ndissipation by the method combining TDHF dynamics of the entrance channel of\nfusion reactions with one-dimensional Newton equation including a dissipation\nterm. Then, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance using the properties\nof the extracted potential and energy dissipation. Results: Extracted\npotentials show monotonic increase as the relative distance of two nuclei\ndecreases, which induces the disappearance of an ordinary barrier structure of\nthe potential. This is different from those in light- and medium-mass systems\nand from density-constraint TDHF calculations. Extracted friction coefficients\nshow sizable energy dependence and universal value of their magnitude, which\nare rather similar to those in light- and medium-mass systems. Using these\nproperties, we analyze the origin of the fusion hindrance and find that\ncontribution of the increase in potential to the extra-push energy is larger\nthan that of the accumulated dissipation energy in most systems studied in this\narticle. Conclusions: By the analysis of the origin of the fusion hindrance, we\nconclude that, as the system becomes heavier, the dynamical increase in\npotential at small relative distances plays a more important role than the\ndissipation during the fusion reaction for understanding the origin of the\nfusion hindrance.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 18 figures"]}]

This paper shows some\nproperties of matrices in order to facilitate the understanding and locating\nsymmetrizable matrices with specific characteristics, called positive\nquasi-Cartan companion matrices. Here, symmetrizable matrix are those which are\nsymmetric when multiplied by a diagonal matrix with positive entries called\nsymmetrizer matrix. Four algorithms are developed: one to decide whether there\nis a symmetrizer matrix; second to find such symmetrizer matrix; another to\ndecide whether the matrix is positive or not; and the last to find a positive\nquasi-Cartan companion matrix, if there exists. The third algorithm is used to\nprove that the problem to decide if a matrix has a positive quasi-Cartan\ncompanion is NP.\n","Comment: 10 pages, submitted to International Journal of Applied Mathmatics\n  (IJAM)"]}]
