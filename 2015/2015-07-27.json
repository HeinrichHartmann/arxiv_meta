Our method generalizes a previous construction of Bernardi by loosening\nits conditions of applications so as to include annular maps, that is maps\nembedded in the plane with a root face different from the outer face.\n  The bijective construction presented here relies deeply on the theory of\n\\alpha-orientations introduced by Felsner, and in particular on the existence\nof minimal and accessible orientations. Since most of the families of maps can\nbe characterized by such orientations, our generic bijective method is proved\nto capture as special cases all previously known bijections involving\nblossoming trees: for example Eulerian maps, m-Eulerian maps, non separable\nmaps and simple triangulations and quadrangulations of a k-gon. Moreover, it\nalso permits to obtain new bijective constructions for bipolar orientations and\nd-angulations of girth d of a k-gon.\n  As for applications, each specialization of the construction translates into\nenumerative by-products, either via a closed formula or via a recursive\ncomputational scheme. Besides, for every family of maps described in the paper,\nthe construction can be implemented in linear time. It yields thus an effective\nway to encode and generate planar maps.\n  In a recent work, Bernardi and Fusy introduced another unified bijective\nscheme, we adopt here a different strategy which allows us to capture different\nbijections.

Two competing approaches have\nbeen the clonal selection theory and the idiotypic-network theory, each\nstemming from a relatively separate set of principles. One recent perspective\nholding the promise of unification is that of immunity as computation, that is,\nof immunity as the process of computing the state of the body so that\nprotection can be effected, as well as boosted through learning. Here we\ninvestigate the use of cellular automata (CA) as the core abstraction\nsupporting this new perspective. Our choice of CA for this role is based on the\npotential variety of basins in a CA attractor field. Associating each basin\nwith a consistent set of body states, and moreover providing for the noisy\nevolution of the CA in time so that jumping between basins is possible, have\nprovided the necessary backdrop. Given a CA rule to be followed by all cells\nsynchronously, our model is based on a probability with which each cell, at\neach time step, independently updates its own state differently than the rule\nmandates. Setting up and solving the corresponding Markov chain for its\nstationary probabilities have revealed that already in the context of\nelementary CA there exist rules that, while allowing transitions between\nbasins, display remarkable resiliency in terms of basin occupation. For these\nrules, the long-run probability that the CA is found in a given basin is\npractically the same as in the deterministic case when the initial CA state is\nchosen uniformly at random.

Its input\nconsists of a set system F over a finite universe U and an integer t; the\nquestion is whether there is a set of t elements that intersects every set in\nF. The Hitting Set problem parameterized by the size of the solution is a\nwell-known W[2]-complete problem in parameterized complexity theory. In this\npaper we investigate the complexity of Hitting Set under various structural\nparameterizations of the input. Our starting point is the folklore result that\nHitting Set is polynomial-time solvable if there is a tree T on vertex set U\nsuch that the sets in F induce connected subtrees of T. We consider the case\nthat there is a treelike graph with vertex set U such that the sets in F induce\nconnected subgraphs; the parameter of the problem is a measure of how treelike\nthe graph is.

Use of what we call the relational $N$-body\nproblem as a model indicates the need to employ two distinct entropy-type\nconcepts to describe the universe. One, which we call entaxy, is novel. It is\nscale-invariant and decreases as the observable universe evolves. The other is\nthe algebraic sum of the dimensionful entropies of branch systems (isolated\nsubsystems of the universe). This conventional additive entropy increases. In\nour model, the decrease of entaxy is fundamental and makes possible the\nemergence of branch systems and their increasing entropy. We have previously\nshown that all solutions of our model divide into two halves at a unique `Janus\npoint' of maximum disorder. This constitutes a common past for two futures each\nwith its own gravitational arrow of time. We now show that these arrows are\nexpressed through the formation of branch systems within which conventional\nentropy increases. On either side of the Janus point, this increase is in the\nsame direction in every branch system. We also show that it is only possible to\nspecify unbiased solution-determining data at the Janus point. Special\nproperties of these `mid-point data' make it possible to develop a rational\ntheory of the typicality of universes whose governing law, as in our model,\ndictates the presence of a Janus point in every solution.

Most previous work on gravitational billiards has been\nconcerned with two dimensional boundaries. In particular the case of linear\nboundaries, also known as the wedge billiard, has been widely studied. In this\nwork, we introduce a three dimensional version of the wedge; that is, we study\nthe nonlinear dynamics of a billiard in a constant gravitational field\ncolliding elastically with a linear cone of half angle $\\theta$. We derive a\ntwo-dimensional Poincar\\'{e} map with two parameters, the half angle of the\ncone and $\\ell$, the $z$-component of the billiard's angular momentum. Although\nthis map is sufficient to determine the future motion of the billiard, the\nthree-dimensional nature of the physical trajectory means that a periodic orbit\nof the mapping does not always correspond to a periodic trajectory in\ncoordinate space. We demonstrate several integrable cases of the parameter\nvalues, and analytically compute the system's fixed point, analyzing the\nstability of this orbit as a function of the parameters as well as its relation\nto the physical trajectory of the billiard. Next, we explore the phase space of\nthe system numerically. We find that for small values of $\\ell$ the conic\nbilliard exhibits behavior characteristic of two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian\nsystems with a discontinuity, and the dynamics is qualitatively similar to that\nof the wedge billiard, although the correspondence is not exact.

A recent\nsimulation study revealed that active rotation can induce phase separation in\nmixtures of counter-rotating particles in 2D. In contrast to that of linearly\nself-propelled particles, the phase separation of counter-rotating fluids is\naccompanied by steady convective flows that originate at the fluid-fluid\ninterface.

The effect of\nactive rotation is introduced though an additional force within the\nNavier-Stokes equations that arises due to gradients in the concentrations of\nclockwise and counter-clockwise rotating particles. Depending on the strength\nof active rotation and that of frictional interactions with the stationary\nsurroundings, we observe and explain new dynamical behaviors such as \"active\ncoarsening\" via self-generated flows as well as the emergence of self-propelled\nvortex doublets.

Diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI),\nrecently considered to be one sensitive biomarker, is an extension of diffusion\ntensor imaging, which quantifies the degree of non-Gaussianity of the\ndiffusion. This work proposes an efficient scheme of maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE) in DKI: we start from the Rician noise model of the signal\nintensities.

To guarantee the physical relevance of\nthe diffusion kurtosis we apply the ternary quartic (TQ) parametrization to\nutilize its positivity, which imposes the upper bound to the kurtosis. A\nFisher-scoring method is used for achieving fast convergence of the individual\ndiffusion compartments. In addition, we use the barrier method to constrain the\nlower bound to the kurtosis.

Organizations\ntrying to incorporate the concept of software product line to reduce\ndevelopment time and cost require certain rules to be followed for successful\ndevelopment and management, they also require a direct procedure to evaluate\nthe current maturity level of the process. In this work certain rules for\ndeveloping and managing a software product line are put forward.

Four\ncase studies were conducted to validate the framework, and results show that\nSPLPAT provides a direct mechanism to evaluate current software product line\nprocess maturity level within an organization. The results of the developed\nsoftware product line process assessment approach were compared with the\nexisting CMM-level of the organization in order to evaluate the reliability of\nthe presented approach and to find out how effectively an organization can\nexecute software product line process when it has already achieved a certain\nCMM level.\n"]}]
