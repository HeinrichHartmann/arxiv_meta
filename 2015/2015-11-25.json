The Continuous Spontaneous\nLocalization (CSL) approach to quantum mechanics attempts to solve the quantum\nmeasurement question in a general context. In this framework, the wavefunction\ncollapse is caused by adding new non linear and stochastic terms to the\nSchroedinger equation. In this paper, we apply this theory to inflation, which\namounts to solving the CSL parametric oscillator case. We choose the\nwavefunction collapse to occur on an eigenstate of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable\nand discuss the corresponding modified Schroedinger equation. Then, we compute\nthe power spectrum of the perturbations and show that it acquires a universal\nshape with two branches, one which remains scale invariant and one with nS=4, a\nspectral index in obvious contradiction with the Cosmic Microwave Background\n(CMB) anisotropy observations. The requirement that the non-scale invariant\npart be outside the observational window puts stringent constraints on the\nparameter controlling the deviations from ordinary quantum mechanics...\n(Abridged).\n","Comment: References added, minor corrections, conclusions unchanged"]}]

Investigations of a broad parameter space indicate\nthat: accretion of Earth was heterogeneous, metal-silicate equilibration\npressures increase as accretion progresses and are 60-70% of core-mantle\nboundary pressures at the time of each impact, and a large fraction (70-100%)\nof the metal of impactor cores equilibrates with a small fraction of the\nsilicate mantles of protoplanets during each core formation event. Acceptable\nfits to the Earth's mantle composition are obtained only when bodies that\noriginated close to the Sun, at <0.9-1.2 AU, are highly reduced and those\nbeyond this distance are increasingly oxidized. The FeO content of the Martian\nmantle depends critically on the heliocentric distance at which the\nMars-forming embryo originated. Finally, the Earth's core is predicted to\ncontain 8-9 wt% silicon, 2-4 wt% oxygen and 10-60 ppm hydrogen, whereas the\nMartian core is predicted to contain low concentrations (<1 wt%) of Si and O.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ICARUS on Oct 9, 2014"]}]

We show that the slope of the total density\nprofile gamma_tot within the effective radius depends on the stellar surface\ndensity, as demonstrated previously, but also on the halo mass. We analyze\nthese trends using halo occupation models and resolved stellar kinematics with\nthe goal of testing the universality of the DM profile.

We\nconsider a fullduplex H-AP which simultaneously transmits energy signals and\nreceives information signals. In this scenario, we address a joint subcarrier\nscheduling and power allocation problem to maximize the sum-rate under two\ncases: perfect self-interference cancelation (SIC) where the H-AP fully\neliminates its self interference (SI) and imperfect SIC where the residual SI\nexist. In general, the problems for both cases are non-convex due to the\nsubcarrier scheduling, and thus it requires an exhaustive search method, which\nis prohibitively complicated to obtain the globally optimal solution. In order\nto reduce the complexity, for the perfect SIC scenario, we jointly optimize\nsubcarrier scheduling and power allocation by applying the Lagrange duality\nmethod. Next, for the imperfect SIC case, the problem is more complicated due\nto the SI at the H-AP. To solve the problem, we propose an iterative algorithm\nbased on the projected gradient method. Simulation results show that the\nproposed algorithm for the case of perfect SIC exhibits only negligible\nsum-rate performance loss compared to the optimal algorithm, and the proposed\niterative algorithm for the imperfect SIC case offers a significant performance\ngain over conventional schemes.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign\n  error in equation 1"]}]

We show that approaches which include careful data\npreparation and model design offer a significant improvement in comparison with\nseveral competing machine learning algorithms.

However, practical applications of UCNCs are hindered\nby their low upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) and the high irradiances\nnecessary to produce relevant upconversion luminescence. Achieving high UCQY\nunder practically relevant irradiance remains a major challenge. The UCQY is\nseverely limited due to non-radiative surface quenching processes. We present a\nrate equation model for migration of the excitation energy to show that surface\nquenching does not only affect the lanthanide ions directly at the surface but\nalso many other lanthanide ions quite far away from the surface. The average\nmigration path length is in the order of several nanometers and depends on the\ndoping as well as the irradiance of the excitation.

Complex, multi-factorial models are commonly used to study\nmorphogenesis.

In this paper, we introduce a\nworkflow for a global sensitivity analysis approach to study the impact of\nsingle parameters and the interactions between them on the output of\nmorphogenesis models. To demonstrate the workflow, we used a published,\nwell-studied model of vascular morphogenesis.

The global sensitivity analysis correctly identified the dominant\nparameters in the model, consistent with previous studies.

The uncertainty in the output of the model was\nlargely caused by single parameters. The parameter interactions, although of\nlow impact, provided new insights in the mechanisms of \\emph{in silico}\nsprouting. Finally, the analysis indicated that the model could be reduced by\none parameter. We propose global sensitivity analysis as an alternative\napproach to study and validate the mechanisms of morphogenesis.

Despite the importance of this\nparameter, it has been difficult to make an accurate experimental measurement,\nmostly because of the difficulty of determining the absolute densities of\npolaritons and bare excitons.

This means that for every photon-driven body force,\nthere should be a sublimation-driven analogue that affects icy bodies. Thermal\nphotons emitted from the surfaces of asymmetrically shaped bodies in the Solar\nSystem generate net torques that change the spin rates of these bodies over\ntime. The long-term averaging of this torque is called the YORP effect. Here we\npropose a sublimation-driven analogue to the YORP effect (SYORP), in which\nsublimating gas molecules emitted from the surfaces of icy bodies also generate\nnet torques on the bodies. However, sublimating molecules carry momentum away\nfrom the body at a rate ~10^4-10^5 greater than thermal photons, resulting in\nmuch greater body torques. While previous studies of sublimative torques\nfocused on emissions from highly localized sources on the surfaces of Jupiter\nFamily Comet nuclei, SYORP applies to non-localized emissions across the entire\nbody, which likely dominates sublimation-drive torques on small icy chunks and\nDynamically Young Comets, and can therefore be applied without high-resolution\nspacecraft observations of their surfaces. Instead, we repurpose the equations\nof the YORP effect to account for sublimation-driven torques. We show how an\nSYORP-driven mechanism best matches observations of the Sun-oriented lineaments\n(striae) of comet tails, whose formation mechanism has remained enigmatic for\ndecades. The SYORP effect explains why striae are observed between\nnear-perihelion and ~1 AU from the Sun for comets with perihelia less than 0.6\nAU, and solves longstanding problems with moving enough material into the\ncometary tail to form visible striae.

The extrapolations assume that the\nratio of internal energy of the plasma to magnetic energy, the plasma-beta is\nnegligible. Despite the widespread use of this assumption observations, models,\nand theoretical considerations show that beta is of the order of a few percent\nto more than 10%, and thus not small. We investigate what consequences this has\nfor the reliability of extrapolation results. We use basic concepts starting\nwith the force and the energy balance to infer relations between plasma-beta\nand free magnetic energy, to study the direction of currents in the corona with\nrespect to the magnetic field, and to estimate the errors in the free magnetic\nenergy by neglecting effects of the plasma (beta<<1). A comparison with a 3D\nMHD model supports our basic considerations. If plasma-beta is of the order of\nthe relative free energy (the ratio of the free magnetic energy to the total\nmagnetic energy) then the pressure gradient can balance the Lorentz force. This\nis the case in the solar corona, and therefore the currents are not properly\ndescribed. In particular the error in terms of magnetic energy by neglecting\nthe plasma is of the order of the free magnetic energy, so that the latter can\nnot be reliably determined by an extrapolation. While a force-free\nextrapolation might capture the magnetic structure and connectivity of the\ncoronal magnetic field, the derived currents and free magnetic energy are not\nreliable.

The Mon R2 molecular cloud is an\nideal target since it hosts an H II region association. Column density and\ntemperature images derived from Herschel data were used together to model the\nstructure of HII bubbles and their surrounding envelopes. The resulting\nobservational constraints were used to follow the development of the Mon R2\nionised regions with analytical calculations and numerical simulations. The\nfour hot bubbles associated with H II regions are surrounded by dense, cold,\nand neutral gas envelopes. The radial density profiles are reminiscent of those\nof low-mass protostellar envelopes. The inner parts of envelopes of all four\nHII regions could be free-falling because they display shallow density\nprofiles. As for their outer parts, the two compact HII regions show a density\nprofile, which is typical of the equilibrium structure of an isothermal sphere.\nIn contrast, the central UCHii region shows a steeper outer profile, that could\nbe interpreted as material being forced to collapse.

We then show how the scheme achieving this upper bound can very\nquickly loose its multiplicative caching gain for finite content packetization.\nTo overcome this limitation, we design a novel polynomial-time algorithm based\non greedy local graph-coloring that, while keeping the same content\npacketization, recovers a significant part of the multiplicative caching gain.\nOur results show that the achievable schemes proposed to date to quantify the\nlimiting performance, must be properly designed for practical finite system\nparameters.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, published in ICC 2015. arXiv admin note: text\n  overlap with arXiv:1511.07531"]}]

Thus, the formation of a massive core has to\noccur when the nebular gas is still available in the disk. This phenomenon\nimposes a strong time-scale constraint in giant planet formation due to the\nfact that the lifetimes of the observed protoplanetary disks are in general\nlower than 10 Myr. The formation of massive cores before 10 Myr by accretion of\nbig planetesimals (with radii > 10 km) in the oligarchic growth regime is only\npossible in massive disks.

The Sun shows an activity cycle that is caused by its varying global\nmagnetic field. During a solar cycle, sunspots, i.e. extended regions of strong\nmagnetic fields, occur in activity belts that are slowly migrating from middle\nto lower latitudes, finally arriving close to the equator during the cycle\nmaximum phase. While this have been well known for centuries, much less is\nknown about the solar cycle evolution of small-scale magnetic fields. Aims. To\naddress this question, we study magnetic bright points (MBPs) as proxies for\nsuch small-scale, kG solar magnetic fields. This study is based on a\nhomogeneous data set that covers a period of eight years. Methods. An automated\nMBP identification algorithm was applied to the synoptic Hinode/SOT G-band data\nover the period November 2006 to August 2014, i.e. covering the decreasing\nphase of Cycle 23 and the rise, maximum, and early decrease of Cycle 24.

After a careful\npreselection and monthly median filtering of the data, the investigation\nrevealed that the number of MBPs close to the equator is coupled to the global\nsolar cycle but shifted in time by about 2.5 years.

These findings suggest\nthat there is indeed a coupling between the activity of MBPs close to the\nequator with the global magnetic field.
