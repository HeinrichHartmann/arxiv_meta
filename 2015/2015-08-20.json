The usual representation of the quantum\nalgorithm is limited to the process of solving the problem. We extend it to the\nprocess of setting the problem. The number of the drawer with the ball becomes\na unitary transformation of the random outcome of the preparation measurement.\nThis extended, time-symmetric, representation brings in relational quantum\nmechanics. It is with respect to Bob and any external observer and cannot be\nwith respect to Alice. It would tell her the number of the drawer with the ball\nbefore she opens any drawer. To Alice, the projection of the quantum state due\nto the preparation measurement should be retarded at the end of her search; in\nthe input state of the search, the drawer number is determined to Bob and\nundetermined to Alice. We show that, mathematically, one can ascribe any part\nof the selection of the random outcome of the preparation measurement to the\nfinal Alice's measurement. Ascribing half of it explains the speedup of the\npresent algorithm. This projects the input state to Alice on a state of lower\nentropy where she knows half of the number of the drawer with the ball in\nadvance.

However, electron-ion equilibration timescales can be\ncomparable to the Hubble time in the low density galaxy cluster outskirts,\nleading to differences between the electron and ion temperatures. This\ntemperature difference can lead to systematic biases in cluster mass estimates\nand mass-observable scaling relations. To quantify the impact of\nnon-equilibrium electrons on the ICM profiles in cluster outskirts, we use a\nhigh resolution cosmological simulation with a two-temperature model assuming\nthe Spitzer equilibration timescale for the electrons. First, we show how the\nradial profile of this temperature bias depends on both the mass and mass\naccretion rate of the cluster; the bias is most pronounced in the most massive\nand most rapidly accreting clusters. For the most extreme case in our sample,\nwe find that the bias is of order 10% at half of the cluster virial radius and\nincreases to 40% at the edge of the cluster. We also find that gas in filaments\nis less susceptible to the non-equilibrium effect, leading to azimuthal\nvariations at large cluster-centric radii. By analyzing mock Chandra\nobservations of simulated clusters, we show that such azimuthal variations can\nbe probed with deep X-ray observations. Finally, the mass-dependent temperature\nbias introduces biases in hydrostatic mass and cluster temperature, which has\nimplications for cluster-based cosmological inferences.

It is shown that, if the star's magnetic field is purely\ndipolar, the change in the toroidal field strength required to produce an\nanti-glitch of the observed size can be ~ 10 times larger than previously\ncalculated. If the star has a quadrupolar magnetic field component, then an\nanti-glitch of similar magnitude can be produced via a decay of the quadrupole\ncomponent, in addition to a decay of the toroidal component. We show that, if\nthe quadrupole component decays, the minimum initial toroidal field strength\nand the change in toroidal field strength needed to produce the observed\nanti-glitch are lower than in the pure dipole twisted torus.

Following\nthe techniques used in Li and Liu [2003], we present rigorous analysis of the\nwell-posedness, regularity and time stability for the new model. We also\nstudied both the global and the local behavior of the surface roughness in the\ngrowth process. The new model differs from other known models in that it\nfeatures a linear convex part and a nonlinear concave part, and thus by using a\nconvex-concave time splitting scheme, one can naturally build unconditionally\nstable semi-implicit numerical discretizations with linear implicit parts,\nwhich is much easier to implement than conventional models requiring nonlinear\nimplicit parts. Despite this fundamental difference in the model, numerical\nexperiments show that the nonlinear morphological instability of the new model\nagrees well with results of other models published in Li and Liu [2003], which\nindicates that the new model correctly captures the essential morphological\nstates in the thin film growth process.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 20 figures"]}]

Performance goals for EAs are typically defined by setting upper\nand/or lower bounds for these metrics and specific business transactions. In\norder to ensure that such performance goals can be met, several activities are\nrequired during development and operation of these systems as well as during\nthe transition from Dev to Ops. Activities during development are typically\nsummarized by the term Software Performance Engineering (SPE), whereas\nactivities during operations are called Application Performance Management\n(APM). SPE and APM were historically tackled independently from each other, but\nthe newly emerging DevOps concepts require and enable a tighter integration\nbetween both activity streams. This report presents existing solutions to\nsupport this integration as well as open research challenges in this area.\n"]}]

These images represent the\nfirst model-independent images of cool starspots on a star other than the Sun\nto date. The interferometric observations, taken with the Michigan Infra-Red\nCombiner coupled to the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array,\nspan 26 days from Aug 17$^{th}$, 2008 to Sep 24$^{th}$, 2011. The photometric\ntime series acquired at Fairborn Observatory spanning Sep 20$^{th}$, 2008 to\nJan 20$^{th}$, 2011 is also presented. The angular diameter and power law\nlimb-darkening coefficient of this star are 2.759 $\\pm$ 0.050 mas and 0.229\n$\\pm$ 0.111, respectively. Starspot properties are obtained from both modeled\nand SQUEEZE reconstructed images. The images from 2010 through 2011 show\nanywhere from one to four starspots. The measured properties of identical\nstarspots identified in both the model and reconstructed images are within two\n$\\sigma$ error bars in 51$\\%$ of cases. The cadence in the data for the 2010\nand 2011 data sets are sufficient to measure a stellar rotation period based on\napparent starspot motion. This leads to estimates of the rotation period\n(P$_{2010}$ = 60 $\\pm$ 13 days, P$_{2011}$ = 54.0 $\\pm$ 7.6 days) that are\nconsistent with the photometrically determined period of 54.8 days. In\naddition, the inclination and position angle of the rotation axis is computed\nfor both the 2010 and 2011 data sets; values ($\\bar{\\Psi}$ = 21.5$\\degree$,\n$\\bar{\\emph{i}}$ = 78.0$\\degree$) for each are nearly identical between the two\nyears. \\end{abstract}\n"]}]

Firstly, we present a method to\ntransform a set of time series into a network using different distance\nfunctions, where each time series is represented by a vertex and the most\nsimilar ones are connected. Then, we apply community detection algorithms to\nidentify groups of strongly connected vertices (called a community) and,\nconsequently, identify time series clusters. Still in this paper, we make a\ncomprehensive analysis on the influence of various combinations of time series\ndistance functions, network generation methods and community detection\ntechniques on clustering results. Experimental study shows that the proposed\nnetwork-based approach achieves better results than various classic or\nup-to-date clustering techniques under consideration. Statistical tests confirm\nthat the proposed method outperforms some classic clustering algorithms, such\nas $k$-medoids, diana, median-linkage and centroid-linkage in various data\nsets. Interestingly, the proposed method can effectively detect shape patterns\npresented in time series due to the topological structure of the underlying\nnetwork constructed in the clustering process. At the same time, other\ntechniques fail to identify such patterns. Moreover, the proposed method is\nrobust enough to group time series presenting similar pattern but with time\nshifts and/or amplitude variations. In summary, the main point of the proposed\nmethod is the transformation of time series from time-space domain to\ntopological domain. Therefore, we hope that our approach contributes not only\nfor time series clustering, but also for general time series analysis tasks.\n"]}]
