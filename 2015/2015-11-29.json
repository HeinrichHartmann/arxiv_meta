Your doctor, perhaps implicitly, predicts the effectiveness of a\ntreatment for you based on its performance in a clinical trial; the trial\npatients serve as controls for you. The same logic underpins statistical\ninference: to identify the best statistical procedure to use for a problem, we\nsimulate a set of control problems and evaluate candidate procedures on the\ncontrols. Now for the improvement: recent interest in\npersonalized/individualized medicine stems from the recognition that some\nclinical trial patients are better controls for you than others. Therefore,\ntreatment decisions for you should depend only on a subset of relevant\npatients. Individualized statistical inference implements this idea for control\nproblems (rather than patients). Its potential for improving data analysis\nmatches personalized medicine's for improving healthcare. The central\nissue--for both individualized medicine and individualized inference--is how to\nmake the right relevance robustness trade-off: if we exercise too much\njudgement in determining which controls are relevant, our inferences will not\nbe robust.
