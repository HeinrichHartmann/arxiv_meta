A first inspection reveals\nthe presence of many difficulties but - quite surprisingly - most of them have\nan interesting solution. In particular, it is possible to regularize the\nlattice theory on a Lefschetz thimble, where the imaginary part of the action\nis constant and disappears from all observables.

Another corollary is that a surface of degree\neight that contains a great circle and a little circle through a general point\nis the Clifford translation of a great circle along a little circle. This\npartially confirms a conjecture that celestials in the three-sphere are, up to\nMoebius equivalence, either translational or of degree four\n[Skopenkov-Krasauskas, 2015].

Here, we\npresent a method to compute the many-body hydrodynamic interaction between $N$\nspherical active particles induced by their exterior microhydrodynamic flow.\nFirst, we use a boundary integral representation of the Stokes equation to\neliminate bulk fluid degrees of freedom. Then, we expand the boundary\nvelocities and tractions of the integral representation in an\ninfinite-dimensional basis of tensorial spherical harmonics and, on enforcing\nboundary conditions in a weak sense on the surface of each particle, obtain a\nsystem of linear algebraic equations for the unknown expansion coefficients.\nThe truncation of the infinite series, fixed by the degree of accuracy\nrequired, yields a finite linear system that can be solved accurately and\nefficiently by iterative methods. The solution linearly relates the unknown\nrigid body motion to the known values of the expansion coefficients, motivating\nthe introduction of propulsion matrices. These matrices completely characterize\nhydrodynamic interactions in active suspensions just as mobility matrices\ncompletely characterize hydrodynamic interactions in passive suspensions.

However, at the core of the Gaussian Pyramid is a convolutional\nsmoothing operation, which makes it incapable of generating new features at\ncoarse scales.

Based on the\nanalysis of the focusing properties of the CW low energy proton linac, a 10 MeV\nlow energy normal conducting proton linac based on equidistant seven-gap\nCross-bar H-type (CH) cavities is proposed. The linac is composed of ten 7-gap\nCH cavities and the transverse focusing is maintained by the quadrupole\ndoublets located between cavities. The total length of the linac is less than 6\nmeters and the average acceleration gradient is about 1.2 MeV/m. The\nelectromagnetic properties of the cavities are investigated by Microwave\nStudio. At the nominal acceleration gradient the maximum surface electric field\nin the cavities is less than 1.3 times Kilpatrick limit, and the Ohmic loss of\neach cavity is less than 35 kW. The multi-particle beam dynamics simulations\nare performed with the help of the Tracewin code, the results show that the\nbeam dynamics of the linac is quite stable, and the linac has the capability to\naccelerate up to 30 mA beam with acceptable dynamics behavior.\n","Comment: 9pages, 8figures and two tables"]}]

To improve the robustness of such methods w.r.t. noise\nand missing data, first approaches have recently been proposed that seek to\nembed the underlying PDE into a variational framework with data and smoothness\nterm. So far, however, such methods either make use of a radial depth\nparametrisation that makes the regularisation hard to interpret from a\ngeometrical viewpoint or they consider indirect smoothness terms that require\nadditional consistency constraints to provide valid solutions. Moreover the\nminimisation of such frameworks is an intricate task, since the underlying\nenergy is typically non-convex. In our paper we address all three of the\naforementioned issues. First, we propose a novel variational model that\noperates directly on the Cartesian depth. In this context, we also point out a\ncommon mistake in the derivation of the surface normal. Moreover, we employ a\ndirect second-order regulariser with edge-preservation property. This direct\nregulariser yields by construction valid solutions without requiring additional\nconsistency constraints. Finally, we also propose a novel coarse-to-fine\nminimisation framework based on an alternating explicit scheme.

Although many approaches for improving\nthe robustness of SVMs have been studied, two major challenges remain in robust\nSVM learning. First, robust learning algorithms are essentially formulated as\nnon-convex optimization problems. It is thus important to develop a non-convex\noptimization method for robust SVM that can find a good local optimal solution.\nThe second practical issue is how one can tune the hyperparameter that controls\nthe balance between robustness and efficiency. Unfortunately, due to the\nnon-convexity, robust SVM solutions with slightly different hyper-parameter\nvalues can be significantly different, which makes model selection highly\nunstable. In this paper, we address these two issues simultaneously by\nintroducing a novel homotopy approach to non-convex robust SVM learning. Our\nbasic idea is to introduce parametrized formulations of robust SVM which bridge\nthe standard SVM and fully robust SVM via the parameter that represents the\ninfluence of outliers. We characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions\nof the local optimal solutions of robust SVM, and develop an algorithm that can\ntrace a path of local optimal solutions when the influence of outliers is\ngradually decreased. An advantage of our homotopy approach is that it can be\ninterpreted as simulated annealing, a common approach for finding a good local\noptimal solution in non-convex optimization problems. In addition, our homotopy\nmethod allows stable and efficient model selection based on the path of local\noptimal solutions. Empirical performances of the proposed approach are\ndemonstrated through intensive numerical experiments both on robust\nclassification and regression problems.\n"]}]

Can we, in this project, supply the\n\"elementary foundations\" that Einstein found lacking in his own theory, thereby\nconverting special relativity from (in Einstein's terminology) a \"principle\"\ntheory to a \"constructive\" one? Expanding on the approach suggested by Johns S.\nBell, this paper demonstrates that we can progress toward those goals via the\nintroduction of elementary quantum concepts, particularly the idea of matter\nwaves (deBroglie waves) that was unknown to Einstein in 1905. This quantum\ndynamical approach offers to resolve a recent dispute in philosophy of physics\nregarding the Minkowski geometry of spacetime.\n","Comment: 15 pages (1 figure included in pdf)"]}]

It is a peculiarity of the NRG that\nwhile the Wilson chain is supposed to describe a macroscopic bath, very few\nsingle particle excitations already suffice to essentially thermalize the\nimpurity system at finite temperature, which amounts to having added a\nmacroscopic amount of energy.

This\npolarimeter works by measuring azimuthal asymmetries in the D(\\vec d, n)^{3}He\nreaction and comparing them to known analyzing powers. We built this\npolarimeter to test its performance and to cross-check other existing\npolarimeters at KVI. We were able to use this polarimeter as a vector\npolarimeter, but not as a tensor polarimeter because of an uncertain 'tensor\nanalyzing power' calibration.\n","Comment: 44 pages, 24 figures, Master's thesis at the University of Groningen"]}]
