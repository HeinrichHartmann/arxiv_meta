The method is based on\na new first-order approximation for Langevin diffusions that exploits\nlog-concavity to construct Markov chains with favourable convergence\nproperties. This approximation is closely related to Moreau-Yoshida\nregularisations for convex functions and uses proximity mappings instead of\ngradient mappings to approximate the continuous-time process. The proposed\nmethod complements existing MALA methods in two ways. First, the method is\nshown to have very robust stability properties and to converge geometrically\nfor many target densities for which other MALA are not geometric, or only if\nthe step size is sufficiently small. Second, the method can be applied to\nhigh-dimensional target densities that are not continuously differentiable, a\nclass of distributions that is increasingly used in image processing and\nmachine learning and that is beyond the scope of existing MALA and HMC\nalgorithms. To use this method it is necessary to compute or to approximate\nefficiently the proximity mappings of the logarithm of the target density. For\nseveral popular models, including many Bayesian models used in modern signal\nand image processing and machine learning, this can be achieved with convex\noptimisation algorithms and with approximations based on proximal splitting\ntechniques, which can be implemented in parallel.

All these processes must affect differently in distinct types of\ngalaxies, but the contribution of each one has not been straightforward to\nquantify. In this work, we present a first comprehensive study of the effect of\nthe spiral arms in the formation of thick disks, as going from early to late\ntype disk galaxies, in an attempt to characterize and quantify this specific\nmechanism in galactic potentials. To this purpose, we perform numerical\nsimulations of test particles in a three-dimensional spiral galaxy potential of\nnormal spiral galaxies (from early to late types). By varying the parameters of\nthe spiral arms we found that the vertical heating of the stellar disk becomes\nvery important in some cases, and strongly depends on the galaxy morphology,\npitch angle, arms mass and its pattern speed. The later the galaxy type, the\nlarger is the effect on the disk heating. This study shows that the physical\nmechanism causing the vertical heating is different from simple resonant\nexcitation. The spiral pattern induce chaotic behavior not linked necessarily\nto resonances but to direct scattering of disk stars, which leads to an\nincrease of the velocity dispersion. We applied this study to the specific\nexample of the Milky Way Galaxy, for which we have also added an experiment\nthat includes the Galactic bar.

For the NP-hard nature\nof DCRNP problem, an approximation algorithm-Set-Covering-based Relay Node\nPlacement (SCA) is proposed to solve the DCRNP problem in this paper. The\nproposed SCA algorithm deploys relay nodes iteratively from sink to the given\nsensor nodes in hops, i.e., in the $k$th iteration SCA deploys relay nodes at\nthe locations that are $k$ hops apart from the sink. Specifically, in each\niteration, SCA first finds the candidate deployment locations located within 1\nhop to the relay nodes and sensor nodes, which have already been connected to\nthe sink. Then, a subset of these candidate deployment locations, which can\nguarantee the existence of paths connecting unconnected sensor nodes to the\nsink within delay constraint, is selected to deploy relay nodes based on the\nset covering method. As the iteration of SCA algorithm, the sensor nodes are\ngradually connected to the sink with satisfying delay constraint.\n  The elaborated analysis of the approximation ratio of SCA algorithm is given\nout, and we also prove that the SCA is a polynomial time algorithm through\nrigorous time complexity analysis.

We put forward a new graph limit concept\ncalled log-convergence that is closely connected to dense graph limits but its\nmain applications are in the study of sparse graph sequences. We present an\ninformation theoretic limit concept for $k$-tuples of random variables that is\nbased on the entropy maximization problem for joint distributions of random\nvariables where a system of marginal distributions is prescribed. We give a\nfruitful correspondence between the two limit concepts that has a group\ntheoretic nature. Our applications are in graph theory and information theory.\nWe shows that if $H$ is a bipartite graph, $P_1$ is the edge and $t$ is the\nhomomorphism density function then the supremum of $\\log t(H,G)/\\log t(P_1,G)$\nin the set of all graphs $G$ is the same as in the set of graphs that are both\nedge and vertex transitive.

Our aim is to operate the network such that the profit, i.e.\namount of flow sold to terminals minus cost of injection, is maximized, while\nmaintaining the potentials within prescribed bounds. We also require that the\noperating point is robust with respect to the uncertainty of customers'\nwithdrawals. In this setting we prove that potentials are monotonic functions\nof the withdrawals. This observation enables us to replace in the maximum\nprofit optimization infinitely many nodal constraints, each representing a\nparticular value of withdrawal uncertainty, by only two constraints\nrepresenting the cases where all nodes with uncertainty consume their minimum\nand maximum amounts respectively. We illustrate this general result on example\nof the natural gas transmission network. In this enabling example gas\nwithdrawals by consumers are assumed uncertain, the potentials are gas\npressures squared, the potential drop functions are bilinear in the flow and\nits intensity with an added tunable factor representing compression.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures"]}]

In this first paper, we prove various new estimates for\nthe Ricci flow, and show that they in fact characterize solutions of the Ricci\nflow. Namely, given a family $(M,g_t)_{t\\in I}$ of Riemannian manifolds, we\nconsider the path space $P\\mathcal{M}$ of its space time $\\mathcal{M}=M\\times\nI$. Our first characterization says that $(M,g_t)_{t\\in I}$ evolves by Ricci\nflow if and only if an infinite dimensional gradient estimate holds for all\nfunctions on $P\\mathcal{M}$. We prove additional characterizations in terms of\nthe $C^{1/2}$-regularity of martingales on path space, as well as\ncharacterizations in terms of log-Sobolev and spectral gap inequalities for a\nfamily of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type operators. Our estimates are infinite\ndimensional generalizations of much more elementary estimates for the linear\nheat equation on $(M,g_t)_{t\\in I}$, which themselves generalize the\nBakry-Emery-Ledoux estimates for spaces with lower Ricci curvature bounds.\nBased on our characterizations we can define a notion of weak solutions for the\nRicci flow. We will develop the structure theory of these weak solutions in\nsubsequent papers.\n"]}]
