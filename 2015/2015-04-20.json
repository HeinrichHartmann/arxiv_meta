This task is\ngenerally not achievable without restricting the class of sources over which\nuniversality is desired. Building on our prior work, we propose natural\nfamilies of sources characterized by a common dominating envelope. We\nparticularly emphasize the notion of adaptivity, which is the ability to\nperform as well as an oracle knowing the envelope, without actually knowing it.\nThis is closely related to the notion of hierarchical universal source coding,\nbut with the important difference that families of envelope classes are not\ndiscretely indexed and not necessarily nested.\n  Our contribution is to extend the classes of envelopes over which adaptive\nuniversal source coding is possible, namely by including max-stable\n(heavy-tailed) envelopes which are excellent models in many applications, such\nas natural language modeling. We derive a minimax lower bound on the redundancy\nof any code on such envelope classes, including an oracle that knows the\nenvelope.

A hydrodynamic\nanalogy of a similar type has recently come under criticism by Richardson et\nal., because despite striking similarities at a phenomenological level the\ngoverning equations related to the force on the particle are evidently\ndifferent for the hydrodynamic and the quantum descriptions, respectively.\nHowever, said differences are not relevant if a radically different use of said\nanalogy is being made, thereby essentially referring to emergent processes in\nour model.

We study the consequences of both answers set in a\ndevice (theory) independent framework, based only on observed statistics. We\nstart with taking up post-selection as an assumption and model the same using\nindependent devices governed by Boolean functions. We establish analogy between\nthe post selection functions and the general probabilistic games in a two party\nbinary input-output scenario. As an observation, we categorize all possible\npost-selection functions based on the effect on a uniform input probability\ndistribution. We find that post-selection can transform simple no signaling\nprobability distributions to signaling. Similarly, solving NP complete problems\nis easy independent of classical or quantum computation (in particular we prove\nthat Post RP = NP). Finally, we demonstrate an instance of the violation of the\npigeon hole principle independent of underlying theory. As result of our theory\nindependent modeling we conclude that post-selection as an assumption adds\npower to the underlying theory. In particular, quantum mechanics benefits more\nwith the post-selection assumption, only because it admits a more general set\nof allowed probabilities as compared to the local hidden variable model.\nWithout the assumption we associate a device independent efficiency factor to\nquantify the cost of post selection. Our study shows that in the real world\npost-selection is not efficient enough to be of any advantage. But from an\nadversarial perspective it is still of significance. As an application, we\nobtain robust bounds on faking the bell violation in terms of minimum\nefficiency required using post selection.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 16 tables, 6 figures"]}]

This paper presents a simple algorithm\nwith shorter labels and shorter query time than any previous solution, thereby\nimproving the state-of-the-art with respect to both label length and query time\nin one single algorithm. Our solution addresses several open problems\nconcerning label length and decoding time and is the first improvement of label\nlength for more than three decades.\n  More specifically, we present a distance labeling scheme with label size (log\n3)/2 + o(n) (logarithms are in base 2) and O(1) decoding time.

Specifically, given a target error parameter $\\varepsilon > 0$,\n$m_1$ independent draws from an unknown distribution $p,$ and $m_2$ draws from\nan unknown distribution $q$, we describe a test for distinguishing the case\nthat $p=q$ from the case that $||p-q||_1 \\geq \\varepsilon$. If $p$ and $q$ are\nsupported on at most $n$ elements, then our test is successful with high\nprobability provided $m_1\\geq n^{2/3}/\\varepsilon^{4/3}$ and $m_2 =\n\\Omega(\\max\\{\\frac{n}{\\sqrt m_1\\varepsilon^2}, \\frac{\\sqrt\nn}{\\varepsilon^2}\\});$ we show that this tradeoff is optimal throughout this\nrange, to constant factors. These results extend the recent work of Chan et al.\nwho established the sample complexity when the two samples have equal sizes,\nand tightens the results of Acharya et al. by polynomials factors in both $n$\nand $\\varepsilon$. As a consequence, we obtain an algorithm for estimating the\nmixing time of a Markov chain on $n$ states up to a $\\log n$ factor that uses\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{3/2} \\tau_{mix})$ queries to a \"next node\" oracle, improving upon\nthe $\\tilde{O}(n^{5/3}\\tau_{mix})$ query algorithm of Batu et al. Finally, we\nnote that the core of our testing algorithm is a relatively simple statistic\nthat seems to perform well in practice, both on synthetic data and on natural\nlanguage data.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 3 figures"]}]

The archetype for this class of systems is a colloidal sphere in an\noptical tweezer. Trapped near the focus of a strongly converging beam of light,\nthe particle is displaced by random thermal kicks into the nonconservative part\nof the optical force field arising from radiation pressure, which then biases\nits diffusion. Assuming the particle remains localized within the trap, its\ntime-averaged trajectory traces out a toroidal vortex. Unlike trivial Brownian\nvortexes, such as the biased Brownian pendulum, which circulate preferentially\nin the direction of the bias, the general Brownian vortex can change direction\nand even topology in response to temperature changes.
