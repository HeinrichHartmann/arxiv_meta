Physical systems seem to evolve in\npaths of increasing entropy and of complexity, and thus, the arrow of time\nshall be explored in the context of thermodynamic irreversibility and quantum\nphysics. In Newtonian physics, time flows at a constant rate, the same for all\nobservers; however, it necessarily flows at different rates for different\nobservers in special and general relativity. Special relativity provides\nimportant quantitative elucidations of the fundamental processes related to\ntime dilation effects, and general relativity provides a deep analysis to\neffects of time flow, such as in the presence of gravitational fields. Through\nthe special theory of relativity, time became intimately related with space,\ngiving rise to the notion of spacetime, in which both parameters cannot be\nconsidered as separate entities. As time is incorporated into the proper\nstructure of the fabric of spacetime, it is interesting to note that general\nrelativity is contaminated with non-trivial geometries that generate closed\ntimelike curves, and thus apparently violates causality. The notion of\ncausality is fundamental in the construction of physical theories; therefore\ntime travel and its associated paradoxes have to be treated with great caution.\nThese issues are briefly analyzed in this review paper.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures.

In particular, they shown that, for local\nstabilizer codes in D spatial dimensions, locality preserving gates are\nrestricted to a set of unitary gates known as the D-th level of the Clifford\nhierarchy. In this paper, we elaborate this idea and provide several extensions\nand applications of their characterization in various directions.

For codes with\nnon-Clifford gates (m>2), this improves the previous best bound by Bravyi and\nTerhal. Third we prove that a qubit loss threshold of codes with non-trivial\ntransversal m-th level Clifford logical gate is upper bounded by 1/m. As such,\nno family of fault-tolerant codes with transversal gates in increasing level of\nthe Clifford hierarchy may exist.

A technical\ndifficulty is that, unlike stabilizer codes, the so-called union lemma does not\napply to subsystem codes.

In particular, we\naccount for a variation of the birth-death process (which can also be regarded\nas a proportional imitation rule from social point of view) for the strategy\nupdating under both weak- and strong-selection (meaning the payoffs harvested\nfrom games contribute either slightly or heavily to the individuals'\nperformance). By implementing comparative studies, where the players are\nselected either randomly or in terms of their actual activities to playing\ngames with their immediate neighbors, we figure out that heterogeneous activity\nbenefits the emergence of collective cooperation in harsh environment (the\naction for cooperation is costly) under strong selection, while it impairs the\nformation of altruism under weak selection. Moreover, we find that the\nabundance of communities in the social network can evidently foster the\nfixation of cooperation under strong-selection, in contrast to the games\nevolving on the randomized counterparts. Our results are therefore helpful for\nus to better understand the evolution of cooperation in real social systems.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, all comments are wellcomed"]}]

Since an individual mass measurement\nis only possible for a relatively small number of objects it is crucial to have\nrobust and well understood scaling relations that relate the total mass to\neasily observable quantities. The main goal of this work is to constrain the\ngalaxy group scaling relations corrected for selection effects, and to quantify\nthe influence of non-gravitational physics at the low-mass regime. We analyzed\nXMM-Newton observations for a complete sample of galaxy groups selected from\nthe ROSAT All-Sky Survey and we compared the derived scaling properties with a\ngalaxy cluster sample. To investigate the role played by the different\nnon-gravitational processes we then compared the observational data with the\npredictions of hydrodynamical simulations. After applying the correction for\nselection effects (e.g. Malmquist bias) the L-M relation is steeper than the\nobserved one. Its slope is also steeper than the value obtained by using the\nmore massive systems of the HIFLUGCS sample. This behaviour can be explained by\na gradual change of the true L-M relation which should be taken into account\nwhen converting the observational parameters into masses. The other observed\nscaling relations (not corrected for selection biases) do not show any break\nalthough the comparison with the simulations suggests that feedback processes\nplay an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxy groups. Thanks\nto our master sample of 82 objects spanning two order of magnitude in mass we\ntightly constrain the dependence of the gas mass fraction on the total mass,\nfinding almost a factor of two difference between groups and clusters.\n","Comment: added references, typos added"]}]

In order to better characterise\nplanetary atmospheres we need to consider the effects these clouds will have on\nthe observed broadband transmission spectra. Here we examine the expected cloud\ncondensate species for hot Jupiter exoplanets and the effects of various grain\nsizes and distributions on the resultant transmission spectra from the optical\nto infrared, which can be used as a broad framework when interpreting exoplanet\nspectra. We note that significant infrared absorption features appear in the\ncomputed transmission spectrum, the result of vibrational modes between the key\nspecies in each condensate, which can potentially be very constraining. While\nit may be hard to differentiate between individual condensates in the broad\ntransmission spectra, it may be possible to discern different vibrational\nbonds, which can distinguish between cloud formation scenarios such as\ncondensate clouds or photochemically generated species. Vibrational mode\nfeatures are shown to be prominent when the clouds are composed of small\nsub-micron sized particles and can be associated with an accompanying optical\nscattering slope. These infrared features have potential implications for\nfuture exoplanetary atmosphere studies conducted with JWST, where such\nvibrational modes distinguishing condensate species can be probed at longer\nwavelengths.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

The source positions are determined by estimating the\nlikelihood to be a real source for each peak on the maps and the flux densities\nare estimated using the sourceExtractorTimeline, a timeline-based point source\nfitter. Afterwards, each source is subtracted from the maps, removing a\nGaussian function in every position with the full width half maximum equal to\nthat estimated in sourceExtractorTimeline. This procedure improves the\nrobustness of our algorithm in terms of source identification. The HeViCS\ncatalogs contain about 52000, 42200, and 18700 sources selected at 250, 350,\nand 500 micron above 3sigma and are ~ 75%, 62%, and 50% complete at flux\ndensities of 20 mJy at 250, 350, 500 micron, respectively. We then measured\nsource number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron and we also cross-correlated\nthe catalogs with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the redshift\ndistribution of the nearby sources. From this cross-correlation, we select\n~2000 sources with reliable fluxes and a high signal-to-noise ratio, finding an\naverage redshift z~0.3+/-0.22. The number counts at 250, 350, and 500 micron\nshow an increase in the slope below 200 mJy, indicating a strong evolution in\nnumber of density for galaxies at these fluxes. In general, models tend to\noverpredict the counts at brighter flux densities, underlying the importance of\nstudying the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the spectral energy distribution to refine\nthe theoretical recipes of the models. Our iterative method for source\nidentification allowed the detection of a family of 500 micron sources that are\nnot foreground objects belonging to Virgo and not found in other catalogs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics"]}]

We carried out 3 mm ALMA\nobservations of HCN, HCO+, CCH, CS, HNCO, SiO, HC3N, and SO as well as the 13C\nisotopologues. All species were imaged over the central 2 kpc (~30\") of the\ngalaxy at a resolution of ~2.2\"x1.5 (150 pc x 100 pc). HCO+ and CS appear to be\nslightly enhanced in the star forming ring.

HNCO, SiO and HC3N are significantly enhanced in the\ninner circumnuclear disk surrounding the AGN. Differences in the molecular\nabundances are observed between the star forming ring and the inner\ncircumnuclear disk. We conclude that the HCN/HCO+ and HCN/CS differences\nobserved between AGN dominated and starburst galaxies are not due to a HCN\nenhancement due to X-rays, but rather this enhancement is produced by shocked\nmaterial at distances of 200 pc from the AGN.

By combining the preflight calibration with\nappropriate inflight calibration data including the changes in detector\nperformance over time, we aim at profound knowledge about the accuracy in the\ncalibration. This will be crucial for any correct scientific interpretation of\nspectral features for a wide variety of objects. Methods: Ground calibrations\nalone are not able to fully characterize the instrument. Dedicated inflight\nmeasurements and constant monitoring are essential for a full understanding of\nthe instrument and the variations of the instrument response over time.\nPhysical models of the instrument are tuned to agree with calibration\nmeasurements and are the basis from which the actual instrument response can be\ninterpolated over the full parameter space. Results: Uncertainties in the\ninstrument response have been reduced to < 10% for the effective area and < 6\nmA for the wavelength scale (in the range from 8 A to 34 A. The remaining\nsystematic uncertainty in the detection of weak absorption features has been\nestimated to be 1.5%. Conclusions: Based on a large set of inflight calibration\ndata and comparison with other instruments onboard XMM-Newton, the calibration\naccuracy of the RGS instrument has been improved considerably over the\npreflight calibrations.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Astronomical\n  instrumentation section"]}]

Using the\nJVLA, we have mapped the hot and dense molecular gas in the hot core NGC7538\nIRS1, with 0.2'' angular resolution, in seven metastable (J=K) inversion\ntransitions of ammonia: (J,K)=(6,6), (7,7), (9,9), (10,10), (12,12), (13,13),\nand (14,14). These lines arise from energy levels between ~400 K and ~1950 K\nabove the ground state, and are observed in absorption against the HC-HII\nregion associated with NGC7538 IRS1. With a 500 AU linear resolution, we\nresolve the elongated North-South ammonia structure into two compact\ncomponents: the main core and a southernmost component. Previous observations\nof the radio continuum with a 0.08'' (or 200 AU) resolution, resolved in turn\nthe compact core in two (northern and southern) components. These features\ncorrespond to a triple system of high-mass YSOs IRS1a, IRS1b, and IRS1c\nidentified with VLBI measurements of methanol masers. The velocity maps of the\ncompact core show a clear velocity gradient in all lines, which is indicative\nof rotation in a (circumbinary) envelope, containing ~40 solar masses\n(dynamical mass). In addition, we derived physical conditions of the molecular\ngas: rotational temperatures ~280 K, ammonia column densities ~1.4-2.5 x 10^19\ncm-2, H_2 volume densities ~3.5-6.2 x 10^10 cm-3, and a total gas mass in the\nrange of 19-34 solar masses, for the main core. We conclude that NGC7538 IRS1\nis the densest hot molecular core known, containing a rotating envelope which\nhosts a multiple system of high-mass YSOs, possibly surrounded by accretion\ndisks. Future JVLA observations in the A-configuration are needed to resolve\nthe binary system in the core and may allow to study the gas kinematics in the\naccretion disks associated with individual binary members.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

The sensitivity of such cross-correlation analyses depends, among\nother things, on the separation between the two detectors: the smaller the\nseparation, the better the sensitivity. Hence, a co-located detector pair is\nmore sensitive to a gravitational-wave background than a non-co-located\ndetector pair. However, co-located detectors are also expected to suffer from\ncorrelated noise from instrumental and environmental effects that could\ncontaminate the measurement of the background. Hence, methods to identify and\nmitigate the effects of correlated noise are necessary to achieve the potential\nincrease in sensitivity of co-located detectors. Here we report on the first\nSGWB analysis using the two LIGO Hanford detectors and address the\ncomplications arising from correlated environmental noise. We apply correlated\nnoise identification and mitigation techniques to data taken by the two LIGO\nHanford detectors, H1 and H2, during LIGO's fifth science run. At low\nfrequencies, 40 - 460 Hz, we are unable to sufficiently mitigate the correlated\nnoise to a level where we may confidently measure or bound the stochastic\ngravitational-wave signal. However, at high frequencies, 460-1000 Hz, these\ntechniques are sufficient to set a $95%$ confidence level (C.L.) upper limit on\nthe gravitational-wave energy density of \\Omega(f)<7.7 x 10^{-4} (f/ 900 Hz)^3,\nwhich improves on the previous upper limit by a factor of $\\sim 180$. In doing\nso, we demonstrate techniques that will be useful for future searches using\nadvanced detectors, where correlated noise (e.g., from global magnetic fields)\nmay affect even widely separated detectors.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables"]}]

Starting with\nthe Hamiltonian of the baths plus cavity, we derive an effective model of only\nthe cavity photon states along with analytic expressions for relevant physical\nquantities, such as the stabilization rate.

It is a very hard task, however, which is\ncomplicated by the presence of circumstellar matter in these systems. So far,\nonly a small number of systems with accurate values of component masses, radii,\nand other properties are known. Here, we report the first detailed study of a\nnew representative of this class of binaries, BR CMi, based on the analysis of\nradial velocities and multichannel photometry from several observatories, and\ncompare its physical properties with those for other well-studied systems. BR\nCMi is an ellipsoidal variable seen under an intermediate orbital inclination\nof ~51 degrees, and it has an orbital period of 12.919059(15) d and a circular\norbit. We used the disentangled component spectra to estimate the effective\ntemperatures 9500(200) K and 4655(50) K by comparing them with model spectra.\nThey correspond to spectral types B9.5e and G8III. We also used the\ndisentangled spectra of both binary components as templates for the 2-D\ncross-correlation to obtain accurate RVs and a reliable orbital solution. Some\nevidence of a secular period increase at a rate of 1.1+/-0.5 s per year was\nfound. This, together with a very low mass ratio of 0.06 and a normal mass and\nradius of the mass gaining component, indicates that BR CMi is in a slow phase\nof the mass exchange after the mass-ratio reversal. It thus belongs to a still\npoorly populated subgroup of Be stars for which the origin of Balmer emission\nlines is safely explained as a consequence of mass transfer between the binary\ncomponents.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics. appears in Astronomy and Astrophysics 2014"]}]

We have calculated age and path length of\nGCR protons arriving at the solar system with this stochastic method.

The derived age and path length show a\ndistribution spread in a wide range even for GCR protons arriving at the solar\nsystem with the same energy. The distributions show a cut-off at a lower range\nin age or path length depending on the energy of GCRs. These cut-offs clearly\ncome from the discreteness of occurrence of supernovae. The mean age of GeV\nparticles obtained from the distributions is consistent with the age obtained\nby direct observation of radioactive secondary nuclei.

It is deduced that an almost connected pro-Lie group is separable if\nand only if it is a subspace of a separable Hausdorff space. It is proved that\na locally compact (even feathered) topological group G which is a subgroup of a\nseparable Hausdorff topological group is separable, but the conclusion is false\nif it is assumed only that G is homeomorphic to a subspace of a separable\nTychonoff space. Every precompact topological group of weight less than or\nequal to c is topologically isomorphic to a closed subgroup of a separable\npseudocompact group of weight c. This implies that there is a wealth of closed\nnonseparable subgroups of separable pseudocompact groups. An example is\npresented under CH of a separable countably compact abelian group which\ncontains a non-separable closed subgroup. It is proved that the following\nconditions are equivalent for an omega-narrow topological group G: (i) G is a\nsubspace of a separable regular space; (ii) G is a subgroup of a separable\ntopological group; (iii) G is a closed subgroup of a separable pathconnected\nlocally pathconnected group.\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

The proposed method makes full use of the specific\nstructure of ACO-OFDM signals in the time domain, where half of the positions\nare forced to zeros within an OFDM symbol. The zero-valued positions are\nutilized to carry the clipped error information. Moreover, we accordingly\npresent an optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection for the RoC-ACO-OFDM\nsystem. To facilitate the usage of RoC-ACO-OFDM in practical applications, an\nefficient detection method is further developed with near-optimal performance.\nSimulation results show that the proposed RoC-ACO-OFDM achieves a significant\nPAPR reduction, while maintaining a competitive bit-error rate performance\ncompared with the conventional schemes.\n","Comment: appear in IEEE Photonics Journal"]}]

(FOCS 2014).\n  We also show a mapping from ${\\sf Dictator}$ to ${\\sf XOR}$ that is 3-local,\n2-Lipschitz, and its inverse is $O(\\log(n))$-Lipschitz, where by $L$-local\nmapping we mean that each of its output bits depends on at most $L$ input bits.\n  Next, we consider the problem of finding functions such that any mapping\nbetween them must have large \\emph{average stretch}, where the average stretch\nof a mapping $\\phi$ is defined as ${\\sf avgStretch}(\\phi) = {\\mathbb\nE}_{x,i}[dist(\\phi(x),\\phi(x+e_i)]$. We show that any mapping $\\phi$ from ${\\sf\nXOR}$ to ${\\sf Majority}$ must satisfy ${\\sf avgStretch}(\\phi) \\geq\n\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. In some sense, this gives a \"function analogue\" to the\nquestion of Benjamini et al. (FOCS 2014), who asked whether there exists a set\n$A \\subset \\{0,1\\}^n$ of density 0.5 such that any bijection from\n$\\{0,1\\}^{n-1}$ to $A$ has large average stretch.\n  Finally, we show that for a random balanced function\n$f:\\{0,1\\}^n\\to\\{0,1\\}^n$ with high probability there is a mapping $\\phi$ from\n${\\sf Dictator}$ to $f$ such that both $\\phi$ and $\\phi^{-1}$ have constant\naverage stretch. In particular, this implies that one cannot obtain lower\nbounds on average stretch by taking uniformly random functions.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

The access\nto the cryptographic material used to protect data is implemented using the\nidentification and authentication functionalities of national electronic\nidentity (eID) tokens. All peer to peer dialogs to exchange cryptographic\nmaterial is implemented using the cloud storage facilities. Furthermore, we\nhave included a set of mechanisms to prevent files from being permanently lost\nor damaged due to concurrent modification, deletion and malicious tampering. We\nhave implemented a prototype in Java that is agnostic relatively to cloud\nstorage providers; it only manages local folders, one of them being the local\nimage of a cloud folder. We have successfully tested our prototype in Windows,\nMac OS X and Linux, with Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive and SugarSync.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 1 figure, submitted and presented at OID conference 2014"]}]
