We give the definitive answer to E. I. Zelmanov by\nthis result. It is the consequence of one fact, which is based on combinatorics\nof words. Let l, n and d>n be positive integers. Then all the words over\nalphabet of cardinality l which length is greater than Psi(n,d,l) are either\nn-divided or contain d-th power of subword, where a word W is n-divided, if it\ncan be represented in the following form W=W_0 W_1...W_n such that W_1 >'\nW_2>'...>'W_n. The symbol >' means lexicographical order here. A. I. Shirshov\nproved that the set of non n-divided words over alphabet of cardinality l has\nbounded height h over the set Y consisting of all the words of degree <n.\nOriginal Shirshov's estimation was just recursive, in 1982 double exponent was\nobtained by A.G.Kolotov and in 1993 A.Ya.Belov obtained exponential estimation.\nWe show, that h<Phi(n,l), where Phi(n,l) = 2^{87} n^{12 log_3 n + 48} l.

In particular,\ndecision-support tools for traffic flow management should aid in limiting\ncontroller workload and complexity, while supporting increases in air traffic\nthroughput. While many decision-support tools exist for short-term traffic\nplanning, few have addressed the strategic needs for medium- and long-term\nplanning for time horizons greater than 30 minutes.

Three types of proximity maps are presented: presence\nmaps that indicate the local density of traffic; conflict maps that determine\nlocations and probabilities of potential conflicts; and outliers maps that\nevaluate the probability of conflict due to aircraft not belonging to dominant\ntraffic patterns. These maps provide traffic flow managers with information\nrelating to the complexity and difficulty of managing an airspace. The intended\npurpose of the maps is to anticipate how aircraft flows will interact, and how\noutliers impact the dominant traffic flow for a given time period. This\nformulation is able to predict which \"critical\" regions may be subject to\nconflicts between aircraft, thereby requiring careful monitoring. These\nprobabilities are computed using a generative aircraft flow model.

Such particles can excite Alfven Eigenmodes (AEs), which\nsignificantly degrade their confinement and threatens the vacuum vessel of\nfuture reactors. To develop diagnostics and control schemes, a better\nunderstanding of linear and nonlinear features of resonant interactions between\nplasma waves and high-energy particles, is required. In the case of an isolated\nsingle resonance, the problem is homothetic to the so-called Berk-Breizman (BB)\nproblem, which is an extension of the classic bump-on-tail electrostatic\nproblem, including external damping to a thermal plasma, and collisions. A\nsemi-Lagrangian simulation code, COBBLES, is developed to solve the\ninitial-value BB problem. The nonlinear behavior of instabilities in\nexperimentally-relevant conditions is categorized into steady-state, periodic,\nchaotic, and frequency-sweeping (chirping) regimes. The chaotic regime is shown\nto extend into a linearly stable region, and a mechanism for such subcritical\ninstabilities is proposed. Analytic and semi-empirical laws for nonlinear\nchirping characteristics, such as sweeping-rate, lifetime, and asymmetry, are\ndeveloped and validated. Long-time simulations demonstrate the existence of a\nquasi-periodic chirping regime. Collisional drag and diffusion are shown to be\nessential to reproduce the alternation between major chirping events and\nquiescent phases, which is observed in experiments. Based on these findings, a\nfitting procedure between COBBLES simulations and chirping AE experiments is\ndevelopped. This procedure, which yields local linear drive and external\ndamping rate, is applied to Toroidicity-induced AEs (TAEs) on JT-60U and MAST\ntokamaks. This suggests the existence of TAEs relatively far from marginal\nstability.\n"]}]

A static flattened envelope\nviewed at a small inclination angle does slightly better.\n  We conclude that a geometry of the envelope other than an isotropic static\nsphere is needed to circumvent line optical depth effects.

NASA's Kepler mission has identified\n1235 transiting planet candidates (Borcuki et al 2011). The method of transit\ntiming variations (TTVs) has already confirmed 7 planets in two planetary\nsystems (Holman et al. 2010; Lissauer et al. 2011a). We perform a transit\ntiming analysis of the Kepler planet candidates. We find that at least ~12% of\nplanet candidates currently suitable for TTV analysis show evidence suggestive\nof TTVs, representing at least ~65 TTV candidates. In all cases, the time span\nof observations must increase for TTVs to provide strong constraints on planet\nmasses and/or orbits, as expected based on n-body integrations of multiple\ntransiting planet candidate systems (assuming circular and coplanar orbits). We\nfind that the fraction of planet candidates showing TTVs in this data set does\nnot vary significantly with the number of transiting planet candidates per\nstar, suggesting significant mutual inclinations and that many stars with a\nsingle transiting planet should host additional non-transiting planets. We\nanticipate that Kepler could confirm (or reject) at least ~12 systems with\nmultiple transiting planet candidates via TTVs. Thus, TTVs will provide a\npowerful tool for confirming transiting planets and characterizing the orbital\ndynamics of low-mass planets. If Kepler observations were extended to at least\nsix years, then TTVs would provide much more precise constraints on the\ndynamics of systems with multiple transiting planets and would become sensitive\nto planets with orbital periods extending into the habitable zone of solar-type\nstars.\n","Comment: accepted to ApJS, to appear in Kepler special issue; 35 pages incl. 6\n  figures & 6 tables, excl. 48 pages w/ 4 electronic only tables & 26 pages\n  with additional figures; Additional large electronic only table at\n  http://astro.ufl.edu/~eford/data/kepler/"]}]

To avoid using\na jet veto, one can consider inclusive observables, in which every particle is\nin a jet. We demonstrate that calculating the mass of the hardest jet in\nmultijet events can be problematic, and we give an example of an inclusive\nobservable, asymmetric thrust, which can be resummed to next-to-next-to-leading\nlogarithmic accuracy. Exclusive observables with out-of-jet regions are more\ncomplicated.

Various models and algorithms\nhave been proposed in the literature in the context of the influence\nmaximization problem.

This assumption is\nunrealistic since the influence probabilities are usually private information\nof the individual agents and strategic agents may not reveal them truthfully.\nMoreover, the influence probabilities could vary significantly with the type of\nthe information flowing in the network and the time at which the information is\npropagating in the network.

We focus on threshold-based correlation screening methods for\nthree related applications: screening for variables with large correlations\nwithin a single treatment (autocorrelation screening); screening for variables\nwith large cross-correlations over two treatments (cross-correlation\nscreening); screening for variables that have persistently large\nauto-correlations over two treatments (persistent-correlation screening). The\nnovelty of correlation screening is that it identifies a smaller number of\nvariables which are highly correlated with others, as compared to identifying a\nnumber of correlation parameters. Correlation screening suffers from a phase\ntransition phenomenon: as the correlation threshold decreases the number of\ndiscoveries increases abruptly. We obtain asymptotic expressions for the mean\nnumber of discoveries and the phase transition thresholds as a function of the\nnumber of samples, the number of variables, and the joint sample distribution.\nWe also show that under a weak dependency condition the number of discoveries\nis dominated by a Poisson random variable giving an asymptotic expression for\nthe false positive rate. The correlation screening approach bears tremendous\ndividends in terms of the type and strength of the asymptotic results that can\nbe obtained.

The database was used to study the\nglitch activity among the pulsar population, finding that it peaks for pulsars\nwith a characteristic age tau_c ~ 10kyr and decreases for longer values of\ntau_c, disappearing for objects with tau_c > 20Myr. The glitch activity is also\nsmaller in the very young pulsars (tau_c <~ 1kyr). The cumulative effect of\nglitches, a collection of instantaneous spin up events, acts to reduce the\nregular long term spindown rate |nudot| of the star. The percentage of |nudot|\nreversed by glitch activity was found to vary between 0.5% and 1.6% for pulsars\nwith spindown rates |nudot| between 10^(-14) and 3.2*10^(-11) Hz/s, decreasing\nto less than 0.01% at both higher and lower spindown rates. These ratios are\ninterpreted in terms of the amount of superfluid involved in the generation of\nglitches. In this context the activity of the youngest pulsar studied, the Crab\npulsar, may be explained by quake-like activity within the crust. Pulsars with\nlow spindown rates seem to exhibit mostly small glitches, matching well the\ndecrease of their crustal superfluid.\n  Through the analysis of glitch sizes it was found that the particular\nglitching behaviour of PSR J0537-6910 and the Vela pulsar may be shared by most\nVela-like pulsars.

In this work we study its spectral and timing\nproperties during the 2009 outburst based on Swift and RXTE data. Our spectral\nanalysis of the source indicates only slight spectral shape evolution during\nthe entire outburst. The equivalent width of the iron line and the apparent\narea of the blackbody emission associated with the hotspot at the stellar\nsurface both decrease significantly during the outburst. This is consistent\nwith a gradual receding of the accretion disc as the accretion rate drops. The\npulse profile analysis shows absence of dramatic shape evolution with a\nmoderate decrease in pulse amplitude. This behaviour might result from a\nmovement of the accretion column footprint towards the magnetic pole as the\ndisc retreats. The time lag between the soft and the hard energy pulses\nincrease by a factor of two during the outburst. A physical displacement of the\ncentroid of the accretion shock relative to the blackbody spot or changes in\nthe emissivity pattern of the Comptonization component related to the\nvariations of the accretion column structure could cause this evolution.

Recently, however,\nseveral measurement procedures have been proposed in which the Heisenberg limit\nseemed to be surpassed. This led to an extensive debate over the question how\nthe sensitivity scales with the physical resources and the computational\nresources that are used in estimation procedures. Here, we reconcile the\nphysical definition of the relevant resources with the information-theoretical\nscaling in terms of the query complexity of a quantum network.

The stochastic block model is a common tool\nfor model-based community detection, and asymptotic tools for checking\nconsistency of community detection under the block model have been recently\ndeveloped. However, the block model is limited by its assumption that all nodes\nwithin a community are stochastically equivalent, and provides a poor fit to\nnetworks with hubs or highly varying node degrees within communities, which are\ncommon in practice. The degree-corrected stochastic block model was proposed to\naddress this shortcoming and allows variation in node degrees within a\ncommunity while preserving the overall block community structure. In this paper\nwe establish general theory for checking consistency of community detection\nunder the degree-corrected stochastic block model and compare several community\ndetection criteria under both the standard and the degree-corrected models. We\nshow which criteria are consistent under which models and constraints, as well\nas compare their relative performance in practice. We find that methods based\non the degree-corrected block model, which includes the standard block model as\na special case, are consistent under a wider class of models and that\nmodularity-type methods require parameter constraints for consistency, whereas\nlikelihood-based methods do not. On the other hand, in practice, the degree\ncorrection involves estimating many more parameters, and empirically we find it\nis only worth doing if the node degrees within communities are indeed highly\nvariable.

The extended\nrenormalization group equations, which express the invariance of physical\nobservables under both the renormalization scale- and scheme-parameter\ntransformations, provide a convenient way for estimating the scale- and\nscheme-dependence of the physical process. In this paper, we present a solution\nfor the scale-equation of the extended renormalization group equations at the\nfour-loop level. Using the principle of maximum conformality (PMC) /\nBrodsky-Lepage-Mackenzie (BLM) scale-setting method, all non-conformal\n$\\{\\beta_i\\}$ terms in the perturbative expansion series can be summed into the\nrunning coupling, and the resulting scale-fixed predictions are independent of\nthe renormalization scheme. Different schemes lead to different effective\nPMC/BLM scales, but the final results are scheme independent. Conversely, from\nthe requirement of scheme independence, one not only can obtain\nscheme-independent commensurate scale relations among different observables,\nbut also determine the scale displacements among the PMC/BLM scales which are\nderived under different schemes. In principle, the PMC/BLM scales can be fixed\norder-by-order, and as a useful reference, we present a systematic and\nscheme-independent procedure for setting PMC/BLM scales up to NNLO. An explicit\napplication for determining the scale setting of $R_{e^{+}e^-}(Q)$ up to four\nloops is presented.

We\nalso observe that in this formulation there is a simple formal proof of the\nfact that type IIA spacetime with a D0-brane condensate is the 11-dimensional\nsugra/M-theory spacetime, and of (prequantum) S-duality for type IIB string\ntheory.

Merging pairs of such triangles into dimers, the\nplasmon hybridization leads to energy splitting in accordance with\nplasmon-hybridization theory, with a lower energy for the antisymmetric modes\nand a smaller splitting for modes with less confinement to the gap region. The\nhybridization appears strongest in classical calculations while the splitting\nis lower for armchair edges and even more reduced for zigzag edges.

Such systems\nmake mandatory the design of more sophisticated techniques not only for\ntransporting, storing and processing this new generation of radio\ninterferometric data, but also for restoring the astrophysical information\ncontained in such data. In this paper we present a new radio deconvolution\nalgorithm named MORESANE and its application to fully realistic simulated data\nof MeerKAT, one of the SKA precursors. This method has been designed for the\ndifficult case of restoring diffuse astronomical sources which are faint in\nbrightness, complex in morphology and possibly buried in the dirty beam's side\nlobes of bright radio sources in the field. MORESANE is a greedy algorithm\nwhich combines complementary types of sparse recovery methods in order to\nreconstruct the most appropriate sky model from observed radio visibilities. A\nsynthesis approach is used for the reconstruction of images, in which the\nsynthesis atoms representing the unknown sources are learned using analysis\npriors. We apply this new deconvolution method to fully realistic simulations\nof radio observations of a galaxy cluster and of an HII region in M31. We show\nthat MORESANE is able to efficiently reconstruct images composed from a wide\nvariety of sources from radio interferometric data. Comparisons with other\navailable algorithms, which include multi-scale CLEAN and the recently proposed\nmethods by Li et al. (2011) and Carrillo et al. (2012), indicate that MORESANE\nprovides competitive results in terms of both total flux/surface brightness\nconservation and fidelity of the reconstructed model. MORESANE seems\nparticularly well suited for the recovery of diffuse and extended sources, as\nwell as bright and compact radio sources known to be hosted in galaxy clusters.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication on A&A"]}]

The conventional treatment is to take a typical momentum\nas the renormalization scale, which assigns an arbitrary range and an arbitrary\nsystematic error to pQCD predictions, leading to the well-known renormalization\nscheme and scale ambiguities. As a practical solution for such scale setting\nproblem, the \"Principle of Minimum Sensitivity\" (PMS), has been proposed in the\nliterature.

Using the galaxy formation SAM GALFORM, we create\nmock galaxy SEDs using realistic star formation histories (SFH) and add an AGN\nof Type 1, Type 2, or intermediate type whose contribution to the bolometric\nluminosity can be variable. We perform an SED fitting of these catalogues with\nCIGALE assuming three different SFHs: a single- and\ndouble-exponentially-decreasing, and a delayed SFH. Constraining\nthecontribution of an AGN to the LIR (fracAGN) is very challenging for\nfracAGN<20%, with uncertainties of ~5-30% for higher fractions depending on the\nAGN type, while FIR and sub-mm are essential. The AGN power has an impact on\nthe estimation of $M_*$ in Type 1 and intermediate type AGNs but has no effect\nfor galaxies hosting Type 2 AGNs. We find that in the absence of AGN emission,\nthe best estimates of $M_*$ are obtained using the\ndouble-exponentially-decreasing model but at the expense of realistic ages of\nthe stellar population. The delayed SFH model provides good estimates of $M_*$\nand SFR, with a maximum offset of 10% as well as better estimates of the age.\nOur analysis shows that the underestimation of the SFR increases with fracAGN\nfor Type 1 systems, as well as for low contributions of an intermediate AGN\ntype, but it is quite insensitive to the emission of Type 2 AGNs up to\nfracAGN~45%. Similarly the UV emission is critical in accurately retrieving the\n$M_*$ for Type 1 and intermediate type AGN, and the SFR of all of the three AGN\ntypes.

A good agreement with CosmoRec is found\nafter changing this aspect. Using Planck 2013 data and considering only the\neffect of PMF-induced heating, we find an upper limit on the r.m.s. magnetic\nfield amplitude of B0 < 1.1 nG (95% c.l.) for a stochastic background of PMF\nwith a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum. We also discuss uncertainties\nrelated to the approximations for the heating rates and differences with\nrespect to previous studies. Our results are important for the derivation of\nconstraints on the PMF power spectrum obtained from measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background anisotropies with full-mission Planck data. They may also\nchange some of the calculations of PMF-induced effects on the primordial\nchemistry and 21cm signals.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRAS"]}]

In\nthis approach, one has to solve two large scale Toeplitz linear systems in\nadvance. However, if the desired accuracy is high, the cost will be\nprohibitive. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how to solve the\nToeplitz systems inexactly in this method. The contribution of this paper is in\nthree regards. First, we give a new stability analysis on the Gohberg-Semencul\nformula (GSF) and define the GSF condition number of a Toeplitz matrix. It is\nshown that, when the size of the Toeplitz matrix is large, our result is\nsharper than the one given in [M. Gutknecht and M.

Second, we establish a relation between the error of\nToeplitz systems and the residual of Toeplitz matrix exponential. We show that\nif the GSF condition number of the Toeplitz matrix is medium sized, then the\nToeplitz systems can be solved in a low accuracy. Third, based on this\nrelationship, we present a practical stopping criterion for relaxing the\naccuracy of the Toeplitz systems, and propose an inexact shift-and-invert\nArnoldi algorithm for the Toeplitz matrix exponential problem.

However, in reality, it is\neasier for us to observe the timestamps when different nodes in the network\nreact on a message, while the connections empowering the diffusion of the\nmessage remain hidden. This motivates recent extensive studies on the network\ninference problem: unveiling the edges from the records of messages\ndisseminated through them. Existing solutions are computationally expensive,\nwhich motivates us to develop an efficient two-step general framework,\nClustering Embedded Network Inference (CENI). CENI integrates clustering\nstrategies to improve the efficiency of network inference. By clustering nodes\ndirectly on the timelines of messages, we propose two naive implementations of\nCENI: Infection-centric CENI and Cascade-centric CENI. Additionally, we point\nout the critical dimension problem of CENI: instead of one-dimensional\ntimelines, we need to first project the nodes to an Euclidean space of certain\ndimension before clustering. A CENI adopting clustering method on the projected\nspace can better preserve the structure hidden in the cascades, and generate\nmore accurately inferred links. This insight sheds light on other related work\nattempting to discover or utilize the latent cluster structure in the\ndisseminated messages.

Both windows have been validated at low power, showing good agreement\nbetween measured and modeling, with a return loss better than 32 dB and an\ninsertion loss below 0.05 dB. This paper reports on the window RF design and\nthe low power measurements. The high power tests up to 500kW have been carried\nout in March 2013 in collaboration with NFRI. Results of these tests are also\nreported. In the current ITER LHCD design, 20 MW Continuous Wave (CW) of\nRadio-Frequency power at 5 GHz are expected to be generated and transmitted to\nthe plasma. In order to separate the vacuum vessel pressure from the cryostat\nwaveguide pressure, forty eight 5 GHz 500kW CW windows are to be assembled on\nthe waveguides at the equatorial port flange. For nuclear safety reasons, forty\neight additional windows could be located in the cryostat section, to separate\nand monitor the cryostat waveguide pressure from the exterior transmission line\npressure. These windows are identified as being one of the main critical\ncomponents for the ITER LHCD system since first ITER LHCD studies [1] [2] [3]\nor more recently [4] [5] , and clearly require an important R\\&D effort.

The heat losses in the ceramic, which have to be\nextracted by an active water cooling, depends on the inside electric field\ntopology and of ceramic dielectric loss (loss tangent).

Release trajectory management is a\ndifficult and crucial task. Managers must be aware of every aspect of the\ndevelopment process for managing the software-related issues. Issue Tracking\nSystems (ITS) play a central role in supporting the management of release\ntrajectory. These systems, which support reporting and tracking issues of\ndifferent kinds (such as \"bug\", \"feature\", \"improvement\", etc.), record rich\ndata about the software development process.

Release trajectory analysis is based on the categories of tracked\nissues and their temporal changing, and aims to address important questions\nregarding the co-habitation of unresolved issues, the transitions between\ndifferent statuses in release trajectory, the recurrent patterns of release\ntrajectories, and the properties of a release trajectory.\n","Comment: DIRO technical report, draft, undersubmission"]}]
