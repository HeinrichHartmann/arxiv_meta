At this stage of the investigation, only\nthe vertical magnetic field and the horizontal flows are used for a qualitative\nanalysis.

No violent spreading flows on the scale of the entire growing\nmagnetic region can be identified. Instead, normal mesogranular and\nsupergranular flows are preserved. The observed scenario of evolution seems to\nagree with Bumba's inference that the development of an active region does not\nentail the destruction of the existing convective-velocity field.

For Dirac\n(Majorana) dark matter that annihilates via mediators charged as left-handed\nsleptons, we find an upper bound around 45 TeV (7 TeV) for both the mediator\nand dark matter masses, respectively. These bounds vary as the square root of\nthe number of colors times the number of flavors involved. Therefore the bounds\ndiminish by root two for right handed selectrons.

In 1994, Bronniman and Goodrich\nmade an important connection of this problem to the size of fundamental\ncombinatorial structures called $\\epsilon$-nets, showing that small-sized\n$\\epsilon$-nets imply approximation algorithms with correspondingly small\napproximation ratios.

Thus the approximation\nfactor of the Agarwal and Pan algorithm ends up being more than $40$.

Here, we introduce a modified version of the directional\nanisotropic diffusion which allows us to simultaneously reduce the noise and\nenhance vascular structures reconstructed using both M/mIP angiograms.

Also, the approach of using vesselness\nmeasure to steer the diffusion process results in structural discontinuities\ndue to junction suppression in mIP.

The most prominent feature of penetrating gradient algorithm, after\nwhich it was named, is its ability to see and penetrate through the obstacles\nin error space along the line of search direction and to jump to the global\nminimizer in a single step. The ability to find the deepest point in an\narbitrary direction, no matter how distant the point is and regardless of the\nrelief of error space between the current and the best point, motivates\nmovements in directions in which cost function can be maximally reduced, rather\nthan in directions that seem to be the best locally (like, for instance, the\nsteepest descent, i.e., negative gradient direction). Therefore, the strategy\nis named the deepest descent, in contrast but alluding to the steepest descent.\nPenetrating gradient algorithm is derived and its properties are proven\nmathematically, while features of the deepest descent strategy are shown by\ncomparative simulations.

However, this assumption may not be valid for situations where graph\ntopologies are subject to uncertainties either due to changes in the physical\nnetwork or the presence of modeling errors especially for multiagent systems\ninvolving a large number of interacting agents. Motivating from this\nstandpoint, this paper studies distributed control of networked multiagent\nsystems with uncertain graph topologies. The proposed framework involves a\ncontroller architecture that has an ability to adapt its feed- back gains in\nresponse to system variations.

A feature of the new\nphenomenon is, that bunched and antibunched light is emitted in different\nspatial directions. The calculations are performed analytically. It is pointed\nout, that the correlations are induced by state reduction due to the\nmeasurement process when the detection of the photons does not distinguish\nbetween the atoms. It is interesting to note, that the phenomena show up even\nwithout any interatomic interaction.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 6 Figures"]}]

For\nintensity measurements this problem is equivalent to Young's double slit\nexperiment and was investigated in an experiment by Eichmann et al. [Phys. Rev.\nLett. 70, 2359 (1993)] and later analyzed in detail by Itano et al. [Phys. Rev.\nA 57, 4176 (1998)].
