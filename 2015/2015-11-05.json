First,\nwe show that Yee's finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme, along with a\nnumber of related methods, are multisymplectic and derive from a discrete\nLagrangian variational principle. Second, we generalize the Yee scheme to\nunstructured meshes, not just in space but in 4-dimensional spacetime. This\nrelaxes the need to take uniform time steps, or even to have a preferred time\ncoordinate at all. Finally, as an example of the type of methods that can be\ndeveloped within this general framework, we introduce a new asynchronous\nvariational integrator (AVI) for solving Maxwell's equations.

While sensitivity analyses in\nmatched observational studies have been well addressed when there is a single\noutcome variable, accounting for multiple comparisons through the existing\nmethods yields overly conservative results when there are multiple outcome\nvariables of interest. This stems from the fact that unmeasured confounding\ncannot affect the probability of assignment to treatment differently depending\non the outcome being analyzed.

These $1 + 1$ dimensional models are describable as decoupling\nlimits of the near horizon geometry of higher dimensional extremal black holes\nor black branes, and this suggests that deformations of the simplest model are\nequally physical. After proposing a notion of \"relevant deformations\", we\ndescribe deformations, which contain excitations corresponding to linear\ndilaton black holes, some of which can be considered as UV completions of the\nCGHS model. We study the question of whether the AMPS paradox can be formulated\nin those models. It cannot, because the classical in-fall time to the\nsingularity of linear dilaton black holes, is independent of the black hole\nmass. This result is reproduced by our HST models. We argue that it is related\nto the absence of quasi-normal modes of these black hole solutions, which is\nitself related to the fact that the horizon has zero area. This is compatible\nwith the resolution of the AMPS paradox proposed in previous work with\nFischler, according to which the compatibility conditions of HST identify the\nlong non-singular sojourn of observers behind the horizon, with the dynamics of\nequilibration on the horizon as seen by a detector which has not yet fallen\nthrough the horizon.\n","Comment: 24 Pages, LaTeX2e, v.3: Typos corrected, important references added"]}]

Here we examine this phenomenon from the\nperspective of matrix representations of the commutator $\\mathcal{H}\n=[H,\\bullet]$ ,with the aim of characterising the multi-particle content of the\nmany-body Majorana mode. To do this we show that, for quadratic fermionic\nsystems, $\\mathcal{H}$ can always be decomposed into sub-blocks that act as\nmulti-particle generalisations of the BdG/Majorana forms that encode\nsingle-particle excitations. In this picture, density-density like interactions\nwill break this exact excitation-number symmetry, coupling different sub-blocks\nand lifting degeneracies so that the eigen-operators of the commutator\n$\\mathcal{H}$ take the form of individual eigenstate transitions $|n\\rangle\n\\langle m|$. However, the Majorana mode is special in that zero-energy\ntransitions are not destroyed by local interactions and it becomes possible to\ndefine many-body Majoranas as the odd-parity zero-energy solutions of\n$\\mathcal{H}$ that minimise their excitation number. This idea forms the basis\nfor an algorithm which is used to characterise the multi-particle excitation\ncontent of the Majorana zero modes of the one-dimensional p-wave lattice model.\nWe find that the multi-particle content of the Majorana zero-mode operators is\nsignificant even at modest interaction strengths. This has important\nconsequences for the stability of Majorana based qubits when they are coupled\nto a heat bath.

We considered all five archival XMM-Newton observations, and we\napplied the 'flux-flux plot' (FFP) method. We found that the flux-flux plots\nwere highly affected by the choice of the light curves' time bin size, most\nprobably because of the fast and large amplitude variations, and the intrinsic\nnon-linear flux--flux relations in this source. Therefore, we recommend that\nthe smallest bin-size should be used in such cases. Hence, We constructed FFPs\nin 11 energy bands below 1.7 keV, and we considered the 1.7-3 keV band, as\nbeing representative of the primary emission. The FFPs are reasonably well\nfitted by a 'power-law plus a constant' model. We detected significant positive\nconstants in three out of five observations. The best-fit slopes are flatter\nthan unity at energies below $\\sim 0.9$ keV, where the soft excess is\nstrongest. This suggests the presence of intrinsic spectral variability. A\npower-law-like primary component, which is variable in flux and spectral slope\n(as $\\Gamma\\propto N_{\\rm PL}^{0.1}$) and a soft-excess component, which varies\nwith the primary continuum (as $F_{\\rm excess}\\propto F_{\\rm primary}^{0.46}$),\ncan broadly explain the FFPs. In fact, this can create positive `constants',\neven when a stable spectral component does not exist.

LambdaMART is the state-of-the-art algorithm in learning to\nrank which relies on such a metric.

Here, we propose a design path to control the absorption and\nscattering characteristics of a dipole nanoantenna by introducing a hollow\nregion inside the nanostructure. The resulting contour geometry can\nsignificantly suppress the scattering of the dipole nanoantenna and enhance its\nabsorption simultaneously. Both the dipole and the contour dipole nanoantenna\ncouple to equivalent amount of the incident radiation. The dipole nanoantenna\nscatters 84% of the coupled power (absorbs the remaining 16%) whereas the\ncontour dipole structure scatters only 28% of the coupled power (absorbs the\nremaining 72%). This constitutes the transformation from scatter to absorber\nnanoantenna. The scattering of a contour nanoantenna can be further suppressed\nby incorporating a lossless dielectric in the hollow region without altering\nits absorption. We also demonstrate the applicability of scattering suppression\nand absorption enhancement features of the contour design in other nanoantenna\ngeometries such as the self-assembly compatible nanoantenna structures of\nnanodisk and nanoring chains.

For two alternating orientations of the adsorbed\ndipoles or dipoles and alkyl chains, bi-stability of anchoring can be obtained.\nThe results are explained using the introduction of fourth order terms in the\nphenomenological anchoring potential, leading to the demonstration of first\norder anchoring transition in these systems. Using this phenomenological\nanchoring potential, we finally show how the nature of anchoring in presence of\ndual easy axes (inducing bi-stability or average orientation between the two\neasy axes) can be related to the microscopical nature of the interface.\nIntroduction Understanding the interactions between liquid crystal (LC) and a\nsolid substrate is of clear applied interest, the vast majority of LC displays\nrelying on control of interfaces. However this concerns also fundamental\nproblems like wetting phenomena and all phenomena of orientation of soft matter\nbulk induced by the presence of an interface. In LCs at interfaces, the\nso-called easy axes correspond to the favoured orientations of the LC director\nclose to the interface. If one easy axis only is defined for one given\ninterface, the bulk director orients along or close to this axis [1]. It is\nwell known that, in anchoring phenomena, two major effects compete to impose\nthe anchoring directions of a liquid crystal, first, the interactions between\nmolecules and the interface, second, the substrate roughness whose role has\nbeen analyzed by Berreman [2]. The influence of adsorbed molecular functional\ngroups at the interface is most often dominant with, for example in carbon\nsubstrates, a main influence of unsaturated carbon bonds orientation at the\ninterface [3]. In common LC displays, there is one unique easy axis, but\nmodifications of surfaces have allowed for the discovery of promising new\nanchoring-related properties. For instance, the first anchoring bi-stability\nhas been established on rough surfaces, associated with electric\nordo-polarization [4] and the competition between a stabilizing short-range\nterm and a destabilizing long-range term induced by an external field, can\ninduce a continuous variation of anchoring orientation [5]. More recently,\nsurfaces with several easy axes have been studied extensively. It has been\nshown that control of a continuous variation of director pretilt, obtained in\nseveral systems [6, 7], is associated with the presence of two different easy\naxes, one perpendicular to the substrate (homeotropic) and one planar [7, 8].\nSimilar models can explain the continuous evolution of anchoring between two\nplanar orientations observed on some crystalline substrates [9]. However, in\nthe same time, two easy axes can also lead to anchoring bi-stability [10, 11]\nor discontinuous transitions of anchoring [9], which is not compatible with the\nmodel established to interpret observed control of pretilt. In order to be able\nto predict if bi-stability or continuous combination of the two easy axes\noccurs for one given system, it becomes necessary to understand the microscopic\norigin of the easy axes.\n","Comment: in Soft Matter, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2011"]}]

In this range,\nthe maximum load is represented as a function of the compression rate,\nslenderness ratio, and imperfection/initial deflection. Considering the results\nwe answer the following question: \"How slowly the column should be compressed\nin order to measure static load-bearing capacity?\" This question is important\nfor the proper setup of laboratory experiments and computer simulations of\nbuckling.\n  Additionally, it is shown that the behavior of a perfect column having an\ninitial deflection differ significantlys form the behavior of an imperfect\ncolumn. In particular, the dependence of the maximum force on the compression\nrate is non-monotonic.

Test results show that through non-uniform constellation and\nasymmetric symbol mapping, it is possible to significantly reduce the\ndistortion while preserving bandwidth efficiency. Tests performed on real\nsignals based on perceptual quality measurements allow validating the proposed\nscheme against conventional 64-APSK constellations and CCSDS mapping.\n"]}]

The channels in these systems may undergo peristaltic\npumping which is thought to enhance the material exchange. To date, little\nanalytic work has been done to study the effect of pumping on material\nextraction across the channel walls. In this paper, we examine a fluid\nextraction model in which fluid flowing through a leaky channel is exchanged\nwith fluid in a reservoir. The channel walls are allowed to contract and expand\nuniformly, simulating a pumping mechanism. In order to efficiently determine\nsolutions of the model, we derive a formal power series solution for the Stokes\nequations in a finite channel with uniformly contracting/expanding permeable\nwalls. This flow has been well studied in the case of weakly permeable channel\nwalls in which the normal velocity at the channel walls is proportional to the\nwall velocity. In contrast we do not assume weakly driven flow, but flow driven\nby hydrostatic pressure, and we use Dacry's law to close our system for normal\nwall velocity. We use our flow solution to examine flux across the\nchannel-reservoir barrier and demonstrate that pumping can either enhance or\nimpede fluid extraction across channel walls. We find that associated with each\nset of physical flow and pumping parameters, there are optimal reservoir\nconditions that maximizes the amount of material flowing from the channel into\nthe reservoir.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 10 figures"]}]
