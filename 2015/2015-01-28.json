As a matter of fact, the significance of previously claimed detections\nof a preferred direction in the Union2 dataset completely disappears once we\ninclude the effects of using the full covariance matrix.

We thus find that current SNIa surveys\nare inappropriate to test anisotropic features due to their highly\nnon-homogeneous angular distribution in the sky.

Pairing correlations are treated in the BCS\napproximation with a separable pairing force of finite range. Two-dimensional\nPES's of $^{226,228,230,232}$Th and $^{232,234,236,238}$U are mapped and the\nthird minima on these surfaces are located. Then one-dimensional potential\nenergy curves along the fission path are analyzed in detail and the energies of\nthe second barrier, the third minimum, and the third barrier are determined.\nDD-ME2 predicts the occurrence of a third barrier in all Th nuclei and\n$^{238}$U. The third minima in $^{230,232}$Th are very shallow, whereas those\nin $^{226,228}$Th and $^{238}$U are quite prominent. With PC-PK1 a third\nbarrier is found only in $^{226,228,230}$Th. Single-nucleon levels around the\nFermi surface are analyzed in $^{226}$Th, and it is found that the formation of\nthe third minimum is mainly due to the $Z=90$ proton energy gap at $\\beta_{20}\n\\approx 1.5$ and $\\beta_{30} \\approx 0.7$. The possible occurrence of a third\nbarrier in actinide nuclei depends on the effective interaction used in\nmultidimensional CDFT calculations. More pronounced minima are predicted by the\nDD-ME2 functional, as compared to the functional PC-PK1. The depth of the third\nwell in Th isotopes decreases with increasing neutron number. The origin of the\nthird minimum is due to the proton $Z=90$ shell gap at relevant deformations.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures; Phys. Rev.

The data reduction is also intended to improve\nthe standard source detection on individual observations, by cataloguing faint\nsources by stacking their exposure images. We reprocessed the XMM-OM data of\nthe survey and stacked the exposures from consecutive observations using the\nstandard SAS tools to process the data obtained during single observations.\nAverage measurements of detections with SAS good quality flags from individual\nobservations and from stacked images were joined to compile the catalogue.\nSources were validated through the cross-identification within the EIS and\nCOMBO-17 surveys. Photometric data of 1129 CDFS sources are provided in the\ncatalogue, and optical/UV/X-ray photometric and spectroscopic information from\nother surveys are also included. The stacking extends the detection limits by\n~1 mag in the three UV bands, contributing 30% of the catalogued UV sources.\nThe comparison with the available measurements in similar spectral bands\nconfirms the validity of the XMM-OM calibration. The combined COMBO-17/X-ray\nclassification of the \"intermediate\" sources (e.g. optically diluted and/or\nX-ray absorbed AGN) is also discussed.\n","Comment: Change of numbering in the title, language corrections, version\n  corresponding to that in press, 15 pages, 12 Figures, to appear on Astronomy\n  and Astrophysics.

First, we\ndescribe our framework and discuss the reliability of the inversion technique\nand the possible sources of error.We then apply this methodology to the\nacoustic radius, an age indicator based on the sound speed derivative and the\nmean density and compare it to estimates based on the average large and small\nfrequency separations. These inversions are carried out for several test cases\nwhich include: various metallicities, different mixing-lengths, non-adiabatic\neffects and turbulent pressure. Results. We observe that the SOLA method yields\naccurate results in all test cases whereas results based on the large and small\nfrequency separations are less accurate and more sensitive to surface effects\nand structural differences in the models. If we include the surface corrections\nof Kjeldsen et al. (2008), we obtain results of comparable accuracy for the\nmean density. Overall, the mean density and acoustic radius inversions are more\nrobust than the inversions for the age indicator. Moreover, the current\napproach is limited to relatively young stars with radiative cores. Increasing\nthe number of observed frequencies improves the reliability and accuracy of the\nmethod.\n"]}]

The national cumulative curves of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone,\nand Liberia show periods of approximate exponential growth. In contrast, local\nepidemics are asynchronous and exhibit slow growth patterns during 3 or more\nEVD generations, which can be better approximated by a polynomial than an\nexponential. Conclusions: The slower than expected growth pattern of local EVD\noutbreaks could result from a variety of factors, including behavior changes,\nsuccess of control interventions, or intrinsic features of the disease such as\na high level of clustering.

Regular EMCCD operations have\nbeen running at the Danish telescope for several years and have produced a\nnumber of scientific discoveries, including microlensing detected exoplanets,\nthe detection of previously unknown variable stars in dense globular clusters\nand the discovery of two rings around the small asteroid-like object (10199)\nChariklo.\n","Comment: Accepted to A&A, 17 pages, 15 figures"]}]

We aim to provide a tool that can be\nused to estimate the presence of magnetic fields in the neighbourhood of a\ncompact object and to probe the cosmic censorship conjecture in these\nparticular astrophysical environments. We developed a numerical scheme able to\ncalculate thermal spectra of magnetised Page-Thorne accretion discs formed\naround rotating black holes and naked singularities as seen by an arbitrary\ndistant observer. We incorporated two different magnetic field configurations:\nuniform and dipolar, using a perturbative scheme in the coupling constant\nbetween matter and magnetic field strength. Under the same assumptions, we\nobtained observed synthetic line profiles of the 6.4 keV fluorescent iron line.\nWe show that an external magnetic field produces potentially observable\nmodifications on the thermal energy spectrum and the fluorescent iron line\nprofile. Thermal energy spectra of naked singularities are harder and brighter\nthan those from black holes, and in addition, peak and cut-off energies are\naffected by the external magnetic field. Moreover, iron line profiles of slowly\nrotating black holes suffer more changes by a uniform magnetic field, while\nnearly extremal black holes and naked singularities are more altered in the\ndipolar case. Based on our calculations, we discard the possibility of\nmodelling the archetypal black-hole candidate in Cygnus X-1 as a naked\nsingularity. Comparison of our models with observational data can be used to\nprobe the cosmic censorship conjecture and to estimate the existence and global\ngeometry of magnetic fields around compact objects by fitting the thermal\nenergy spectra and iron line profiles of X-ray binaries.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures.

A simple qualitative examination of visibility profiles allows us to\nidentify a rapid drop-off in the visibilities at short baselines in 8 resolved\ndisks. This is indicative of a significant contribution from an extended\ncontribution of light from the disk. We demonstrate that this component is\ncompatible with scattered light, providing strong support to a prediction made\nby Pinte et al. (2008). The amplitude of the drop-off and the amount of dust\nthermal emission changes from source to source suggesting that each disk is\ndifferent. A by-product of the survey is the identification of a new\nmilli-arcsec separation binary: WW Cha.

One of the\nsuccessful approaches for denoising relies on the notion of unbiased risk\nestimation, which enables one to obtain a useful substitute for the mean-square\nerror. For the case of additive white Gaussian noise contamination, the risk\nestimation procedure relies on Stein's lemma.

We\nexemplify this `rigid holography' by studying in detail the 6d N=(2,0) A_{K-1}\nsuperconformal field theory (SCFT) on AdS_5xS^1, with equal radii for AdS_5 and\nfor S^1.

On\nAdS_5xS^1, the theory has a 2(K-1)-dimensional `moduli space' of supersymmetric\nconfigurations. We argue that in this case the SU(K) gauge symmetry is unbroken\neverywhere in the `moduli space' and that this 5d gauge theory is coupled to a\n4d theory on the boundary of AdS_5 whose coupling constants depend on the\n`moduli'. This involves non-standard boundary conditions for the gauge fields\non AdS_5. Near the origin of the `moduli space', the theory on the boundary\ncontains a weakly coupled 4d N=2 supersymmetric SU(K) gauge theory.

Transverse\nmomentum spectra of baryons from RHIC ($\\sqrt(s)$=62 and 200 GeV) and from LHC\n($\\sqrt(s)$=0.9 and 7 TeV) have been considered. It is seen that the slope of\ndistributions at low $p_T$'s is changing with energy.

The preliminary\ndependence of hadron average transverse momenta on their masses at LHC energy\nis presented. The possible source of cosmic ray antiparticle-to-particle ratios\nthat are growing with energy was analyzed in the framework of QGSM, where the\ngrowing ratios are the result of local leading asymmetry between the production\nspectra of baryons and antibaryons in the kinematical region of proton target\nfragmentation. In the laboratory system of cosmic ray measurements this\nspectrum asymmetry will be seen as growing ratio of secondary\nantiparticle-to-particle spectra until the certain energy of secondaries.

The model consists of a fixed background and many small\n\"particles\" as building blocks that float around in the background to resemble\nthe target by clustering. This approach contrasts the conventional geometric\ninversions requiring the target to be regularly shaped bodies, since here the\ngeometry of the target can be arbitrary and does not need to be known\nbeforehand. Because of the lack of resolution in the data, the particles may\nnot necessarily cluster when recovering compact targets. A model norm, called\ndistribution norm, is introduced to quantify the spread of particles and\nincorporated into the objective function to encourage further clustering of the\nparticles. As proof of concept, 1D magnetotelluric inversion is used as\nexample. My experiments reveal that the particles, starting from a fully\nscattered distribution, are able to move towards the actual target location;\nthe quality of recovery depends on whether there is enough material (vertical\nconductance in 1D) in the particles to build the target; and the use of\ndistribution norm can help produce tightened clustering.
