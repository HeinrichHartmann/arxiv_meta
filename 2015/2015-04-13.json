Apart from rational integer bases (double-and-add algorithm),\nimaginary quadratic integer bases are of interest for elliptic curve\ncryptography, because the Frobenius endomorphism fulfils a quadratic equation.\nOne strategy for improving the efficiency is to increase the digit set (at the\nprize of additional precomputations). A common choice is the width\\nbd-$w$\nnon-adjacent form (\\wNAF): each block of $w$ consecutive digits contains at\nmost one non-zero digit.

Recently, it has been shown that emitters, such as fluorophores and\nnitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, can exhibit a strong nonradiative energy\ntransfer to graphene. So far, the energy of the transferred electronic\nexcitations has been considered to be lost within the electron bath of the\ngraphene. Here, we demonstrate that the trans-ferred excitations can be\nread-out by detecting corresponding currents with picosecond time resolution.\nWe electrically detect the spin of nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond\nelectronically and con-trol the nonradiative transfer to graphene by electron\nspin resonance. Our results open the avenue for incorporating nitrogen vacancy\ncenters as spin qubits into ultrafast electronic circuits and for harvesting\nnon-radiative transfer processes electronically.\n"]}]

Other references (e.g., [2,3])\nhave used simplified versions of the precoder to obtain promising performance\ngains. These gains have been hypothesized to stem from the additional degrees\nof freedom that allow for interference mitigation through interference\nrelegation to orthogonal subspaces. However, no conclusive or rigorous\nunderstanding has yet been developed. In this paper, we build on an intuitive\ninterference induction trade-off and the aforementioned precoding structure to\npropose an interference aware RZF (iaRZF) precoding scheme for multi cell\ndownlink systems and we analyze its rate performance. Special emphasis is\nplaced on the induced interference mitigation mechanism of iaRZF. For example,\nwe will verify the intuitive expectation that the precoder structure can either\ncompletely remove induced inter-cell or intra-cell interference. We state new\nresults from large-scale random matrix theory that make it possible to give\nmore intuitive and insightful explanations of the precoder behavior, also for\ncases involving imperfect channel state information (CSI). We remark especially\nthat the interference-aware precoder makes use of all available information\nabout interfering channels to improve performance. Even very poor CSI allows\nfor significant sum-rate gains.

Usually, non-Hermitian terms are added,\non a phenomenological basis, to such networks to summarize the effects of the\ncoupling to the sinks. Here we consider a paradigmatic model of open quantum\nnetwork for which we derive a non-Hermitian effective model, discussing its\nlimit of validity by a comparison with the analysis of the full Hermitian\nmodel. Specifically, we consider a ring of sites connected to a central\none-dimensional lead. The lead acts as a sink which absorbs the excitation\ninitially present in the ring. The coupling strength to the lead controls the\nopening of the ring system. This model has been widely discussed in literature\nin the context of light-harvesting systems. We analyze the effectiveness of the\nnon-Hermitian description both in absence and in presence of static disorder on\nthe ring. In both cases, the non-Hermitian model is valid when the energy range\ndetermined by the eigenvalues of the ring Hamiltonian is smaller than the\nenergy band in the lead. Under such condition, we show that results about the\ninterplay of opening and disorder, previously obtained within the non-Hermitian\nHamiltonian approach, remain valid when the full Hermitian model in presence of\ndisorder is considered. The results of our analysis can be extended to generic\nnetworks with sinks, leading to the conclusion that the non-Hermitian approach\nis valid when the energy dependence of the coupling to the external\nenvironments is sufficiently smooth in the energy range spanned by the\neigenstates of the network.\n","Comment: Final version, 20 pages, 15 figures"]}]

It combines the advantages of variational calculations\nand perturbation theory. The vibrational problem is solved by diagonalizing a\nHamiltonian matrix, which is partitioned into two sub-blocks. The first,\nsmaller sub-block includes matrix elements with the largest contribution to the\nenergy levels targeted in the calculations. The second, larger sub-block\ncomprises those basis states which have little effect on these energy levels.\nNumerical perturbation theory, implemented as a Jacobi rotation, is used to\ncompute the contributions from the matrix elements of the second sub-block.\nOnly the first sub-block needs to be stored in memory and diagonalized.\nCalculations of the vibrational-rotational energy levels also employ a\npartitioning of the Hamiltonian matrix into sub-blocks, each of which\ncorresponds either to a single vibrational state or a set of resonating\nvibrational states, with all associated rotational levels. Physically, this\npartitioning is efficient when the Coriolis coupling between different\nvibrational states is small. Numerical perturbation theory is used to include\nthe cross-contributions from different vibrational states. Separate individual\nsub-blocks are then diagonalized, replacing the diagonalization of a large\nHamiltonian matrix with a number of small matrix diagonalizations. Numerical\nexamples show that the proposed hybrid variational-perturbation method greatly\nspeeds up the variational procedure without significant loss of precision for\nboth vibrational-rotational energy levels and transition intensities.

The hallmark of entanglement is\nthe detection of strong correlations between systems, for example by the\nviolation of Bell's inequality. Using the CHSH variant of the Bell test, this\nviolation has been observed with photons, atoms, solid state spins, and\nartificial atoms in superconducting circuits. For larger, more distinguishable\nstates, the conflict between quantum predictions and our classical expectations\nis typically resolved due to the rapid onset of decoherence. To investigate\nthis reconciliation, one can employ a superposition of coherent states in an\noscillator, known as a cat state. In contrast to discrete systems, one can\ncontinuously vary the size of the prepared cat state and therefore its\ndependence on decoherence. Here we demonstrate and quantify entanglement\nbetween an artificial atom and a cat state in a cavity, which we call a\n`Bell-cat' state.

A number\nof clustering problems arise in machine learning where the optimal clusters do\nnot follow such a locality property. Consider a variant of the $k$-means\nproblem that may be regarded as a general version of such problems.

In particular, the special structures of turn-off and red clump\nparts cannot be generated by stellar rotation, but age spread perfectly\nreproduces the observed features.
