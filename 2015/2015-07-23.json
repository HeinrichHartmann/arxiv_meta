The moment map induces an\nembedding of the quotient of the manifold by the torus action into the dual of\nthe Lie algebra of the torus; its image is a unimodular (\"Delzant\") polytope;\nthis gives a bijection between unimodular polytopes and isomorphism classes of\ncompact connected symplectic toric manifolds. In this paper we extend Delzant's\nclassification to non-compact symplectic toric manifolds. For a non-compact\nsymplectic toric manifold the image of the moment map need not be convex and\nthe induced map on the quotient need not be an embedding. Moreover, even when\nthe map on the quotient is an embedding, its image no longer determines the\nsymplectic toric manifold; a degree two characteristic class on the quotient\nmakes an appearance. Nevertheless, the quotient is a manifold with corners, and\nthe induced map from the quotient to the dual of the Lie algebra is what we\ncall a unimodular local embedding. We classify non-compact symplectic toric\nmanifolds in terms of manifolds with corners equipped with degree two\ncohomology classes and unimodular local embeddings into the dual of the Lie\nalgebra of the corresponding torus. The main new ingredient is the construction\nof a symplectic toric manifold from such data. The proof passes through an\nequivalence of categories between symplectic toric manifolds and symplectic\ntoric bundles over a fixed unimodular local embedding. This equivalence also\ngives a geometric interpretation of the degree two cohomology class.\n"]}]

Since the amplitude information of sparse\nsignals in 1-bit CS is not available, it is often the support or the sign of a\nsignal that can be exactly recovered with a decoding method. In this paper, we\nfirst show that a necessary assumption (that has been overlooked in the\nliterature) should be made for some existing theories and discussions for 1-bit\nCS. Without such an assumption, the found solution by some existing decoding\nalgorithms might be inconsistent with 1-bit measurements. This motivates us to\npursue a new direction to develop uniform and nonuniform recovery theories for\n1-bit CS with a new decoding method which always generates a solution\nconsistent with 1-bit measurements. We focus on an extreme case of 1-bit CS, in\nwhich the measurements capture only the sign of the product of a sensing matrix\nand a signal. We show that the 1-bit CS model can be reformulated equivalently\nas an $\\ell_0$-minimization problem with linear constraints. This reformulation\nnaturally leads to a new linear-program-based decoding method, referred to as\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit, which is remarkably different from existing\nformulations. It turns out that the uniqueness condition for the solution of\nthe 1-bit basis pursuit yields the so-called restricted range space property\n(RRSP) of the transposed sensing matrix. This concept provides a basis to\ndevelop sign recovery conditions for sparse signals through 1-bit measurements.\nWe prove that if the sign of a sparse signal can be exactly recovered from\n1-bit measurements with 1-bit basis pursuit, then the sensing matrix must admit\na certain RRSP, and that if the sensing matrix admits a slightly enhanced RRSP,\nthen the sign of a $k$-sparse signal can be exactly recovered with 1-bit basis\npursuit.\n"]}]

Such a\ncorrespondence permits to naturally interpret QNMs as quantum levels in a\nsemi-classical model. This is a model of BH somewhat similar to the historical\nsemi-classical model of the structure of a hydrogen atom introduced by Bohr in\n1913. In a certain sense, QNMs represent the \"electron\" which jumps from a\nlevel to another one and the absolute values of the QNMs frequencies\n\"triggered\" by emissions (Hawking radiation) and absorption of particles\nrepresent the energy \"shells\" of the \"gravitational hydrogen atom\". Important\nconsequences on the BH information puzzle are discussed. In fact, it is shown\nthat the time evolution of this \"Bohr-like BH model\" obeys to a time dependent\nSchr\\\"odinger equation which permits the final BH state to be a pure quantum\nstate instead of a mixed one. Thus, information comes out in BH evaporation, in\nagreement with the assumption by 't Hooft that Schr\\\"oedinger equations can be\nused universally for all dynamics in the universe. We also show that, in\naddition, our approach solves the entanglement problem connected with the\ninformation paradox.

Large stop masses, required for a 125 GeV Higgs, feed into the\nelectroweak symmetry breaking conditions through renormalisation group\nequations forcing one to fine tune these parameters to obtain the correct\nelectroweak vacuum expectation value. Nonetheless this fine tuning depends\ncrucially on our assumptions about the supersymmetry breaking scale.

We find that viable bigravity models are subject to far\nless stringent constraints than massive gravity, where there is only one set of\n(massive) tensor modes. In principle sensitive to the effective graviton mass\nat the time of recombination, we find that in our setup the primordial tensor\nspectrum is more responsive to the dynamics of the massless tensor sector\nrather than its massive counterpart.

When\neither the source or target is at some distance from an infinite boundary, the\nnumber of degrees of freedom needed to resolve the scattering response is very\nmodest. When both are near an interface, however, the Sommerfeld integral\ninvolves a very large range of integration and its direct application becomes\nunwieldy.

Clustering ensemble has emerged as a potent\napproach for ameliorating both the forcefulness and the stability of\nunsupervised classification results. One of the major problems in clustering\nensembles is to find the best consensus function. Finding final partition from\ndifferent clustering results requires skillfulness and robustness of the\nclassification algorithm. In addition, the major problem with the consensus\nfunction is its sensitivity to the used data sets quality. This limitation is\ndue to the existence of noisy, silence or redundant data. This paper proposes a\nnovel consensus function of cluster ensembles based on Multilayer networks\ntechnique and a maintenance database method. This maintenance database approach\nis used in order to handle any given noisy speech and, thus, to guarantee the\nquality of databases. This can generates good results and efficient data\npartitions. To show its effectiveness, we support our strategy with empirical\nevaluation using distorted speech from Aurora speech databases.\n","Comment: 06 pages"]}]
