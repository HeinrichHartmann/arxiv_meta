The present article deals with\nthe case when the jump rates are affected by the locations of several particles\nin the system. Motivation for such models comes from non-attractive interacting\nparticle systems with particle conservation. Under suitable assumptions we\nestablish the existence of the process, and prove that the one-particle state\nis positive recurrent. We achieve this by arguments similar to those appeared\nin the previous article by Sturm and Swart. We also extend our results to some\ncases of long range jumps, when branching can also occur to non-neighboring\nsites. We outline and discuss several particular examples of models where our\nresults apply.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Then, we focus on the transverse (i.e., orthogonal to the mean\nmomentum) spin and orbital angular momenta, which were recently actively\ndiscussed in theory and observed in experiments. First, the recently-discovered\ntransverse spin angular momenta appear in various structured fields: evanescent\nwaves, interference fields, and focused beams. We show that there are several\nkinds of transverse spin angular momentum, which differ strongly in their\norigins and physical properties. We describe extraordinary features of the\ntransverse optical spins and overview recent experiments. In particular, the\nhelicity-independent transverse spin inherent in edge evanescent waves offers\nrobust spin-direction coupling at optical interfaces (the quantum spin Hall\neffect of light). Second, we overview the transverse orbital angular momenta of\nlight, which can be both extrinsic and intrinsic. These two types of the\ntransverse orbital angular momentum are produced by spatial shifts of the\noptical beams (e.g., in the spin Hall effect of light) and their Lorentz\nboosts, respectively. Our review is underpinned by a unified theory of the\nangular momentum of light based on the canonical momentum and spin densities,\nwhich avoids complications associated with the separation of spin and orbital\nangular momenta in the Poynting picture. It allows us to construct\ncomprehensive classification of all known optical angular momenta based on\ntheir key parameters and main physical properties.\n","Comment: 56 pages, 21 figures.

MapReduce based systems achieve massive scalability by partitioning\nthe data and running query tasks on those partitions in parallel. Therefore,\neffective data partitioning is critical for task parallelization, load\nbalancing, and directly affects system performance. However, several pitfalls\nof spatial data partitioning make this task particularly challenging. First,\ndata skew is very common in spatial applications. To achieve best query\nperformance, data skew need to be reduced. Second, spatial partitioning\napproaches generate boundary objects that cross multiple partitions, and add\nextra query processing overhead. Consequently, boundary objects need to be\nminimized. Third, the high computational complexity of spatial partitioning\nalgorithms combined with massive amounts of data require an efficient approach\nfor partitioning to achieve overall fast query response.

This applies in particular to the propagation of cosmic rays from\ntheir sources to Earth, responsible for energy suppressions due to pion\nphotoproduction by UHE protons (the Greisen-Zatsepin Kuzmin limit) and photo\ndisintegration of UHE nuclei (the Gerasimova-Rozental limit). A suppression in\nthe flux of UHECRs at energies above 40 EeV -- as expected from both these\ninteractions -- has been established experimentally beyond any doubt by current\nexperiments. However, such an observation is still not conclusive on the origin\nof the suppression. In particular, data from the Pierre Auger Observatory can\nbe interpreted in a scenario in which the suppression is due to the maximum\nacceleration energy at the sources rather than to interactions in the\nbackground radiation. In this scenario, UHECR data can no longer yield bounds\non Lorentz invariance violations which increase the thresholds for interactions\nof nuclei on background photons, in particular through modification of the\ndispersion relations.

Experimental\nresults further suggest that dynamics may be understood as long-timescale\ntransitions between multiple low-dimensional attractors. To identify\nmultistable regimes of our model, we develop a method for systematic generation\nof bifurcation diagrams and their analysis in an interpretable low-dimensional\nsubspace, showing the existence and nature of multistable input responses at a\nglance. Stimulation of the PLM neuron pair, experimentally associated with\nforward movement and shown in simulation to drive a limit cycle, defines our\nlow-dimensional projection space. We then obtain bifurcation diagrams for\nsingle-neuron excitation over a range of amplitudes and which classify whether\nthe dynamics in this projection space are associated with a limit cycle, fixed\npoint, or multiple states. In the specific case of compound input into both the\nPLM pair and ASK pair we discover bistability of a limit cycle and a fixed\npoint, with transitional timescales between different states being much longer\nthan other timescales in the system. This suggests consistency of our model\nwith the characterization of dynamics in neural systems as long-timescale\ntransitions between discrete, low-dimensional attractors corresponding to\nbehavioral states. Our methodology thus prescribes a method for identifying\nthese states and transitions in response to arbitrary input.\n","Comment: 8 Pages, 5 Figures"]}]

Joint photons can sample an\nobject collectively, resulting in faster phase accumulation and higher spatial\nresolution, while common components of noise can be subtracted. Even more, they\ncan accomplish this while physically separate, due to the nonlocal properties\nof quantum mechanics. Indeed, nearly all quantum optics experiments rely on\nthis separation, using individual point detectors that are scanned to measure\ncoincidence counts and correlations. Scanning, however, is tedious, time\nconsuming, and ill-suited for imaging. Moreover, the separation of beam paths\nadds complexity to the system while reducing the number of photons available\nfor sampling, and the multiplicity of detectors does not scale well for greater\nnumbers of photons and higher orders of entanglement. We bypass all of these\nproblems here by directly imaging collinear photon pairs with an\nelectron-multiplying CCD camera. We show explicitly the benefits of quantum\nnonlocality by engineering the spatial entanglement of the illuminating photons\nand introduce a new method of correlation measurement by converting time-domain\ncoincidence counting into spatial-domain detection of selected pixels. We show\nthat classical transport-of-intensity methods are applicable in the quantum\ndomain and experimentally demonstrate nearly optimal (Heisenberg-limited) phase\nmeasurement for the given quantum illumination.

It consists of four 12-m telescopes (CT1-4), which started operations\nin 2003, and a 28-m diameter one (CT5), which was brought online in 2012. It is\nthe only IACT system featuring telescopes of different sizes, which provides\nsensitivity for gamma rays across a very wide energy range, from ~30 GeV up to\n~100 TeV. Since the camera electronics of CT1-4 are much older than the one of\nCT5, an upgrade is being carried out; first deployment was in 2015, full\noperation is planned for 2016. The goals of this upgrade are threefold:\nreducing the dead time of the cameras, improving the overall performance of the\narray and reducing the system failure rate related to aging. Upon completion,\nthe upgrade will assure the continuous operation of H.E.S.S. at its full\nsensitivity until and possibly beyond the advent of CTA. In the design of the\nnew components, several CTA concepts and technologies were used and are thus\nbeing evaluated in the field: The upgraded read-out electronics is based on the\nNECTAR readout chips; the new camera front- and back-end control subsystems are\nbased on an FPGA and an embedded ARM computer; the communication between\nsubsystems is based on standard Ethernet technologies.
