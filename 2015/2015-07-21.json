We illustrate this\npoint using the minimal Higgs Inflationary scenario, which is arguably the most\npredictive single-field model on the market, because its predictions for $A_s$,\n$r$ and $n_s$ are made using only one new free parameter beyond those measured\nin particle physics experiments, and run up to the inflationary regime.

In events with high multiplicity, however, the\nstandard approach to tag boosted resonances by a large-radius fat jet becomes\ndifficult because the resonances are not well-separated from other hard\nradiation. In this paper, we propose a different approach to tag and\nreconstruct boosted resonances by using the recently proposed mass-jump jet\nalgorithm. A key feature of the algorithm is the flexible radius of the jets,\nwhich results from a terminating veto that prevents the recombination of two\nhard prongs if their combined jet mass is substantially larger than the masses\nof the separate prongs. The idea of collecting jets in \"buckets\" is also used.\nAs an example, we consider the fully hadronic final state of pair-produced\nvectorlike top partners at the LHC, $pp\\to T\\bar{T}\\to t\\bar{t}HH$, and show\nthat the new approach works better than the corresponding generalized $k_T$ jet\nclustering algorithm.

While these techniques often work well in practice, they do not\nprovide guarantees on the quality of the estimate. This paper shows that\nLagrangian duality is a powerful tool to assess the quality of a given\ncandidate solution. Our contribution is threefold. First, we discuss a revised\nformulation of the SLAM inference problem.

The second contribution is the derivation of\nthe corresponding Lagrangian dual problem. The SLAM dual problem is a (convex)\nsemidefinite program, which can be solved reliably and globally by\noff-the-shelf solvers.

We show that from the dual\nproblem, one can evaluate the quality (i.e., the suboptimality gap) of a\ncandidate SLAM solution, and ultimately provide a certificate of optimality.\nMoreover, when the duality gap is zero, one can compute a guaranteed optimal\nSLAM solution from the dual problem, circumventing non-convex optimization.

A central line of research is concerned with the\nidentification of classes of instances for which CSP can be solved in\npolynomial time; such classes are often called \"islands of tractability.\" A\nprominent way of defining islands of tractability for CSP is to restrict the\nrelations that may occur in the constraints to a fixed set, called a constraint\nlanguage, whereas a constraint language is conservative if it contains all\nunary relations. This paper addresses the general limit of the mentioned\ntractability results for CSP and #CSP, that they only apply to instances where\nall constraints belong to a single tractable language (in general, the union of\ntwo tractable languages isn't tractable). We show that we can overcome this\nlimitation as long as we keep some control of how constraints over the various\nconsidered tractable languages interact with each other. For this purpose we\nutilize the notion of a \\emph{strong backdoor} of a CSP instance, as introduced\nby Williams et al.

Our\nmain result is an algorithm that, given a CSP instance with $n$ variables,\nfinds in time $f(k)n^{O(1)}$ a strong backdoor into a scattered class\n(associated with a list of finite conservative constraint languages) of size\n$k$ or correctly decides that there isn't such a backdoor.\n"]}]

Degree four SoS does not recover the planted clique unless $\\omega \\gg\n\\sqrt n poly \\log n$, improving upon the bound $\\omega \\gg n^{1/3}$ due to DM.\nA similar result was obtained independently by Raghavendra and Schramm (2015).\n  2. For $2 < d = o(\\sqrt{\\log{(n)}})$, degree $2d$ SoS does not recover the\nplanted clique unless $\\omega \\gg n^{1/(d + 1)} /(2^d poly \\log n)$, improving\nupon the bound due to MPW.\n  Our proof for the second result is based on a fine spectral analysis of the\ncertificate used in the prior works MPW,DM and Feige and Krauthgamer (2003) by\ndecomposing it along an appropriately chosen basis. Along the way, we develop\ncombinatorial tools to analyze the spectrum of random matrices with dependent\nentries and to understand the symmetries in the eigenspaces of the set\nsymmetric matrices inspired by work of Grigoriev (2001).\n  An argument of Kelner shows that the first result cannot be proved using the\nsame certificate. Rather, our proof involves constructing and analyzing a new\ncertificate that yields the nearly tight lower bound by \"correcting\" the\ncertificate of previous works.\n","Comment: 67 pages, 2 figures"]}]

At each time slot the network controller activates a set of\nnon-interfering links and forwards selected copies of packets on each activated\nlink. A packet is considered jointly received only when all nodes in the\nnetwork have obtained a copy of it. The maximum rate of jointly received\npackets is referred to as the broadcast capacity of the network. Existing\npolicies achieve the broadcast capacity by balancing traffic over a set of\nspanning trees, which are difficult to maintain in a large and time-varying\nwireless network. We propose a new dynamic algorithm that achieves the\nbroadcast capacity when the underlying network topology is a directed acyclic\ngraph (DAG). This algorithm is decentralized, utilizes local queue-length\ninformation only and does not require the use of global topological structures\nsuch as spanning trees. The principal technical challenge inherent in the\nproblem is the absence of work-conservation principle due to the duplication of\npackets, which renders traditional queuing modelling inapplicable. We overcome\nthis difficulty by studying relative packet deficits and imposing in-order\ndelivery constraints to every node in the network. Although in-order packet\ndelivery, in general, leads to degraded throughput in graphs with cycles, we\nshow that it is throughput optimal in DAGs and can be exploited to simplify the\ndesign and analysis of optimal algorithms. Our characterization leads to a\npolynomial time algorithm for computing the broadcast capacity of any wireless\nDAG under the primary interference constraints. Additionally, we propose an\nextension of our algorithm which can be effectively used for broadcasting in\nany network with arbitrary topology.\n"]}]

Particularly, if we\nabandon the slow-roll condition for both the scalars we shall use, then the\nmost consistent description of the dynamics of the inflationary era is provided\nby the Hubble slow-roll parameters $\\epsilon_H$ and $\\eta_H$.

Among the various functional\ngroups, butyl is found to be the most effective in reducing the interfacial\nthermal resistance, followed by methyl, phenyl and formyl. The other functional\ngroups under consideration such as carboxyl, hydroxyl and amines are found to\nproduce negligible reduction in the interfacial thermal resistance. For\nmultilayer graphene with a layer number up to four, the interfacial thermal\nresistance is insensitive to the layer number. The effects of the different\nfunctional groups and the layer number on the interfacial thermal resistance\nare also elaborated using the vibrational density of states of the graphene and\nthe paraffin matrix. The present findings provide useful guidelines in the\napplication of functionalised graphene for practical thermal management.\n","Comment: 8 figures"]}]
