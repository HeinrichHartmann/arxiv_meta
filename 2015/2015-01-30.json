We extend these results to infinite-dimensional\nHilbert spaces of field theories and matrix models. We consider a quench setup,\nwhere initial states are chosen from a microcanonical ensemble of finite energy\nin free theory, and then evolve with an arbitrary non-perturbative Hamiltonian.\nGiven a dynamical assumption on the expectation value of particle number\ndensity, we prove that small subsystems reach equilibrium at the level of\nquantum wave-function, and with respect to all observables. The picture that\nemerges is that at higher energies, larger subsystems can reach equilibrium.\nFor bosonic fields on a lattice, in the limit of large number of bosons per\nsite, all subsystem smaller than half equilibrate. In the Hermitian matrix\nmodel, by contrast, this occurs in the limit of large energy per matrix\nelement, emphasizing the importance of the $O(N^2)$ energy scale for the fast\nscrambling conjecture. Applying our techniques to continuum field theories on\ncompact spaces, we show that the density matrix of small momentum-space\nobservables equilibrate. Finally, we discuss the connection with scrambling,\nand provide a sufficient condition for a time-independent Hamiltonian to be a\nscrambler in terms of the entanglement entropy of its energy eigenstates.\n"]}]

While the EOS is still poorly known, there are\nalso longstanding ambiguities in choosing General Relativity or alternative\ngravity theories in the not-so-well tested strong-field regime. Besides\npossible appearance of hyperons and new phases, the most uncertain part of the\nnucleonic EOS is currently the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy.\nTo provide information that may help break the EOS-gravity degeneracy, we\ninvestigate effects of symmetry energy within its uncertain range determined by\nterrestrial nuclear laboratory experiments on the gravitational binding energy\nand spacetime curvature of neutron stars within GR and the scalar-tensor (ST)\ntheory of gravity. In particular, we focus on effects of the following\nparameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter: (1) the\nincompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter, (2) the slope $L$ of\nsymmetry energy at saturation density and (3) the high-density behavior of\nsymmetry energy. We find that the variation of either the density slope $L$ or\nthe high-density behavior of symmetry energy leads to large changes in both the\nbinding energy and curvature of neutron stars while effects of varying the more\nconstrained $K_0$ are negligibly small. The difference in predictions using the\nGR and the ST theory appears only for massive neutron stars, and is\nsignificantly smaller than the differences resulting from variations in the\nsymmetry energy.

However, a challenging\nsecrecy communication issue arises as the messages sent to the information\nreceivers (IRs) may be eavesdropped by the energy receivers (ERs), which are\npresumed to harvest energy only from the received signals. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose in this paper an artificial noise (AN) aided transmission\nscheme to facilitate the secrecy information transmission to IRs and yet meet\nthe energy harvesting requirement for ERs, under the assumption that the AN can\nbe cancelled at IRs but not at ERs. Specifically, the proposed scheme splits\nthe transmit power into two parts, to send the confidential message to the IR\nand an AN to interfere with the ER, respectively. Under a simplified three-node\nwiretap channel setup, the transmit power allocations and power splitting\nratios over fading channels are jointly optimized to minimize the outage\nprobability for delay-limited secrecy information transmission, or to maximize\nthe average rate for no-delay-limited secrecy information transmission, subject\nto a combination of average and peak power constraints at the transmitter as\nwell as an average energy harvesting constraint at the ER.

This competition can lead to many types of\nmagnetic order in metals. For example, in chromium the electrons order to form\na spin-density-wave (SDW) antiferromagnetic state. A magnetic field may be used\nto perturb or tune materials with delicately balanced electronic interactions.\nHere we show that the application of a magnetic field can induce SDW magnetic\norder in a metal, where none exists in the absence of the field. We use\nmagnetic neutron scattering to show that the application of a large (~8T)\nmagnetic field to the metamagnetic perovskite metal Sr3Ru2O7 can be used to\ntune the material through two magnetically-ordered SDW states. The ordered\nstates exist over relatively small ranges in field (<0.4T) suggesting that\ntheir origin is due to a new mechanism related to the electronic fine structure\nnear the Fermi energy, possibly combined with the stabilising effect of\nmagnetic fluctuations. The magnetic field direction is shown to control the SDW\ndomain populations which naturally explains the strong resistivity anisotropy\nor electronic nematic behaviour observed in this material.\n","Comment: Legend in Fig. 3(b) corrected"]}]

When the\nbow shocks intersect at or above a certain critical angle, a planar shock\ncalled a Mach stem is formed. These shocks could produce brighter H$\\alpha$\nemission since the incoming flow to the Mach stem is parallel to the shock\nnormal. In this paper we report first results of a study using 2-D numerical\nsimulations designed to explore Mach stem formation at the intersection of bow\nshocks formed by hypersonic \"bullets\" or \"clumps\". Our 2-D simulations show how\nthe bow shock shapes and intersection angles change as the adiabatic index\n$\\gamma$ changes. We show that the formation or lack of a Mach stem in our\nsimulations is consistent with the steady-state Mach stem formation theory. Our\nultimate goal, which is part of an ongoing research effort, is to characterize\nthe physical and observational consequences of bow shock intersections\nincluding the formation of Mach stems.\n"]}]

To this end, we use SU(3) Polyakov linear sigma-model and assume that\nthe external magnetic field eB adds some restrictions to the quarks energy due\nto the existence of free charges in the plasma phase.

Based on this, we\nhave studied the thermal evolution of thermodynamic quantities and the first\nfour higher-order moment of particle multiplicity. Having all these\ncalculations, we have studied the effects of magnetic field on chiral\nphase-transition.

At low T, the scalar\nmeson masses normalized to the lowest Matsubara frequency rapidly decreases as\nT increases. Then, starting from T_c, we find that the thermal dependence\nalmost vanishes. Furthermore, the meson masses increase with increasing\nmagnetic field. This gives characteristic phase diagram of T vs. external\nmagnetic field $B.

In this study, UAV dynamics are described by a three-dimensional\ndynamic point-mass model. A stochastic wind field model has been used to\nanalyze the effect of the wind in the process. Onboard closed-loop trajectory\ntracking logics that follow airspeed vector commands are modeled using the\nmethod of feedback linearization. To evaluate the benefits of these strategies\nin enhancing UAV flight endurance, a reference strategy is introduced in which\nthe UAV would follow the optimal airspeed command in a steady level flight\nunder zero wind conditions. A performance measure is defined as the average\npower consumption with respect to no wind case. Different scenarios have been\nevaluated both over a specified time interval and over different initial\nheading angles of the UAV.
