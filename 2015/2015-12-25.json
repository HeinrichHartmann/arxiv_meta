Classical examples include linear\nand non-linear approximations, sparse representations, and rate-distortion\ntheory. Very often, however, the goal of processing is to extract specific\ninformation from the signal, and the distortion should be measured on the\nextracted information. The corresponding representation should, therefore,\nrepresent that information as parsimoniously as possible, without necessarily\naccurately representing the signal itself.\n  In this paper, we examine the problem of encoding signals such that\nsufficient information is preserved about their pairwise distances and their\ninner products. For that goal, we consider randomized embeddings as an encoding\nmechanism and provide a framework to analyze their performance. We also\ndemonstrate that it is possible to design the embedding such that it represents\ndifferent ranges of distances with different precision. These embeddings also\nallow the computation of kernel inner products with control on their inner\nproduct-preserving properties.

CCN eschews source addresses and creates\none-time virtual circuits for every content request (called an interest). As an\ninterest is forwarded it creates state in intervening routers and the requested\ncontent back is delivered over the reverse path using that state.\n  Although a stateful forwarding plane might be beneficial in terms of\nefficiency, and resilience to certain types of attacks, this has not been\ndecisively proven via realistic experiments. Since keeping per-interest state\ncomplicates router operations and makes the infrastructure susceptible to\nrouter state exhaustion attacks (e.g., there is currently no effective defense\nagainst interest flooding attacks), the value of the stateful forwarding plane\nin CCN should be re-examined.\n  In this paper, we explore supposed benefits and various problems of the\nstateful forwarding plane.

As a result, we show that optimizing the memory size carries\nat most a small cost in terms of time, in the context of Minimum Spanning Tree\n(MST). That is, we present algorithms that are both time and space efficient\nfor both constructing an MST and for verifying it.This involves several parts\nthat may be considered contributions in themselves.First, we generalize the\nnotion of local proofs, trading off the time complexity for memory efficiency.\nThis adds a dimension to the study of distributed local proofs, which has been\ngaining attention recently. Specifically, we design a (self-stabilizing) proof\nlabeling scheme which is memory optimal (i.e., $O(\\log n)$ bits per node), and\nwhose time complexity is $O(\\log ^2 n)$ in synchronous networks, or $O(\\Delta\n\\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of\nnodes. This answers an open problem posed by Awerbuch and Varghese (FOCS 1991).\nWe also show that $\\Omega(\\log n)$ time is necessary, even in synchronous\nnetworks. Another property is that if $f$ faults occurred, then, within the\nrequireddetection time above, they are detected by some node in the $O(f\\log\nn)$ locality of each of the faults.Second, we show how to enhance a known\ntransformer that makes input/output algorithms self-stabilizing. It now takes\nas input an efficient construction algorithm and an efficient self-stabilizing\nproof labeling scheme, and produces an efficient self-stabilizing algorithm.\nWhen used for MST, the transformer produces a memory optimal self-stabilizing\nalgorithm, whose time complexity, namely, $O(n)$, is significantly better even\nthan that of previous algorithms. (The time complexity of previous MST\nalgorithms that used $\\Omega(\\log^2 n)$ memory bits per node was $O(n^2)$, and\nthe time for optimal space algorithms was $O(n|E|)$.) Inherited from our proof\nlabelling scheme, our self-stabilising MST construction algorithm also has the\nfollowing two properties: (1) if faults occur after the construction ended,\nthen they are detected by some nodes within $O(\\log ^2 n)$ time in synchronous\nnetworks, or within $O(\\Delta \\log ^3 n)$ time in asynchronous ones, and (2) if\n$f$ faults occurred, then, within the required detection time above, they are\ndetected within the $O(f\\log n)$ locality of each of the faults.

Currently, there are two main\ndesign paradigms for RDMA-accelerated systems. The first allows the clients to\ndirectly operate the server's memory and totally bypasses the CPUs at server\nside. The second follows the traditional server-reply paradigm, which asks the\nserver to write results back to the clients. However, the first method has to\nexpose server's memory and needs tremendous re-design of upper-layer software,\nwhich is complex, unsafe, error-prone, and inefficient.

We find that controversy decreases\nwith popularity and that hard controversy is relatively rare. Our findings also\nsuggest that more recent movies are more controversial than older ones and we\ndetect a trend of \"convergence to the mainstream\" with a time scale of roughly\n40-50 years. This phenomenon appears qualitatively different from trends\nobserved in both online reviews of commercial products and in political debate,\nand we speculate that it may be connected with the absence of long-lived \"echo\nchambers\" in the cultural domain.
