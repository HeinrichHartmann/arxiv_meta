Of special interest is the analysis of the exchange of light\nsignals between the travelling and stay-at-home twins in Langevin's thought\nexperiment, in which antinomies are found in the conventional relativistic\ntreatment. Their resolution shows that the physical basis of the differential\naging effect in the experiment is not `length contraction', as in the\nconventional interpretation, but instead the application of the correct\nrelative velocity transformation formula. The spurious nature of the correlated\n`length contraction' and `relativity of simultaneity' effects of conventional\nspecial relativity is also demonstrated. In consequence, an argument given,\nclaiming to demonstrate that an upper limit of $c$ on the speed of any physical\nsignal is required by causality, is invalid. Its conclusion is also in\ncontradiction with astronomical observations and the results of a recent\nexperiment.\n","Comment: 55 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, V2 typos removed, text improved, refs.\n  updated, conclusions unchanged"]}]

We model these interactions using qualitative\ninsights from holographic calculations of the energy loss of energetic light\nquarks and gluons in a strongly coupled plasma, obtained via gauge/gravity\nduality. We embed this hybrid model into a hydrodynamic description of the\nspacetime evolution of the hot QCD matter produced in heavy ion collisions and\nconfront its predictions with jet data from the LHC. The holographic expression\nfor the energy loss of a light quark or gluon that we incorporate in our hybrid\nmodel is parametrized by a stopping distance. We find very good agreement with\nall the data as long as we choose a stopping distance that is comparable to but\nsomewhat longer than that in ${\\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. For\ncomparison, we also construct alternative models in which energy loss occurs as\nit would if the plasma were weakly coupled.

One is a double spin-chain\nformulation of the spin-chain and the associated new interpretation of the\noperation of Wick contraction. It will be regarded as a skew symmetric pairing\nwhich acts as a projection onto a singlet in the entire SO(4) sector, instead\nof an inner product in the spin-chain Hilbert space. This formalism allows us\nto study a class of three-point functions of operators built upon more general\nspin-chain vacua than the special configuration discussed so far in the\nliterature. Furthermore, this new viewpoint has the signicant advantage over\nthe conventional method: In the usual \"tailoring\" operation, the Wick\ncontraction produces inner products between off-shell Bethe states, which\ncannot be in general converted into simple expressions. In contrast, our\nprocedure directly produces the so-called partial domain wall partition\nfunctions, which can be expressed as determinants. Using this property, we\nderive simple determinantal representation for a broader class of three-point\nfunctions. The second new property uncovered in this work is the non-trivial\nidentity satisfied by the three-point functions with monodromy operators\ninserted. Generically this relation connects three-point functions of different\noperators and can be regarded as a kind of Schwinger-Dyson equation. In\nparticular, this identity reduces in the semiclassical limit to the triviality\nof the product of local monodromies around the vertex operators, which played a\ncrucial role in providing all important global information on the three-point\nfunction in the strong coupling regime. This structure may provide a key to the\nunderstanding of the notion of \"integrability\" beyond the spectral level.\n","Comment: 35 pages;v2 Minor corrections made.

The LIRG Zw 049.057 contains a compact obscured nucleus where a\nconsiderable amount of the galaxy's luminosity is generated. This nucleus\ncontains a dusty environment that is rich in molecular gas. One approach to\nprobing this kind of environment and to revealing what is hidden behind the\ndust is to study the rotational lines of molecules that couple well with the IR\nradiation emitted by the dust. Methods. We observed Zw 049.057 with PACS and\nSPIRE onboard the Herschel Space Observatory in rotational lines of H2O, H218O,\nOH, 18OH, and [O I]. We modeled the unresolved core of the galaxy using a\nspherically symmetric radiative transfer code. Results. We present the full\nSPIRE FTS spectrum of Zw 049.057, along with relevant spectral scans in the\nPACS range. We find that a minimum of two different components (nuclear and\nextended) are required in order to account for the rich molecular line\nspectrum. The nuclear component has a radius of 10-30 pc, a very high infrared\nsurface brightness (1e14 Lsun/kpc2), warm dust (Td > 100 K), and a very large\nH2 column density (NH2 = 1e24-1e25 cm-2).

The Sun is an active source of radio emission that is often\nassociated with energetic phenomena ranging from nanoflares to coronal mass\nejections (CMEs). At low radio frequencies (<100 MHz), numerous millisecond\nduration radio bursts have been reported, such as radio spikes or solar S\nbursts (where S stands for short). To date, these have neither been studied\nextensively nor imaged because of the instrumental limitations of previous\nradio telescopes. Aims. Here, Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) observations were\nused to study the spectral and spatial characteristics of a multitude of S\nbursts, as well as their origin and possible emission mechanisms. Methods. We\nused 170 simultaneous tied-array beams for spectroscopy and imaging of S\nbursts. Since S bursts have short timescales and fine frequency structures,\nhigh cadence (~50 ms) tied-array images were used instead of standard\ninterferometric imaging, that is currently limited to one image per second.\nResults. On 9 July 2013, over 3000 S bursts were observed over a time period of\n~8 hours. S bursts were found to appear as groups of short-lived (<1 s) and\nnarrow-bandwidth (~2.5 MHz) features, the majority drifting at ~3.5 MHz/s and a\nwide range of circular polarisation degrees (2-8 times more polarised than the\naccompanying Type III bursts). Extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field\nusing the potential field source surface (PFSS) model suggests that S bursts\nare associated with a trans-equatorial loop system that connects an active\nregion in the southern hemisphere to a bipolar region of plage in the northern\nhemisphere. Conclusions. We have identified polarised, short-lived solar radio\nbursts that have never been imaged before. They are observed at a height and\nfrequency range where plasma emission is the dominant emission mechanism,\nhowever they possess some of the characteristics of electron-cyclotron maser\nemission.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Some practically important properties include (a)\neED and gMMD have asymptotically equal power; furthermore they enjoy a free\nlunch because, while they are additionally consistent for GDA, they also have\nthe same power as specialized high-dimensional t-test variants for MDA. All\nthese tests are asymptotically optimal (including matching constants) under MDA\nfor spherical covariances, according to simple lower bounds, (b) The power of\ngMMD is independent of the kernel bandwidth, as long as it is larger than the\nchoice made by the median heuristic, (c) There is a clear and smooth\ncomputation-statistics tradeoff for linear-time, subquadratic-time and\nquadratic-time versions of these tests, with more computation resulting in\nhigher power.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 4 figures"]}]

These observations provide empirical support\nto a computational particle model of group hunting which was previously shown\nto be effective in explaining why hunting success peaks at apparently small\npack sizes when hunting elk. The model is based on considering two critical\ndistances between wolves and prey: the minimal safe distance at which wolves\nstand from the prey, and the avoidance distance at which wolves move away from\neach other when they approach the prey. The minimal safe distance is longer\nwhen the prey is more dangerous to hunt. We show that the model explains\neffectively that the group size threshold is greater when the minimal safe\ndistance is longer. Although both distances are longer when the prey is more\ndangerous, they contribute oppositely to the value of the group size threshold:\nthe group size threshold is smaller when the avoidance distance is longer. This\nunexpected mechanism gives rise to a global increase of the group size\nthreshold when considering bison with respect to elk, but other prey more\ndangerous than elk can lead to specific critical distances that can give rise\nto the same group size threshold. Our results show that the computational model\ncan guide further research on group size effects, suggesting that more\nexperimental observations should be obtained for other kind of prey as e.g.\nmoose.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 4 figures, 8 references.
