In over-damped soft matter systems, such behavior is\na hallmark of the presence of a sustained external driving force accompanied\nwith dissipations. In an under-damped and strongly correlated system, however,\ncyclic motions are often the consequences of a conservative dynamics. In the\npresent paper, we give a novel interpretation of a class of diffusion processes\nwith stationary circulation in terms of a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium in\nwhich cyclic motions are on the level set of stationary probability density\nfunction thus non-dissipative, e.g., a supercurrent. This implies an\northogonality between stationary circulation $J^{ss}(x)$ and the gradient of\nstationary probability density $f^{ss}(x)>0$.

In March 2012, the most significant neutrino alert\nduring the first three years of operation was issued by IceCube. In the\nfollow-up observations performed by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), a Type\nIIn supernova (SN) PTF12csy was found $0.2^\\circ$ away from the neutrino alert\ndirection, with an error radius of $0.54^\\circ$. It has a redshift of\n$z=0.0684$, corresponding to a luminosity distance of about $300 \\,\n\\mathrm{Mpc}$ and the Pan-STARRS1 survey shows that its explosion time was at\nleast 158 days (in host galaxy rest frame) before the neutrino alert, so that a\ncausal connection is unlikely.

Also, a complementary\nneutrino analysis reveals no long-term signal over the course of one year.\nTherefore, we consider the SN detection coincidental and the neutrinos\nuncorrelated to the SN. However, the SN is unusual and interesting by itself:\nIt is luminous and energetic, bearing strong resemblance to the SN IIn 2010jl,\nand shows signs of interaction of the SN ejecta with a dense circumstellar\nmedium. High-energy neutrino emission is expected in models of diffusive shock\nacceleration, but at a low, non-detectable level for this specific SN.

When models are realistic and are stepped through thousands\nof machine cycles, these terms can grow quite large and the cost of simplifying\nthem on each step grows. In this paper we describe an ACL2 book that uses HIDE\nand metafunctions to facilitate the management of large terms representing such\nstates. Because the metafunctions for each state component updater are solely\nresponsible for creating state expressions (i.e., \"writing\") and the\nmetafunctions for each state component accessor are solely responsible for\nextracting values (i.e., \"reading\") from such state expressions, they can\nmaintain their own normal form, use HIDE to prevent other parts of ACL2 from\ninspecting them, and use honsing to uniquely represent state expressions. The\nlast feature makes it possible to memoize the metafunctions, which can improve\nproof performance in some machine models. This paper describes a\ngeneral-purpose ACL2 book modeling a byte-addressed memory supporting \"mixed\"\nreads and writes. By \"mixed\" we mean that reads need not correspond (in address\nor number of bytes) with writes. Verified metafunctions simplify such\n\"read-over-write\" expressions while hiding the potentially large state\nexpression.

First, whether duals are physically equivalent or\nnot: by considering a duality of the familiar simple harmonic oscillator, I\nargue that they are. Unlike the oscillator, there are no measurements 'outside'\nstring theory that could distinguish the duals. Second, whether duals agree or\ndisagree on the radius of 'target space', the space in which strings evolve\naccording to string theory. I argue for the latter position, because the\nalternative leaves it unknown what the radius is. Since duals are physically\nequivalent yet disagree on the radius of target space, it follows that the\nradius is indeterminate between them. Using an analysis of Brandenberger and\nVafa (1989), I explain why -- even so -- space is observed to have a\ndeterminate, large radius.

The initial estimate is made using a Bayesian compressive\nsensing (BCS) framework and then tracked using a Bayesian compressed sensing\nKalman filter (BCSKF). The BCS framework splits the angular region into N\npotential DOAs and enforces a belief that only a few of the DOAs will have a\nnon-zero valued signal present. A BCSKF can then be used to track the change in\nthe DOA using the same framework. There can be an issue when the DOA approaches\nthe endfire of the array. In this angular region current methods can struggle\nto accurately estimate and track changes in the DOAs. To tackle this problem,\nwe propose changing the traditional sparse belief associated with BCS to a\nbelief that the estimated signals will match the predicted signals given a\nknown DOA change. This is done by modelling the difference between the expected\nsparse received signals and the estimated sparse received signals as a Gaussian\ndistribution.

Given a set of\nnodes of interest, uniquely localizing failures within this set requires that\ndifferent observable path states associate with different node failure events.\nHowever, this condition is difficult to test on large networks due to the need\nto enumerate all possible node failures. Our first contribution is a set of\nsufficient/necessary conditions for identifying a bounded number of failures\nwithin an arbitrary node set that can be tested in polynomial time. In addition\nto network topology and locations of monitors, our conditions also incorporate\nconstraints imposed by the probing mechanism used. We consider three probing\nmechanisms that differ according to whether measurement paths are (i)\narbitrarily controllable, (ii) controllable but cycle-free, or (iii)\nuncontrollable (determined by the default routing protocol). Our second\ncontribution is to quantify the capability of failure localization through (1)\nthe maximum number of failures (anywhere in the network) such that failures\nwithin a given node set can be uniquely localized, and (2) the largest node set\nwithin which failures can be uniquely localized under a given bound on the\ntotal number of failures. Both measures in (1-2) can be converted into\nfunctions of a per-node property, which can be computed efficiently based on\nthe above sufficient/necessary conditions.

Such measures are called\ntransport plans. An optimal transport plan is a plan that maximizes the\nintegral of a certain potential function.

Gibbs plan can converge, under certain\nconditions, to optimal plans (zero-temperature limit).
