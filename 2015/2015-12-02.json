In this\ncontribution, we study the stability and dynamics of a two-stage gene\nexpression switch within a probabilistic framework inspired by the properties\nof the Pu/Gata toggle switch in myeloid progenitor cells. We focus on low mRNA\nnumbers, high protein abundance and monomeric transcription factor binding.\nContrary to the expectation from a deterministic description, this switch shows\ncomplex multi-attractor dy- namics without autoactivation and cooperativity.\nMost importantly, the four attractors of the system, which only emerge in a\nprobabilistic two-stage description, can be identified with committed and\nprimed states in cell differentiation. We first study the dynamics of the\nsystem and infer the mechanisms that move the system between attractors using\nboth the quasi-potential and the probability flux of the system. Second, we\nshow that the residence times of the system in one of the committed attractors\nare geometrically distributed and provide an analytical expression of the\ndistribution. Most importantly we find that the mean residence time increases\nlinearly with the mean protein level. Finally, we study the implications of\nthis distribution for the stability of a switch and discuss the influence of\nthe stability on a specific cell differentiation mechanism.

However, suspensions composed of uniformly sized particles also\ndevelop a granular front. Within a large rotating drum, a stationary\nrecirculating avalanche is generated. The flowing material is a mixture of a\nvisco-plastic fluid obtained from a kaolin-water dispersion, with spherical\nceramic particles denser than the fluid. The goal is to mimic the composition\nof many common granular-fluid materials, like fresh concrete or debris flow. In\nthese materials, granular and fluid phases have the natural tendency to\nsegregate due to particle settling. However, through the shearing caused by the\nrotation of the drum, a reorganization of the phases is induced, leading to the\nformation of a granular front.

The setting is reproduced\nin a numerical environment, where the fluid is solved by a Lattice-Boltzmann\nMethod, and the particles are explicitly represented using the Discrete Element\nMethod.

Previous work indicates\nthat large values of $Q$ lead to galaxies so dense that planetary orbits cannot\nsurvive long enough for life to develop. Small values of $Q$ lead to delayed\nstar formation, loosely bound galaxies, and compromised heavy element\nretention. This work generalizes previous treatments: [A] We consider models\nfor the internal structure of galaxies and find the fraction of galactic real\nestate that allows stable, long-lived planetary orbits. [B] We perform a large\nensemble of numerical simulations to estimate cross sections for the disruption\nof planetary orbits due to interactions with passing stars. [C] We consider\ndisruption due to the background radiation fields produced by the galaxies. [D]\nOne consequence of intense galactic background radiation fields is that some\nportion of the galaxy, denoted as the Galactic Habitable Zone, will provide the\nright flux levels to support habitable planets for essentially any planetary\norbit. As $Q$ increases, the fraction of stars in a galaxy that allow for\nhabitable planets decreases due to both orbital disruption and the intense\nbackground radiation. However, the outer parts of the galaxy always allow for\nhabitable planets, so that the value of $Q$ does not have a well-defined upper\nlimit. Moreover, some Galactic Habitable Zones are large enough to support more\npotentially habitable planets than the galaxies found in our universe. These\nresults suggest that the possibilities for habitability in other universes are\nsomewhat more favorable and far more diverse than previously imagined.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures; version includes responses to two referees;\n  accepted to JCAP"]}]

The core mass function (CMF) derived for the prestellar\ncores is very similar in shape to the stellar initial mass function (IMF),\nsupporting the earlier view that there is a close physical link between the IMF\nand the CMF. The global shift in mass scale observed between the CMF and the\nIMF is consistent with a typical star formation efficiency of ~40%. By\ncomparing the numbers of starless cores to the number of young stellar objects,\nwe estimate that the lifetime of prestellar cores is ~1 Myr. We find a strong\ncorrelation between the spatial distribution of prestellar cores and the\ndensest filaments. About 90% of the Herschel-identified prestellar cores are\nlocated above a background column density corresponding to A_V~7, and ~75% of\nthem lie within filamentary structures with supercritical masses per unit\nlength >~16 M_sun/pc.

We transform $f(R)$ gravity from the Jordan frame into\nthe Einstein frame and simulate scalar collapses in flat, Schwarzschild, and\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om geometries. In simulating scalar collapses in\nSchwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om geometries, Kruskal and Kruskal-like\ncoordinates are used, respectively, with the presence of $f'$ and a physical\nscalar field being taken into account. The dynamics in the vicinities of the\ncentral singularity of a Schwarzschild black hole and of the inner horizon of a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole is examined. Approximate analytic solutions for\ndifferent types of collapses are partially obtained. The scalar degree of\nfreedom $\\phi$, transformed from $f'$, plays a similar role as a physical\nscalar field in general relativity. Regarding the physical scalar field in\n$f(R)$ case, when $d\\phi/dt$ is negative (positive), the physical scalar field\nis suppressed (magnified) by $\\phi$, where $t$ is the coordinate time. For dark\nenergy $f(R)$ gravity, inside black holes, gravity can easily push $f'$ to $1$.\nConsequently, the Ricci scalar $R$ becomes singular, and the numerical\nsimulation breaks down. This singularity problem can be avoided by adding an\n$R^2$ term to the original $f(R)$ function, in which case an infinite Ricci\nscalar is pushed to regions where $f'$ is also infinite. On the other hand, in\ncollapse for this combined model, a black hole, including a central\nsingularity, can be formed. Moreover, under certain initial conditions, $f'$\nand $R$ can be pushed to infinity as the central singularity is approached.\nTherefore, the classical singularity problem, which is present in general\nrelativity, remains in collapse for this combined model.\n","Comment: 35 pages, 22 figures.

It rises\nwithin (83-148)days (rest-frame) to reach a peak bolometric luminosity of\n1.3x$10^{44}$erg/s, then decays very slowly at 0.015mag. per day. The measured\nejecta velocity is 13000km/s. The inferred explosion characteristics, such as\nthe ejecta mass (67-220$M_\\odot$), the total radiative and kinetic energy\n($10^{51}$ & 2x$10^{53}$erg respectively), is typical of a slow-evolving H-poor\nSLSN event. However, the late-time spectrum taken at +251days reveals a Balmer\nHalpha emission feature with broad and narrow components, which has never been\ndetected before among other H-poor SLSNe.

We therefore construct a time-independent SHMR model for central\ngalaxies, wherein the in-situ star formation rate (SFR) is determined by the\nhalo mass accretion rate (MAR), which we call Stellar-Halo Accretion Rate\nCoevolution (SHARC). We show that the $\\sim0.3$ dex dispersion of the halo MAR\nmatches the observed dispersion of the SFR on the star-formation main sequence\n(MS). In the context of \"bathtub\"-type models of galaxy formation, SHARC leads\nto mass-dependent constraints on the relation between SFR and MAR. Despite its\nsimplicity and the simplified treatment of mass growth from mergers, the SHARC\nmodel is likely to be a good approximation for central galaxies with $M_*=10^9-\n10^{10.5}M_\\odot$ that are on the MS, representing most of the star formation\nin the Universe. SHARC predictions agree with observed SFRs for galaxies on the\nMS at low redshifts, agree fairly well at $z\\sim4$, but exceed observations at\n$z>4$. Assuming that the interstellar gas mass is constant for each galaxy (the\n\"equilibrium condition\" in bathtub models), the SHARC model allows calculation\nof net mass loading factors for inflowing and outflowing gas. With assumptions\nabout preventive feedback based on simulations, SHARC allows calculation of\ngalaxy metallicity evolution. If galaxy SFRs indeed track halo MARs, especially\nat low redshifts, that may help explain the success of models linking galaxy\nproperties to halos (including age-matching) and the similarities between\ntwo-halo galaxy conformity and halo mass accretion conformity.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS.

Here we report that much -- or potentially all -- of the\nobserved excess likely arises from residual spatial variations in temperature\nthat are an inevitable byproduct of a patchy and extended reionization process.\nThe amplitude of opacity fluctuations generated in this way depends on the\ntiming and duration of reionization. If the entire excess is due to temperature\nvariations alone, the observed fluctuation amplitude favors a late-ending but\nextended reionization process that was roughly half complete by z~9 and that\nended at z~6. In this scenario, the highest opacities occur in regions that\nreionized earliest, since they have had the most time to cool, while the lowest\nopacities occur in the warmer regions that reionized most recently.

The spectral fit of the four components is consistent\nwith a scenario in which the outer lobes are still active or the jets recently\nswitched off, while emission of the inner lobes is the result of a mix-up of\nnew and old jet activity. From the presence of the newly extended features in\nthe inner lobes of the DDRG, we can infer that the mechanism responsible for\ntheir formation is the bow shock that is driven by the newly launched jet.

We probe AGN optical variability for a large\nsample of X-ray-selected AGNs in the XMM-COSMOS field, using the light curves\nprovided by the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) 3pi and MDF04 surveys.

We find that M dwarf stars have 3.5 times more small planets\n(1.0-2.8 R_Earth) than main-sequence FGK stars, but two times fewer\nNeptune-sized and larger planets (>2.8 R_Earth).

The overall higher planet occurrence\nrates around M stars are not consistent with the redistribution of the same\nmass into more, smaller planets. At the orbital periods and planet radii where\nKepler observations are complete for all spectral types, the average\nheavy-element mass locked up in exoplanets increases roughly inversely with\nstellar mass from 4 M_Earth in F stars to 5 M_Earth in G and K stars to 7\nM_Earth in M stars.

Recently, Deason et al.

Here we demonstrate, however, that this\nresult is seriously biased by not taking into detailed consideration on the\nformation mechanism of BHB stars from helium enhanced second-generation\npopulation. In particular, the high BS-to-BHB ratio observed in the outer halo\nfields is most likely due to a small number of BHB stars provided by GCs rather\nthan to a large number of BS stars. This is supported by our dynamical\nevolution model of GCs which shows preferential removal of first generation\nstars in GCs. Moreover, there are a sufficient number of outer halo GCs which\nshow very high BS-to-BHB ratio. Therefore, the BS-to-BHB number ratio is not a\ngood indicator to use in arguing that more massive dwarf galaxies are the main\nbuilding blocks of the Milky Way outer halo.

However,\nowing to the physical extension of the observing beam, observations may detect\nscattered photons, resulting in a change in the observed (or effective)\nextinction, depending on the spatial distribution of the dust and the\nresolution of the instrument. We investigate the influence of clumpy dust\ndistributions on effective extinction toward embedded sources and those in the\ndiffuse ISM. We use Monte Carlo radiative transfer to examine effective\nextinction for various geometries. By varying the number, optical depth and\nvolume-filling factor of clumps in models of spherical shells and the diffuse\nISM, we explore the evolution of extinction. Depending on the number of\nscattering events in the beam, the extinction curve steepens in homogeneous\nmedia and flattens in clumpy media. As a result, clumpy dust distributions can\nto reproduce extinction curves with arbitrary R_v, the effective ratio of\ntotal-to-selective extinction. The flattening `washes out' the 2175 \\AA bump\nand shifts the peak to shorter wavelengths. The mean R_v of a shell correlates\nwith the optical depth of an individual clump and the wavelength at which a\nclump becomes optically thick. Similar behaviour is seen for edge-on discs or\ntori. However, at grazing inclinations the combination of extinction and strong\nforward scattering results in chaotic behaviour. Caution is therefore advised\nwhen measuring extinction in, for example, AGN tori or toward SNIa or GRB\nafterglows. In face-on discs, the shape of the scattered continuum changes with\nclumpiness, however, unlike absorption features, individual features in the\nscattering cross-sections are preserved.

Photometric monitoring of the variability of brown dwarfs can\nprovide useful information about the structure of clouds in their cold\natmospheres. The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target\nfor such a study, as its components stand at the L/T transition and show high\nlevels of variability. Luhman 16AB is also the third closest system to the\nSolar system, allowing precise astrometric investigations with ground-based\nfacilities. Aims. The aim of the work is to estimate the rotation period and\nstudy the astrometric motion of both components. Methods. We have monitored\nLuhman 16AB over a period of two years with the lucky-imaging camera mounted on\nthe Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla, through a special i+z long-pass filter,\nwhich allowed us to clearly resolve the two brown dwarfs into single objects.\nAn intense monitoring of the target was also performed over 16 nights, in which\nwe observed a peak-to-peak variability of 0.20 \\pm 0.02 mag and 0.34 \\pm 0.02\nmag for Luhman 16A and 16B, respectively. Results. We used the 16-night\ntime-series data to estimate the rotation period of the two components. We\nfound that Luhman 16B rotates with a period of 5.1 \\pm 0.1 hr, in very good\nagreement with previous measurements. For Luhman 16A, we report that it rotates\nslower than its companion and, even though we were not able to get a robust\ndetermination, our data indicate a rotation period of roughly 8 hr. This\nimplies that the rotation axes of the two components are well aligned and\nsuggests a scenario in which the two objects underwent the same accretion\nprocess. The 2-year complete dataset was used to study the astrometric motion\nof Luhman 16AB. We predict a motion of the system that is not consistent with a\nprevious estimate based on two months of monitoring, but cannot confirm or\nrefute the presence of additional planetary-mass bodies in the system.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication by Astronomy &\n  Astrophysics"]}]

We confirm the recently\nobserved triplet of states around 6.4 MeV, and find evidence that the state at\n6.29 MeV, just below the proton threshold, is either broad or a doublet. Our\ndata also suggest that predicted but yet unobserved levels may exist near the\n6.86 MeV state.

Furthermore, if x is of dimension K, then any\n2K entries of y are sufficient to recover x. This result implies the existence\nof deterministic unlabeled sensing matrices with an oversampling factor of 2\nthat admit perfect reconstruction. The result is universal in that recovery is\nguaranteed for all possible choices of x.

This work\npresents a new method for the integration of the relativistic hydrodynamic\nequations using iterated interpolating wavelets and introduces a highly\nadaptive implementation for multidimensional simulation.

Their kinetic energy of the explosions are larger\nby more than an order of magnitude than the typical values for this type of\nSNe, so that these SNe have been called `Hypernovae'. We first describe how the\nbasic properties of hypernovae can be derived from observations and modeling.\nThese hypernovae seem to come from rather massive stars, thus forming black\nholes. On the other hand, there are some examples of massive SNe with only a\nsmall kinetic energy. We suggest that stars with non-rotating black holes are\nlikely to collapse \"quietly\" ejecting a small amount of heavy elements (Faint\nsupernovae). In contrast, stars with rotating black holes are likely to give\nrise to very energetic supernovae (Hypernovae). We present distinct\nnucleosynthesis features of these two types of \"black-hole-forming\" supernovae.\nHypernova nucleosynthesis is characterized by larger abundance ratios\n(Zn,Co,V,Ti)/Fe and smaller (Mn,Cr)/Fe. Nucleosynthesis in Faint supernovae is\ncharacterized by a large amount of fall-back. We show that the abundance\npattern of the most Fe deficient star, HE0107-5240, and other extremely\nmetal-poor carbon-rich stars are in good accord with those of\nblack-hole-forming supernovae, but not pair-instability supernovae. This\nsuggests that black-hole-forming supernovae made important contributions to the\nearly Galactic (and cosmic) chemical evolution.\n","Comment: 49 pages, to be published in \"Stellar Collapse\" (Astrophysics and\n  Space Science; Kluwer) ed.
