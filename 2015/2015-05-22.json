On Earth and Mars, water ice forms ice sheets, ice caps and\nglaciers at the surface, which show glacial flow under their own weight. By\ncontrast, water ice is a major constituent of the bulk volume of the icy\nsatellites in the outer solar system, and ice flow can occur as thermal\nconvection. The rheology of polycrystalline aggregates of ordinary, hexagonal\nice Ih is described by a power law, different forms of which are discussed. The\ntemperature dependence of the ice viscosity follows an Arrhenius law.\nTherefore, the flow of ice in a planetary environment constitutes a\nthermo-mechanically coupled problem; its model equations are obtained by\ninserting the flow law and the thermodynamic material equations in the balance\nlaws of mass, momentum and energy. As an example of gravity-driven flow, the\npolar caps of Mars are discussed. For the north-polar cap, large-scale flow\nvelocities of the order of 0.1...1 mm/a are likely, locally enhanced by a\nfactor ten or more in the vicinity of surface scarps/troughs. By contrast, the\ncolder south-polar cap is expected to be almost stagnant.

Second, we present a\ncharacterization of the $\\epsilon$-interleaving relation on multidimensional\npersistence modules. This expresses transparently the sense in which two\n$\\epsilon$-interleaved modules are algebraically similar. Third, using this\ncharacterization, we show that when we define our persistence modules over a\nprime field, $d_I$ satisfies a universality property. This universality result\nis the central result of the paper. It says that $d_I$ satisfies a stability\nproperty generalizing one which $d_B$ is known to satisfy, and that in\naddition, if $d$ is any other pseudometric on multidimensional persistence\nmodules satisfying the same stability property, then $d\\leq d_I$.

The optimal solution of the joint\noptimization problem is derived using a graph theory approach by introducing\nthe cooperation graph and reformulating the problem as a maximum weight clique\nproblem in which the weight of each vertex is the contribution of the device\nidentified by the vertex. Through extensive simulations, the decoding delay\nexperienced by all devices in the Point to Multi-Point (PMP) configuration, the\nfully connected D2D (FC-D2D) configuration and the more practical partially\nconnected D2D (PC-D2D) configuration are compared.

These catalytic cycles place an upper limit of ~50%\non the amount of CO2 that can be destroyed via photolysis, which is enough to\ngenerate Earth-like abundances of (abiotic) O2 and O3.

Exact\nsummation also guarantees identical results with parallel and serial\nimplementations, since the exact sum is independent of order. The new methods\nuse variations on the concept of a \"superaccumulator\" - a large fixed-point\nnumber that can exactly represent the sum of any reasonable number of\nfloating-point values. One method uses a \"small\" superaccumulator with\nsixty-seven 64-bit chunks, each with 32-bit overlap with the next chunk,\nallowing carry propagation to be done infrequently.

It consists of 4096 64-bit chunks,\none for every possible combination of exponent bits and sign bit, plus counts\nof when each chunk needs to be transferred to the small superaccumulator. To\nadd a term to the large superaccumulator, only a single chunk and its\nassociated count need to be updated, which takes very few instructions if\ncarefully implemented. On modern 64-bit processors, exactly summing a large\narray using this combination of large and small superaccumulators takes less\nthan twice the time of simple, inexact, ordered summation, with a serial\nimplementation. A parallel implementation using a small number of processor\ncores can be expected to perform exact summation of large arrays at a speed\nthat reaches the limit imposed by memory bandwidth.

Species\nclimatic preferences were derived from their current distributions using\nclassification trees while habitats preferences were derived from the Red Data\nBook of the Flora of Cyprus.

Further,\ntheir limiting powers do not depend on the heaviness of the tails of the\ndistributions. This is in striking contrast to the asymptotic results obtained\nin the classical multivariate setup. On the other hand, we show that in the\npresence of stronger dependence among the coordinate variables, the spatial\nsign and rank based tests for high dimensional data can be asymptotically more\npowerful than the mean based tests if in addition to the data dimension, the\nsample size also grows to infinity. The sizes of some mean based tests for high\ndimensional data studied in the recent literature are observed to be\nsignificantly different from their nominal levels. This is due to the\ninadequacy of the asymptotic approximations used for the distributions of those\ntest statistics. However, our asymptotic approximations for the tests based on\nspatial signs and ranks are observed to work well when the tests are applied on\na variety of simulated and real datasets.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 5 figures and 2 tables"]}]

In order to understand the\nnature of this tangled web of magnetic fields, its magnetic skeleton, which\nforms the boundaries between topologically distinct flux domains, may be\ndetermined. The magnetic skeleton consists of null points, separatrix surfaces,\nspines and separators. The skeleton is often used to clearly visualize key\nelements of the magnetic configuration, but parts of the skeleton are also\nlocations where currents and waves may collect and dissipate.\n  In this review, the nature of the magnetic skeleton on both global and local\nscales, over solar cycle time scales, is explained. The behaviour of wave\npulses in the vicinity of both nulls and separators is discussed and so too is\nthe formation of current layers and reconnection at the same features. Each of\nthese processes leads to heating of the solar atmosphere, but collectively do\nthey provide enough heat, spread over a wide enough area, to explain the energy\nlosses throughout the solar atmosphere? Here, we consider this question for the\nthree different solar regions: active regions, open-field regions and the quiet\nSun.\n  We find that the heating of active regions and open-field regions is highly\nunlikely to be due to reconnection or wave dissipation at topological features,\nbut it is possible that these may play a role in the heating of the quiet Sun.\nIn active regions, the absence of a complex topology may play an important role\nin allowing large energies to build up and then, subsequently, be explosively\nreleased in the form of a solar flare. Additionally, knowledge of the intricate\nboundaries of open-field regions (which the magnetic skeleton provides) could\nbe very important in determining the main acceleration mechanism(s) of the\nsolar wind.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 5 pages"]}]

Exploiting\nexclusively the existence of space and time dependent symmetries of the\nnoiseless part of these equations, we derive expressions for the universal\nscaling functions of two-time quantities which are found to agree with the\nexact expressions obtained from the stochastic equations of motion. The\nusefulness of the space-time functions is illustrated through the investigation\nof two atomistic growth models, the Family model and the restricted Family\nmodel, which are shown to belong to a unique universality class in 1+1 and in\n2+1 space dimensions. This corrects earlier studies which claimed that in 2+1\ndimensions the two models belong to different universality classes.\n","Comment: 18 pages, three figures included, submitted to Phys. Rev.

In the uniform magnetic field limit, the brane magnetic\ncharge grows without limit while the energy and the radius of the brane remain\nfinite. In this limit the brane consists of a large number of small D-strings\nforming a hypertube and kept in equilibrium by the electric flux along the\nhypertube.\n","Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the authors. withdrawn by the author\n  due to an unjustified conjection"]}]
