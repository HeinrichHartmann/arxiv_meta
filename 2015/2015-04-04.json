In previous work we showed that\nwhen the dimensions are in the stable range, the rational homology groups of\nthese spaces can be calculated as the homology of a direct sum of certain\nfinite graph-complexes, which we described explicitly. In this paper, we\nestablish a similar result for the rational homotopy groups of these spaces. We\nalso put emphasis on different ways how the calculations can be done. In\nparticular we describe three different graph-complexes computing the rational\nhomotopy of spaces of long embeddings. We also compute the generating functions\nof the Euler characteristics of the summands in the homological splitting.\n","Comment: 51 pages (a couple of references added with comments).
