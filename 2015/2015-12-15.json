In this sense, we show that the renormalization flow of the\ntopologically nontrivial phase cannot be continuously deformed into a\ntopologically non-trivial one.

As a result they converge more slowly on\nsome problems (involving smooth, slowly-moving flows) but more rapidly on\nothers (involving advection or rotation).

The slope of the correlation is less steep than previously predicted.\nFurthermore, the cut-off of the power-law spectrum increases in energy with the\nEddington ratio, whereas the reflection fraction exhibits a decrease. We\ninterpret this behaviour as geometrical changes of the corona as a function of\nthe accretion rate. Below ~10% of the Eddington limit, the compact and\noptically thick corona is located close to the inner disc, whereas at higher\naccretion rates the corona is likely optically thin and extends vertically\nfurther away from the disc surface. Furthermore, we find a soft excess that\nconsists of two components. In addition to a contribution from reflection in\nlow ionization states, a second component is present that traces the overall\nflux.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in MNRAS"]}]

In the case\nof the merger, the stellar population in the central region is older than in\nthe tails, presenting a longer time-scale in comparison to central part in the\nisolated galaxy. Our results are in agreement with a scenario where spiral\ngalaxies are built from inside-out. In the case of the merger, we find evidence\nthat interactions enhance star formation in the central part of the galaxy.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures.

Moreover, the higher luminosity of O\nstars leads to ablation of optically thin disks on dynamical timescales of\norder a day, providing a natural explanation for the lack of observed Oe stars.\nIn addition to the destruction of Be disks, this dissertation also introduces a\nmodel for their formation by coupling observationally inferred non-radial\npulsation modes and rapid stellar rotation to launch material into orbiting\nKeplerian disks.\n  In contrast to such Be decretion disks, star-forming accretion disks are much\ndenser and so are generally optically thick to continuum processes. To\ncircumvent the computational challenges associated with radiation hydrodynamics\nthrough optically thick media, we develop an approximate method for treating\ncontinuum absorption in the limit of geometrically thin disks.

Narrow-beam operation in mmWave networks also reduces multiuser\ninterference, introducing the concept of noise-limited wireless networks as\nopposed to interference-limited ones. The noise-limited or interference-limited\nregime heavily reflects on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and\non proper resource allocation and interference management strategies. Yet,\nthese regimes are ignored in current approaches to mmWave MAC layer design,\nwith the potential disastrous consequences on the communication performance. In\nthis paper, we investigate these regimes in terms of collision probability and\nthroughput. We derive tractable closed-form expressions for the collision\nprobability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave ad hoc networks, operating under\nslotted ALOHA. The new analysis reveals that mmWave networks may exhibit a\nnon-negligible transitional behavior from a noise-limited regime to an\ninterference-limited one, depending on the density of the transmitters, density\nand size of obstacles, transmission probability, operating beamwidth, and\ntransmission power. Such transitional behavior necessitates a new framework of\nadaptive hybrid resource allocation procedure, containing both contention-based\nand contention-free phases with on-demand realization of the contention-free\nphase. Moreover, the conventional collision avoidance procedure in the\ncontention-based phase should be revisited, due to the transitional behavior of\ninterference, to maximize throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks.

First, the spherical-pendulum molecular model is reviewed, with the\naim of introducing an approximate method which consists in the separation of\nthe azimuthal and zenithal motions. Second, rotation spectra are considered in\nthe presence of a static electric field. Two particular cases are analyzed,\ncorresponding to strong and weak fields. In both cases the dipoles perform\nrotations and vibrations about equilibrium positions, which may exhibit\nparametric resonances. For strong fields a large macroscopic electric\npolarization may appear. This situation may be relevant for polar matter (like\npyroelectrics, ferroelectrics), or for heavy impurities embedded in a polar\nsolid. The dipolar interaction is analyzed in polar condensed matter, where it\nis shown that new polarization modes appear for a spontaneous macroscopic\nelectric polarization (these modes are tentatively called \"dipolons\"); one of\nthe polarization modes is related to parametric resonances. The extension of\nthese considerations to magnetic dipoles is briefly discussed.

Gas-solid\nfluidization is a typical nonlinear nonequilibrium system with multiscale\nstructure. In particular, the mesoscale structure in terms of bubbles or\nclusters, which can be characterized by nonequilibrium features in terms of\nbimodal velocity distribution, energy non equipartition, and correlated density\nfluctuations, is the critical factor. Traditional two-fluid model (TFM) and\nrelevant closures depend on local equilibrium and homogeneous distribution\nassumptions, and fail to predict the dynamic, nonequilibrium phenomena in\ncirculating fluidized beds even with fine-grid resolution. In contrast, the\nmesoscale modeling, as exemplified by the energy-minimization multiscale (EMMS)\nmodel, is consistent with the nonequilibrium features in multiphase flows.\nThus, the structure-dependent multi-fluid model conservation equations with the\nEMMS-based mesoscale modeling greatly improve the prediction accuracy in terms\nof flow, mass transfer, and reactions as well as the understanding of flow\nregime transitions. Such discrepancies raise the question of the applicability\nof the local equilibrium assumption underlying the TFM and further shed light\nto the necessity of mesoscale modeling.\n"]}]

We discuss two classes of\nACLCs: (i) externally driven ACLCs, in which the motion of colloidal particles\nis powered by an externally applied electric field, and (ii) internally driven\nACLCs, formed by self-propelled particles such as bacteria. The liquid crystal\n(LC) medium is of a thermotropic type in the first case and lyotropic (water\nbased) in the second case. In the absence of external fields and self-propelled\nparticles, the ACLCs are inactive, with the equilibrium LC state exhibiting\nlong-range orientational order. The external electric field causes ACLCs of\ntype (i) to experience translations, rotations, and orbiting, powered by\nmechanisms such as LC-enabled electrokinetics, Quincke rotations and entrapment\nat the defects of LC order. A dense system of Quincke rotators, orbiting along\ncircularly shaped smectic defects, undergoes a transition into a collective\ncoherent orbiting when their activity increases. An example of internally\ndriven ACLCs of type (ii) is living liquid crystals, representing swimming\nbacteria placed in an otherwise passive lyotropic chromonic LC. The LC strongly\naffects many aspects of bacterial behavior, most notably by shaping their\ntrajectories. As the concentration of bacteria and their activity increase, the\norientational order of living liquid crystals experiences two-stage\ninstability: first, the uniform steady equilibrium director is replaced with a\nperiodic bend deformation, then, at higher activity, pairs of positive and\nnegative disclinations nucleate, separate, and annihilate in dynamic patterns\nof topological turbulence.

We describe a hypothetical\nextended source of diffusing species and study its concentration profile in\nsteady-state conditions.

The derived fractional-order\ndistribution morphs into regular order diffusion in the case of integer\nfractional exponents. The model presented here demonstrates that accumulation\nof diffusing species can occur and the scar properties (i.e. tortuosity,\nfractional order, scar thickness) can influence such accumulation. The observed\nshape of the concentration profile corresponds qualitatively with GFAP profiles\nreported in the literature. The main difference with respect to the previous\nstudies is the explicit incorporation of the apparatus of fractional calculus\nwithout assumption of an ad hoc tortuosity parameter.

Its\nmain drawback (decrease of efficiency with increasing background) is overcame\nby the use of narrow slices in photometric redshift space. There are two main\nconcerns in structure detection. One is false detection and the second, the\nevaluation of the selection function in particular if one wants \"complete\"\nsamples. We deal here with the first concern using random distributions. For\nthe second, comparison with detailed simulations is foreseen but we use here a\npragmatic approach with comparing our results to GalICS simulations to check\nthat our detection number is not totally at odds compared to cosmological\nsimulations. We use XMM-LSS survey and secured VVDS redshifts up to z~1 to\ncheck individual detections. We show that our detection method is basically\ncapable to recover (in the regions in common) 100% of the C1 XMM-LSS X-ray\ndetections in the correct redshift range plus several other candidates.\nMoreover when spectroscopic data are available, we confirm our detections, even\nthose without X-ray data.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 22 additionnal jpeg figures, accepted in A&A"]}]
