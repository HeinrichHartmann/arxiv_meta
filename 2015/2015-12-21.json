Due to a\nserver breakdown, a copy of a file can be lost, it can be retrieved if another\ncopy of the same file is stored on other servers. In the case where no other\ncopy of a given file is present in the network, it is definitively lost. In\norder to have multiple copies of a given file, it is assumed that each server\ncan devote a fraction of its processing capacity to duplicate files on other\nservers to enhance the durability of the system.\n  A simplified stochastic model of this network is analyzed. It is assumed that\na copy of a given file is lost at some fixed rate and that the initial state is\noptimal: each file has the maximum number $d$ of copies located on the servers\nof the network. Due to random losses, the state of the network is transient and\nall files will be eventually lost. As a consequence, a transient\n$d$-dimensional Markov process $(X(t))$ with a unique absorbing state describes\nthe evolution this network. By taking a scaling parameter $N$ related to the\nnumber of nodes of the network. a scaling analysis of this process is\ndeveloped. The asymptotic behavior of $(X(t))$ is analyzed on time scales of\nthe type $t\\mapsto N^p t$ for $0\\leq p\\leq d{-}1$. The paper derives asymptotic\nresults on the decay of the network: Under a stability assumption, the main\nresults state that the critical time scale for the decay of the system is given\nby $t\\mapsto N^{d-1}t$. When the stability condition is not satisfied, it is\nshown that the state of the network converges to an interesting local\nequilibrium which is investigated. As a consequence it sheds some light on the\nrole of the key parameters $\\lambda$, the duplication rate and $d$, the maximal\nnumber of copies, in the design of these systems.\n"]}]

This paper presents a simple but effective scene-adaptive\ncoded aperture solution to bridge this gap. We observe that the geometric\nstructures in a natural scene often exhibit only a few edge directions, and the\nsuccessive frames are closely correlated. Therefore we adopt a spatial\npartitioning and temporal propagation scheme. In each frame, we address one\nprincipal direction by applying depth-discriminative codes along it and\nbroadband codes along its orthogonal direction. Since within a frame only the\nregions with edge direction corresponding to its aperture code behaves well, we\nutilize the close among-frame correlation to propagate the high quality single\nframe results temporally to obtain high performance over the whole image\nlattice. To physically implement this scheme, we use a Liquid Crystal on\nSilicon (LCoS) microdisplay that permits fast changing pattern codes. Firstly,\nwe capture the scene with a pinhole and analyze the scene content to determine\nprimary edge orientations. Secondly, we sequentially apply the proposed coding\nscheme with these orientations in the following frames.

By capturing a stack of low-resolution\nimages under different illumination angles, a nonlinear inverse algorithm can\nbe used to computationally reconstruct the high-resolution complex field. Here,\nwe compare and classify multiple proposed inverse algorithms in terms of\nexperimental robustness. We find that the main sources of error are noise,\naberrations and mis-calibration (i.e. model mis-match). Using simulations and\nexperiments, we demonstrate that the choice of cost function plays a critical\nrole, with amplitude-based cost functions performing better than\nintensity-based ones. The reason for this is that Fourier ptychography datasets\nconsist of images from both brightfield and darkfield illumination,\nrepresenting a large range of measured intensities. Both noise (e.g. Poisson\nnoise) and model mis-match errors are shown to scale with intensity. Hence,\nalgorithms that use an appropriate cost function will be more tolerant to both\nnoise and model mis-match. Given these insights, we propose a global Newton's\nmethod algorithm which is robust and computationally efficient.

We show that a direct discretization of the\nSchroedinger equation by central finite differences leads to a non-symmetric\nHamiltonian matrix. Because diagonalization of such matrices is more complex it\nis advantageous to transform it in a symmetric form. This can be done by the\nLiouville-like transformation proposed by Rizea et al.

Even\nthough a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix is produced by this procedure, the\ncomputed wave functions are found to be inaccurate near the origin, and the\naccuracy of the energy levels is not very high. In order to improve on this, we\ndevised a finite-difference scheme which discretizes the Schroedinger equation\nin the first step, and then applies the Liouville-like transformation to the\ndifference equation. Such a procedure gives a symmetric Hamiltonian matrix,\nresulting in an accuracy comparable to the one obtained with the finite element\nmethod.
