There is thus a\npressing need for multi-SNP analysis methods that can reveal system-level\ndifferences in cases and controls. Here, we present a novel multi-SNP GWAS\nanalysis method called Pathways of Distinction Analysis (PoDA). The method uses\nGWAS data and known pathway-gene and gene-SNP associations to identify pathways\nthat permit, ideally, the distinction of cases from controls. The technique is\nbased upon the hypothesis that if a pathway is related to disease risk, cases\nwill appear more similar to other cases than to controls for the SNPs\nassociated with that pathway. By systematically applying the method to all\npathways of potential interest, we can identify those for which the hypothesis\nholds true, i.e., pathways containing SNPs for which the samples exhibit\ngreater within-class similarity than across classes. Importantly, PoDA improves\non existing single-SNP and SNP-set enrichment analyses in that it does not\nrequire the SNPs in a pathway to exhibit independent main effects. This permits\nPoDA to reveal pathways in which epistatic interactions drives risk. In this\npaper, we detail the PoDA method and apply it to two GWA studies: one of breast\ncancer, and the other of liver cancer. The results obtained strongly suggest\nthat there exist pathway-wide genomic differences that contribute to disease\nsusceptibility.

Five-minute oscillation power in all observables is suppressed in\nthe sunspot and also in plage areas. Above the acoustic cut-off frequency, the\nbehaviour is more complicated: power in HMI $I_C$ is still suppressed in the\npresence of surface magnetic fields, while power in HMI $I_L$ and the AIA bands\nis suppressed in areas of surface field but enhanced in an extended area around\nthe active region, and power in HMI $V$ is enhanced in a narrow zone around\nstrong-field concentrations and suppressed in a wider surrounding area. The\nrelative phase of the observables, and their cross-coherence functions, are\nalso altered around the active region. These effects may help us to understand\nthe interaction of waves and magnetic fields in the different layers of the\nphotosphere, and will need to be taken into account in multi-wavelength local\nhelioseismic analysis of active regions.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 15 figures, to be published in Solar Physics"]}]

It is pointed out that such an approach, unlike Majorana's\n(non-chiral) old one, does not strictly lead, in general, to a true\nself-conjugate particle. This can be seen on directly using the basic\ndefinition (or fundamental representation) of charge conjugation $C$ in Quantum\nField Theory, as an operation just acting on annihilation and creation\noperators and just expressing particle--antiparticle interchange. It is found,\nindeed, that the `active' and `sterile' whole fields which can be obtained from\nmixing the chiral components of two mutually charge-conjugate Dirac fields are\nthemselves `charge conjugate' to each other (rather than individually\nself-conjugate). These fields, taken as mass eigenfields (as in the `Majorana\nmass' case), are shown to describe particles carrying pseudoscalar-type charges\nand being neutral relative to scalar-type charges only. For them, `$CP$\nsymmetry' would be nothing but pure mirror symmetry, and $C$ violation (already\nimplied in their respective `active' and `sterile' behaviors) should then\ninvolve time-reversal violation as well. The new (no longer strictly\nchargeless) `Majorana mass' neutrino model still proves, however, neither to\naffect the usual expectation for a neutrinoless double $\\beta$-decay, nor to\nprevent `active' and `sterile' neutrino varieties from generally taking\ndifferent mass values. One has, on the other hand, that any fermion being just\na genuine (i.e. really self-conjugate) Majorana particle cannot truly exist in\ntwo distinct $-$ `active' and `sterile' $-$ versions, and it can further bear\nonly a unified mass kind which may at once be said to be either a\n`Majorana-like' or a `Dirac-like' mass kind.\n","Comment: The final publication is available at Springer via\n  http://dx.doi.org/[10.1007/s10773-015-2818-5]"]}]

Since these rings\nare composed of small particles released from the surfaces of larger bodies,\nthey are reasonable analogs to debris disks and so their SPFs can provide\ninsights into the plausible scattering properties of debris disks. This work\nexamines two of Saturn's dusty rings: the G ring (at 167,500 km from Saturn's\ncenter) and the D68 ringlet (at 67,600 km). Using data from the cameras onboard\nthe Cassini spacecraft, we are able to estimate the rings' brightnesses at\nscattering angles ranging from 170 to 0.5 degrees. We find that both of the\nrings exhibit extremely strong forward-scattering peaks, but for scattering\nangles above 60 degrees their brightnesses are nearly constant. These SPFs can\nbe well approximated by a linear combination of three Henyey-Greenstein\nfunctions, and are roughly consistent with the SPFs of irregular particles from\nlaboratory measurements. Comparing these data to Fraunhofer and Mie models\nhighlights several challenges involved in extracting information about particle\ncompositions and size distributions from SPFs alone. The SPFs of these rings\nalso indicate that the degree of forward scattering in debris disks may be\ngreatly underestimated.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 15 Figures, Published in ApJ"]}]

In all cases, we find that\nspin plays a significant role during the adsorption process despite the general\nweakness of the molecular-magnetic responses. The case of CO$_2$ adsorption in\nNi-MOF74 is particularly interesting, as the inclusion of spin effects results\nin an increased attraction, opposite to what the diamagnetic nature of CO$_2$\nwould suggest. We explain this counter-intuitive result, tracking the behavior\nto a coincidental hybridization of the O $p$ states with the Ni $d$ states in\nthe down-spin channel. More generally, by providing insight on nonlocal\ncorrelation in concert with spin effects, our nonempirical svdW-DF method opens\nthe door for a deeper understanding of weak nonlocal magnetic interactions.\n","Comment: Phys.

In this paper, we formulate the power control and rate adaptation\nproblem with the objective of minimizing the time required for the concurrent\ntransmission of a set of sensor nodes while satisfying their transmission\ndelay, reliability and energy consumption requirements based on the more\nrealistic discrete rate transmission model, in which only a finite set of\ntransmit rates are supported. We propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve\nthis problem and prove the optimality of the proposed algorithm. We then\ncombine it with the previously proposed scheduling algorithms and demonstrate\nits close to optimal performance via extensive simulations.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, GLOBECOM Workshops 2015"]}]

With the help of Markov Chain Theory\nand Queuing Theory, we develop a new framework to fully characterize the packet\ndelivery processes, and obtain the relay-buffer blocking probability (RBP)\nunder any given exogenous packet input rate. Based on the RBP, we can compute\nthe packet queuing delay in its source node and delivery delay respectively,\nand further derive the end-to-end delay in such a MANET with limited buffer.\n"]}]

In this work, we\ndemonstrate a refined version of the optothermal Raman technique to measure the\nthermal transport properties of two TMDC materials, MoS2 and MoSe2, in\nsingle-layer (1L) and bi-layer (2L) forms. This new version incorporates two\ncrucial improvements over previous implementations. First, we utilize more\ndirect measurements of the optical absorption of the suspended samples under\nstudy and find values ~40% lower than previously assumed. Second, by comparing\nthe response of fully supported and suspended samples using different laser\nspot sizes, we are able to independently measure the interfacial thermal\nconductance to the substrate and the lateral thermal conductivity of the\nsupported and suspended materials. The approach is validated by examining the\nresponse of a suspended film illuminated in different radial positions. For 1L\nMoS2 and MoSe2, the room-temperature thermal conductivities are (84+/-17) W/mK\nand (59+/-18) W/mK, respectively. For 2L MoS2 and MoSe2, we obtain values of\n(77+/-25) W/mK and (42+/-13) W/mK. Crucially, the interfacial thermal\nconductance is found to be of order 0.1-1 MW/m2K, substantially smaller than\npreviously assumed, a finding that has important implications for design and\nmodeling of electronic devices.\n"]}]
