The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,\nfluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nbio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,\nare discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the\ntheory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid\nmembranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a\ncomposite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little\nsimilar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances\nhighly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nnano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A\nrevised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density\napproximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures\nand strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical\nmechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based\non this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial\nconcepts, the Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes, with this continuum form.\n","Comment: Review article for J.

Because quarks exist asymptotically only in bound states, their\ntransverse coordinates can never be measured with arbitrary precision; the\nnon-perturbative neglect of this statement leads to obstructions that are\neasily corrected by invoking in the basic Lagrangian a probability amplitude\nwhich describes such transverse imprecision.\n  The second result of this non-perturbative analysis is the appearance of a\nnew and simplifying output called \"Effective Locality\", in which the\ninteractions between quarks by the exchange of a \"gluon bundle\" - which\n\"bundle\" contains an infinite number of gluons, including cubic and quartic\ngluon interactions - display an exact locality property that reduces the\nseveral functional integrals of the formulation down to a set of ordinary\nintegrals.

Sorption\nhysteresis occurs, which can be explained by inclusion of these pollutants\ninside soil voids. 4. It was observed that the hydrophobic HCB is adsorbed on\nsoil stronger than the hydrophilic SAA. Moreover, the theoretical results\nshowed that HCB forms stable complexes with all SOM models in the aqueous\nsolution while most of SAA complexes are accompanied by dissociation. The\nSOM-cavity modeling showed a significant effect on binding of organic\npollutants to SOM.\n"]}]

This is based\non the difference of the parsimony scores of a single character on both trees\nunder consideration, and the goal is to find the character which maximizes this\ndifference. Here we show that computation of MP distance on two \\emph{binary}\nphylogenetic trees is NP-hard.

As a corollary to the main hardness result we show that computation\nof MP distance is also hard on binary trees if the number of states available\nis bounded. In fact, via a different reduction we show that it is hard even if\nonly two states are available. Finally, as a first response to this hardness we\ngive a simple Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation which is capable of\ncomputing the MP distance exactly for small trees (and for larger trees when\nonly a small number of character states are available) and which is used to\ncomputationally verify several auxiliary results required by the hardness\nproofs.\n","Comment: 37 pages, 8 figures"]}]

This paper summarizes the design\nof a programmable turbo decoder as an applicationspecific instruction-set\nprocessor (ASIP) using Transport Triggered Architecture (TTA). The processor\narchitecture is designed in such manner that it can be programmed to support\nother receiver algorithms, for example, decoding based on the Viterbi\nalgorithm. Different suboptimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithms are used\nand compared to one another for the softinput soft-output (SISO) component\ndecoders in a single TTA processor. The max-log-MAP algorithm outperforms the\nother suboptimal algorithms in terms of latency. The design enables the\ndesigner to change the suboptimal algorithms according to the bit error rate\n(BER) performance requirement.

In this work, we argue that both sparsity and the\ngrouping effect are important for subspace segmentation. A sparse affinity\nmatrix tends to be block diagonal, with less connections between data points\nfrom different subspaces. The grouping effect ensures that the highly corrected\ndata which are usually from the same subspace can be grouped together.

We also find\nthat the maximum compactification scales of extra dimensions quickly converge\ninto one special scale M_O near Planck scale or equivalently into one common\nradius R_0 irrespectively of d as the number of zero modes increases. It may\nmean that all extra dimensions emerge with the same radius near Planck scale.\nIn addition, it is shown that the supersymmetry can help to remove the\ndiscordance between the strong gravity scale and the unitarity violation scale.\n","Comment: 14 pages, containing 4 figures and 3 tables"]}]

The frequency-dependent PSF of the instrument complicates\nthis recovery, so we resort to splitting the observation bandwidth into smaller\nsegments, each of a common resolution.\n  If the foregrounds are allowed a random variation from the smooth power law\nalong the line of sight, methods exploiting the smoothness of foregrounds or a\nparametrization of their behaviour are challenged much more than non-parametric\nones.

An iconic question standing for\nsuch a challenge is how many variables are needed to define $k$-Clique in\nfirst-order logic on the class of finite ordered graphs? If $k$ variables are\nnecessary, as widely believed, it would imply that the bounded (or finite)\nvariable hierarchy in first-order logic is strict on the class of finite\nordered graphs. In 2008, Rossman made a breakthrough by establishing an optimal\naverage-case lower bound on the size of constant-depth unbounded fan-in\ncircuits computing $k$-Clique. In terms of logic, this means that it needs\ngreater than $\\lfloor\\frac{k} {4}\\rfloor$ variables to describe the $k$-Clique\nproblem in first-order logic on the class of finite ordered graphs, even in the\npresence of arbitrary arithmetic predicates. It follows, with an unpublished\nresult of Immerman, that the bounded variable hierarchy in first-order logic is\nindeed strict.

Two types of boundary value problems are\nconsidered in the algorithm development: (1) normal boundary condition, and (2)\ntangential boundary condition. A new variational formulation is developed for\nthe normal boundary value problem by using the Helmholtz decomposition which\navoids the computation of functions in the harmonic fields. Both boundary value\nproblems are reduced to a general saddle-point problem involving the curl and\ndivergence operators, for which the weak Galerkin finite element method is\ndevised and analyzed. The novelty of the technique lies in the discretization\nof the divergence operator applied to vector fields with heterogeneous media.\nError estimates of optimal order are established for the corresponding finite\nelement approximations in various discrete Sobolev norms.\n","Comment: 27 pages"]}]

Still there is a controversy about its\nimplications. Much of it has its roots in confusion regarding the premises from\nwhich the theorem can be derived. Some claim that a derivation of Bell's\ninequalities requires just locality assumption, and nothing more. Violations of\nthe inequalities are then interpreted as ``nonlocality'' or ``quantum\nnonlocality''. We show that such claims are unfounded and that every derivation\nof Bell's inequalities requires a premise -- in addition to locality and\nfreedom of choice -- which is either assumed tacitly, or unconsciously, or is\nembedded in a single compound condition (like Bell's ``local causality''). The\npremise is equivalent to the assumption of existence of additional variables\nwhich do not appear in the quantum formalism (in form of determinism, or joint\nprobability for outcomes of all conceivable measurements, or ``additional\ncauses`'', or ``hidden variables'', ``complete description of the state'' or\ncounterfactual definiteness, etc.). A certain irony is that perhaps the main\nmessage of violation of Bell's inequalities is that our notion of locality\nshould be based on an operationally well-defined no-signalling condition,\nrather than on local causality.\n","Comment: approximately the published version"]}]
