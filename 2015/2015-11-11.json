Recently, the importance of phase fluctuation of\nthe superconducting order parameter has gained significant support from various\nexperiments. However, the microscopic mechanism responsible for the\nsurprisingly soft phase remains one of the most important unsolved puzzles.\nHere, opposite to the standard BCS starting point, we propose a simple,\nsolvable low-energy model in the strong coupling limit, which maps the\nsuperconductivity literally into a well-understood physics of superfluid in a\nspecial dilute bosonic system of local pairs of doped holes.

Furthermore, a striking mass\ndivergence is predicted that dictates the occurrence of the observed quantum\ncritical point.

This work addresses the\nproblem of contact probability and contact rate of marine invertebrate larvae\nwith an isolated protruding collector located in an unbounded sea current.\nThere are two common approaches to the problem of contact probability.

Whereas most of the previous tight-binding models have been restricted\nto the K and K' points of the Brillouin zone (BZ), here we consider the effect\nof SOC in the whole BZ, and the results are compared to the band structure\nobtained by DFT methods. The tight-binding model is used to analyze the effect\nof SOC in the band structure, considering separately the contributions from the\ntransition metal and the chalcogen atoms. Finally, we present a scenario where,\nin the case of strong SOC, the spin/orbital/valley entanglement at the minimum\nof the conduction band at Q can be probed and be of experimental interest in\nthe most common cases of electron-doping reported for this family of compounds.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We propose\nthat statistics of novae in nearby galaxies may be a powerful tool to gauge the\nrole of such systems in producing SNeIa. Using multicycle nova evolutionary\nmodels, we compute the number and temporal distribution of novae that would be\nproduced by a typical (unstably burning) SNIa progenitor before reaching the\nChandrasekhar mass limit (M_ch) and exploding. Combined with the observed nova\nrates, this can be used to constrain the maximal contribution of the nova\nchannel to the SNIa rate in nearby galaxies. The M31 nova rate measured by the\nPOINT-AGAPE survey is 65/yr. Assuming that all these novae will reach M_ch, we\nobtain the maximal SNIa rate novae may produce to be (1-5)x10^-4/yr. This\nconstrains the overall contribution of the nova channel to the SNIa rate in M31\nat <2-7%. Furthermore, ~80% of novae generated by a successful SNIa progenitor\nhave short decay times (t2<10 days), and are produced when the WD mass is close\nto M_ch. We point out that statistics of such fast novae can provide a\nsensitive diagnostic of the contribution of the nova channel to the final\nstages of mass accumulation by the single degenerate (SD) SNIa progenitors. To\nexplore the prospects of their use, we investigate the efficiency of detecting\nfast novae in an M31 nova survey of the PTF class. We find that a survey with\nlimiting magnitude of m_R~22 observing at least every 2nd night will catch ~90%\nof fast novae expected in the SD scenario. Such surveys should be detecting\nfast novae in M31 at a rate of the order of >10^3xf per yr, where f is the\nfraction of SNeIa which accreted in the unstable nuclear burning regime while\naccumulating the final ~0.1M_sun before the SNIa explosion.\n","Comment: 14 pages, A&A, in press"]}]

For both the 0.7-anomaly and the Kondo effect, the conductance\nshows a remarkably similar low-energy dependence on temperature $T$,\nsource-drain voltage $V_{\\rm sd}$ and magnetic field $B$. In a recent\npublication [F.

We introduce a one-dimensional model that reproduces the essential\nfeatures of the experiments, including a smooth transition between a Kondo QD\nand a QPC with 0.7-anomaly. We find that in both cases the anomalously strong\nnegative magnetoconductance goes hand in hand with strongly enhanced local spin\nfluctuations.

Such a breakdown obtains in electronic systems whose pole-like\nexcitations do not extend to the edge of the Brillouin zone, as in Fermi arcs\nin the cuprates. Since any non-trivial infrared dynamics in strongly correlated\nelectron matter must be controlled by a critical fixed point, unparticles are\nthe natural candidate to explain the presence of charged degrees of freedom\nthat have no particle content. The continuous mass formulation of unparticles\nis recast as an action in anti de Sitter space. Such an action serves as the\ngenerating functional for the propagator. This mapping fixes the scaling\ndimension of the unparticle to be $d_U=d/2+\\sqrt{d^2+4}/2$ and ensures that the\ncorresponding propagator has zeros with $d$ the spacetime dimension of the\nunparticle field. The general {\\it dynamical} mechanism by which bulk\noperators, such as the Pauli term, couple to the scaling dimension of the\nboundary operator and thereby lead to a vanishing of the spectral weight at\nzero energy is reviewed in the context of unparticles and zeros.

The second method is to add a supplementary\nstate appropriately, which also works for LU conversion unlike the first\nmethod.

At higher densities, the hot coronal mass (including\nthe other baryonic components) exceeds the baryon budget of the Galaxy. If the\nH-alpha emission arises from the shock cascade, the upper limit on the smooth\ncoronal density constrains the Stream's mean distance to < 75 kpc.

However, measuring\nthe volume-weighted velocity statistics from galaxy (halo/simulation particle)\nvelocity data is challenging. For the first time, we apply the Kriging\ninterpolation to obtain the volume-weighted velocity field. Kriging is a\nminimum variance estimator. It predicts the most likely velocity for each place\nbased on the velocity at other places. We test the performance of Kriging\nquantified by the E-mode velocity power spectrum from simulations. Dependences\non the variogram prior used in Kriging, the number $n_k$ of the nearby\nparticles to interpolate and the density $n_P$ of the observed sample are\ninvestigated. First, we find that Kriging induces $1\\%$ and $3\\%$ systematics\nat $k\\sim 0.1h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ when $n_P\\sim 6\\times 10^{-2} ({\\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$\nand $n_P\\sim 6\\times 10^{-3} ({\\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, respectively.

Second, increasing\n$n_k$ helps to recover small scale power. However, for $n_P\\lesssim 6\\times\n10^{-4} ({\\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$ cases, the recovery is limited. Finally, Kriging is\nmore sensitive to the variogram prior for lower sample density. The most\nstraightforward application of Kriging on the cosmic velocity field does not\nshow obvious advantages over the nearest-particle method (Zheng et al. 2013)\nand could not be directly applied to cosmology so far.

The activity of CO ice in comparison to H_20 ice is capable to\ndetach aggregates smaller by approximately one order of magnitude from the\nsurface.

Asymptotic normalization\ncoefficients of Boron-8 are tightly constrained by existing radiative capture\ndata, and contributions to the cross section beyond external direct capture are\ndetected in the data at E < 0.5 MeV. Most importantly, the S-factor at zero\nenergy is constrained to be S(0)= 21.3 + - 0.7 eV b, which is an uncertainty\nsmaller by a factor of two than previously recommended. That recommendation was\nbased on the full range for S(0) obtained among a discrete set of models judged\nto be reasonable. In contrast, Halo EFT subsumes all models into a controlled\nlow-energy approximant, where they are characterized by nine parameters at\nnext-to-leading order. These are fit to data, and marginalized over via Monte\nCarlo integration to produce the improved prediction for S(E).\n","Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, and 1 supplemental material"]}]

We analyze potential stellar activity\ncycles by studying the variability amplitude over small boxes. The cycle\nperiods and amplitudes were computed based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram,\nharmonic fits, and visual inspection. As a first application of our approach we\nhave considered the photometric data for 16 CoRoT FGK main sequence stars,\nrevisited during the IRa01, LRa01 and LRa06 CoRoT runs. The 16 CoRoT stars\nappear to follow the empirical relations between activity cycle periods\n($P_{cyc}$) and the rotation period ($P_{rot}$) found by previous works. In\naddition to the so-called A (active) and I (inactive) sequences previously\nidentified, there is a possible third sequence, here named S (short-cycles)\nsequence. However, recovery fractions estimated from simulations suggest that\nonly a half of our sample has confident cycle measurements. Therefore, more\nstudy is needed to verify our results and Kepler data shall be notably useful\nfor such a study. Overall, our procedure provides a key tool for exploring the\nCoRoT and Kepler databases to identify and characterize stellar cycle\nvariability.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures"]}]

We find that the gas component extends at least from\n~100AU to ~250AU from the central star, and there should also be tenuous gas\nremaining inside and outside of these radii.

Second, we create a baseline dataset of verified human and fake\nfollower accounts. Such baseline dataset is publicly available to the\nscientific community. Then, we exploit the baseline dataset to train a set of\nmachine-learning classifiers built over the reviewed rules and features. Our\nresults show that most of the rules proposed by Media provide unsatisfactory\nperformance in revealing fake followers, while features proposed in the past by\nAcademia for spam detection provide good results. Building on the most\npromising features, we revise the classifiers both in terms of reduction of\noverfitting and cost for gathering the data needed to compute the features. The\nfinal result is a novel $\\textit{Class A}$ classifier, general enough to thwart\noverfitting, lightweight thanks to the usage of the less costly features, and\nstill able to correctly classify more than 95% of the accounts of the original\ntraining set. We ultimately perform an information fusion-based sensitivity\nanalysis, to assess the global sensitivity of each of the features employed by\nthe classifier. The findings reported in this paper, other than being supported\nby a thorough experimental methodology and interesting on their own, also pave\nthe way for further investigation on the novel issue of fake Twitter followers.\n"]}]

When quantizing free scalar fields in\nhomogeneous and isotropic spacetimes with compact spatial sections, these\ncriteria have been shown to pick out a unique Fock representation (up to\nunitary equivalence). Here, we employ the same criteria for fermion fields and\nexplore whether that uniqueness result can be extended to the case of the Fock\nquantization of fermions. For the massive Dirac field, we start by introducing\na specific choice of the complex structure that determines the Fock\nrepresentation. Such structure is invariant under the symmetries of the\nequations of motion. We then prove that the corresponding representation of the\ncanonical anticommutation relations admits a unitary implementation of the\ndynamics. Moreover, we construct a rather general class of representations that\nsatisfy the above criteria, and we demonstrate that they are all unitarily\nequivalent to our previous choice. The complex structures in this class are\nrestricted only by certain conditions on their asymptotic behavior for modes in\nthe ultraviolet sector of the Dirac operator. We finally show that, if one\nassumes that these asymptotic conditions are in fact trivial once our criteria\nare fulfilled, then the time-dependent scaling in the definition of the\nfermionic annihilation and creation-like variables is essentially unique.\n","Comment: 24 pages"]}]

The N2H+ emission is distributed in a ring with an inner radius\nat 90 AU, corresponding to a midplane temperature of 25 K. This result is\nconsistent with a new analysis of optically thin C18O data, which implies a\nsharp drop in CO abundance at 90 AU. Thus N2H+ appears to be a robust tracer of\nthe midplane CO snow line. The DCO+ emission also has a ring morphology, but\nneither the inner nor the outer radius coincides with the CO snow line location\nof 90 AU, indicative of a complex relationship between DCO+ emission and CO\nfreeze-out in the disk midplane. Compared to TW Hya, CO freezes out at a higher\ntemperature in the disk around HD 163296 (25 vs. 17 K in the TW Hya disk),\nperhaps due to different ice compositions.

While\nextremely successful at explaining the observed characteristics of flares, all\nsuch models so far have specified energy input ad hoc, rather than deriving it\nself-consistently. There is broad consensus that flares are powered by magnetic\nenergy released through reconnection. Recent work has generalized Petschek's\nbasic reconnection scenario, topological change followed by field line\nretraction and shock heating, to permit its inclusion into a one-dimensional\nflare loop model. Here we compare the gas dynamics driven by retraction and\nshocking to those from more conventional static loop models energized by ad hoc\nsource terms.

The loop-top\ndensity concentration is related to the slow magnetosonic shock, characteristic\nof Petschek's model, but persists beyond the retraction phase occurring in the\noutflow jet. This offers an explanation for observed loop-top sources of X-ray\nand EUV emission, with advantages over that provided by ad hoc heating\nscenarios.

Methods:\nFLAMES-GIRAFFE data taken with the VLT towards early-type stars in 3 Galactic &\n4 Magellanic open clusters in CaII are used to obtain the velocity, EW, column\ndensity and line width of IS Galactic Ca for a total of 657 stars, of which 443\nare Magellanic sightlines.

Results: For the four\nMagellanic clusters studied with FLAMES, the strength of the Galactic IS CaII K\nEW over transverse scales from 0.05-9 pc is found to vary by factors of\n1.8-3.0, corresponding to column density variations of 0.3-0.5 dex in the\noptically-thin approximation.

Existing\ntechniques for disaggregation rely on energy metering at a resolution of 1\nminute or higher, but most power meters today only provide a reading once per\nmonth, and at most once every 15 minutes. In this paper, we propose a new\ntechnique called Neighbourhood NILM that leverages data from 'neighbouring'\nhomes to disaggregate energy given only a single energy reading per month. The\nkey intuition behind our approach is that 'similar' homes have 'similar' energy\nconsumption on a per-appliance basis. Neighbourhood NILM matches every home\nwith a set of 'neighbours' that have direct submetering infrastructure, i.e.\npower meters on individual circuits or loads. Many such homes already exist.\nThen, it estimates the appliance-level energy consumption of the target home to\nbe the average of its K neighbours. We evaluate this approach using 25 homes\nand results show that our approach gives comparable or better disaggregation in\ncomparison to state-of-the-art accuracy reported in the literature that depend\non manual model training, high frequency power metering, or both. Results show\nthat Neighbourhood NILM can achieve 83% and 79% accuracy disaggregating fridge\nand heating/cooling loads, compared to 74% and 73% for a technique called FHMM.\nFurthermore, it achieves up to 64% accuracy on washing machine, dryer,\ndishwasher, and lighting loads, which is higher than previously reported\nresults. Many existing techniques are not able to disaggregate these loads at\nall. These results indicate a potentially substantial advantage to installing\nsubmetering infrastructure in a select few homes rather than installing new\nhigh-frequency smart metering infrastructure in all homes.\n","Comment: Under submission to IPSN 2016"]}]

We study a Greedy-Random (GRAND) placement\n(packing) algorithm, introduced in [23]. This is a simple online algorithm,\nwhich places each arriving customer uniformly at random into either one of the\nalready occupied servers that can still fit the customer, or one of the\nso-called zero-servers, which are empty servers designated to be available to\nnew arrivals.

GRAND($aZ$) was shown in [23] to be asymptotically optimal in the\nfollowing sense: (a) the steady-state optimality gap grows linearly in the\nsystem scale $r$ (the mean total number of customers in service), i.e. as $c(a)\nr$ for some $c(a)> 0$; and (b) $c(a) \\to 0$ as $a\\to 0$.

I will argue that the most physically\nuseful definition of a starburst is its ``intensity'' (star formation rate per\nunit area). This is the most natural parameter to compare local starbursts with\nphysically similar galaxies at high redshift, and indeed I will argue that\nlocal starbursts are unique laboratories to study the processes at work in the\nearly universe. I will describe how NASA's GALEX mission has uncovered a rare\npopulation of close analogs to Lyman Break Galaxies in the local universe. I\nwill then compare local starbursts to the Lyman-Break and sub-mm galaxies high\nredshift populations, and speculate that the multidimensional ``manifold'' of\nstarbursts near and far can be understood largely in terms of the\nSchmidt/Kennicutt law and galaxy mass-metallicity relation. I will briefly\nsummarize he properties of starburst-driven galactic superwinds and their\npossible implications for the evolution of galaxies and the IGM.

The evidence that mergers of gas-rich galaxies tend\nto trigger galaxy-wide starbursts is strong, both statistically and in\nindividual cases of major disk-disk mergers. Star formation rates appear\nenhanced by factors of a few to ~10^3 above normal. Detailed studies of nearby\nmergers and ULIRGs suggest that the main trigger for starbursts is the rapidly\nmounting pressure of the ISM in extended shock regions, rather than high-\nvelocity, ~50 - 100 km/s cloud-cloud collisions. Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that in colliding galaxies the star formation rate depends not only\non the gas density, but crucially also on energy dissipation in shocks. An\noften overlooked characteristic of merger-induced starbursts is that the\nspatial distribution of the enhanced star formation extends over large scales\n(~10 - 20 kpc). Thus, although most such starbursts do peak near the galactic\ncenters, young stellar populations pervade merger remnants and explain why (1)\nage gradients in descendent galaxies are mild and (2) resultant cluster systems\nare far-flung.
