Here\nwe give a further step by addressing the effect of diffusion in two simple\nlattice models originally presenting discontinuous absorbing transitions. They\nhave been studied via mean-field theory (MFT) and distinct sort of numerical\nsimulations. For both cases, results suggest that the diffusion does not change\nthe order of the transition, regardless its strength and thus, in partial\ncontrast with results obtained from Langevin approach.

Lyman alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) are used to probe the distant\nuniverse and are therefore important for galaxy evolution studies and for\nproviding clues to the nature of the epoch of reionization, but the exact\ncircumstances under which Lyman alpha escapes a galaxy are still not fully\nunderstood.\n  Aims. The Trident project is designed to simultaneously examine Lyman alpha,\nH-alpha and Lyman Continuum emission from galaxies at redshift z~2, thus\nlinking together these three aspects of ionising radiation in galaxies. In this\npaper, we outline the strategy of this project and examine the properties of\nLAEs in the GOODS North field.\n  Methods. We performed a narrowband LAE survey in GOODS North using existing\nand two custom made filters at the Nordic Optical Telescope with MOSCA. We use\ncomplementary broad band archival data in the field to make a careful candidate\nselection and perform optical to near-IR SED fitting. We also estimate\nfar-infrared luminosities by matching our candidates to detections in\nSpitzer/MIPS 24{\\mu}m and Herschel/PACS catalogs.\n  Results. We find a total of 25 LAE candidates, probing mainly the bright end\nof the LAE luminosity function with L_Ly {\\alpha} ~ 1-15e42 erg/s. They display\na range of masses of ~0.5-50e9 M_solar, and average ages from a few tens of Myr\nto 1 Gyr when assuming a constant star formation history. The majority of our\ncandidates also show signs of recent elevated star formation. Three candidates\nhave counterparts in the GOODS-Herschel far-IR catalogue, with luminosities\nconsistent with ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).\n  Conclusions. The wide range of parameters derived from our SED fitting, as\nwell as part of our sample being detected as ULIRGs, seems to indicate that at\nthese Lyman alpha luminosities, LAEs do not necessarily have to be young\ndwarfs, and that a lack of dust is not required for Lyman alpha to escape.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 12 figures.

It has\nbeen shown to outperform many of the existing feature selection methods for a\nvariety of applications. Though, better than many existing approaches, the\nrunning time complexity of QPFS is cubic in the number of features, which can\nbe quite computationally expensive even for moderately sized datasets. In this\npaper we propose a novel method for feature selection by integrating k-means\nclustering with QPFS. The basic variant of our approach runs k-means to bring\ndown the number of features which need to be passed on to QPFS. We then enhance\nthis idea, wherein we gradually refine the feature space from a very coarse\nclustering to a fine-grained one, by interleaving steps of QPFS with k-means\nclustering. Every step of QPFS helps in identifying the clusters of irrelevant\nfeatures (which can then be thrown away), whereas every step of k-means further\nrefines the clusters which are potentially relevant. We show that our iterative\nrefinement of clusters is guaranteed to converge. We provide bounds on the\nnumber of distance computations involved in the k-means algorithm. Further,\neach QPFS run is now cubic in number of clusters, which can be much smaller\nthan actual number of features.

We model the\nunderlying particle spectrum with a single population of electrons emitting\nsynchrotron radiation, and do a statistical fitting of the simultaneous,\ntime-resolved data from the Swift-XRT and the NuSTAR. Results: There was rapid\nflux variability in the X-ray band, with a minimum doubling timescale of $1.69\n\\pm 0.13$ hrs. There were no corresponding flares in UV and gamma bands. The\nvariability in UV and gamma rays are relatively modest with $ \\sim 8 \\% $ and\n$\\sim 16 \\% $ respectively, and no significant correlation was found with the\nX-ray light curve. The observed X-ray spectrum shows clear curvature which can\nbe fit by a log parabolic spectral form. This is best explained to originate\nfrom a log parabolic electron spectrum. However, a broken power law or a power\nlaw with an exponentially falling electron distribution cannot be ruled out\neither. Moreover, the excellent broadband spectrum from $0.3-79$ keV allows us\nto make predictions of the UV flux. We find that this prediction is compatible\nwith the observed flux during the low state in X-rays. However, during the\nX-ray flares, the predicted flux is a factor of $2-50$ smaller than the\nobserved one. This suggests that the X-ray flares are plausibly caused by a\nseparate population which does not contribute significantly to the radiation at\nlower energies. Alternatively, the underlying particle spectrum can be much\nmore complex than the ones explored in this work.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures, Accepted in A&A"]}]

Normal-hearing\nlisteners benefit from across-frequency processing, as seen with improved ITD\nthresholds when consistent ITD cues are presented over a range of frequency\nchannels compared to when ITD information is only presented in a single\nfrequency channel. This study aimed to clarify whether cochlear-implant (CI)\nlisteners can make use of similar processing when being stimulated with\nmultiple interaural electrode pairs transmitting consistent ITD information.\nITD thresholds for unmodulated, 100-pulse-per-second pulse trains were measured\nin seven bilateral CI listeners using research interfaces. Consistent ITDs were\npresented at either one or two electrode pairs at different current levels,\nallowing for comparisons at either constant level per component electrode or\nequal overall loudness. Different tonotopic distances between the pairs were\ntested in order to clarify the potential influence of channel interaction.\nComparison of ITD thresholds between double pairs and the respective single\npairs revealed systematic effects of tonotopic separation and current level. At\nconstant levels, performance with double-pair stimulation improved compared to\nsingle-pair stimulation, but only for large tonotopic separation. Comparisons\nat equal overall loudness revealed no benefit from presenting ITD information\nat two electrode pairs for any tonotopic spacing. Irrespective of\nelectrode-pair configuration, ITD sensitivity improved with increasing current\nlevel. Hence, the improved ITD sensitivity for double pairs found for a large\ntonotopic separation and constant current levels seems to be due to increased\nloudness. The overall data suggest that CI listeners can benefit from combining\nconsistent ITD information across multiple electrodes, provided sufficient\nstimulus levels and that stimulating electrode pairs are widely spaced.\n","Comment: submitted to JARO on 3 November 2014, Resubmitted revised version on\n  1 June 2015, Resubmitted revised version on 3 August 2015"]}]

A model of simultaneous translation is specifically important when\ndealing with highly expressed genes, as these consume more resources.

We also show that the area under the extended belief propagation (BP)\nextrinsic information transfer curve (defined for the equivalent graph),\ncomputed for the expected residual CB graph when a peeling decoder equivalent\nto the BP decoder stops, is equal to zero precisely at the area threshold.\nThis, combined with simulations and an asymptotic analysis of the Maxwell\ndecoder, leads to the conjecture that the area threshold is in fact equal to\nthe Maxwell decoding threshold and hence a lower bound on the maximum a\nposteriori (MAP) decoding threshold. Finally, we present some numerical results\nand give some insight into the apparent gap of the BP decoding threshold of\nSC-CBs to the conjectured lower bound on the MAP decoding threshold.\n","Comment: To appear in the IEEE Information Theory Workshop, Jeju Island,\n  Korea, October 2015"]}]

These relative data structures provide competitive\ntime/space trade-offs, being almost as small as the smallest compressed suffix\ntrees for repetitive collections, and almost as fast as the largest and fastest\ncompressed suffix trees. They also provide access to the suffix trees of\nindividual sequences, instead of storing all sequences in the same tree.\n","Comment: The implementation is available at\n  https://github.com/jltsiren/relative-fm"]}]

In this study we propose and investigate the\napplication of FETI methods to simulate the elastic behavior of biological soft\ntissues. As one particular example we choose the artery which is - as most\nother biological tissues - characterized by anisotropic and nonlinear material\nproperties. We compare two specific approaches of FETI methods, classical and\nall-floating, and investigate the numerical behavior of different\npreconditioning techniques. In comparison to classical FETI, the all-floating\napproach has not only advantages concerning the implementation but in many\ncases also concerning the convergence of the global iterative solution method.\nThis behavior is illustrated with numerical examples. We present results of\nlinear elastic simulations to show convergence rates, as expected from the\ntheory, and results from the more sophisticated nonlinear case where we apply a\nwell-known anisotropic model to the realistic geometry of an artery. Although\nthe FETI methods have a great applicability on artery simulations we will also\ndiscuss some limitations concerning the dependence on material parameters.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]

Each\nagent is assigned goals expressed in a fragment of linear temporal logic known\nas generalized reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)). These goals may be unrealizable,\nunless additional assumptions are made by each agent about the behavior of the\nother agents. The proposed algorithm constructs weakly fair assumptions for\neach agent, to ensure that they can cooperate successfully. A necessary\nrequirement is that the given goals be cooperatively satisfiable. We prove that\nthere exist games for which the GR(1) fragment with liveness properties over\nstates is not sufficient to ensure realizability from any state in the\ncooperatively winning set. The obstruction is due to circular dependencies of\nliveness goals. To prevent circularity, we introduce nested games as a\nformalism to express specifications with conditional assumptions. The algorithm\nis symbolic, with fixpoint structure similar to the GR(1) synthesis algorithm,\nimplying time complexity polynomial in the number of states, and linear in the\nnumber of recurrence goals.\n"]}]
