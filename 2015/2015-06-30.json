Using resolution\ngraphs to extract UCs is common in other domains such as SAT. In this article\nwe construct and optimize resolution graphs for temporal resolution as\nimplemented in the temporal resolution-based solver TRP++, and we use them to\nextract UCs for propositional LTL. The resulting UCs are more fine-grained than\nthe UCs obtained from existing tools because UC extraction also simplifies\ntop-level conjuncts instead of treating them as atomic entities. For example,\ngiven an unsatisfiable LTL formula of the form $\\phi \\equiv ({\\bf G} \\psi)\n\\wedge {\\bf F} \\psi'$ existing tools return $\\phi$ as a UC irrespective of the\ncomplexity of $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$, whereas the approach presented in this\narticle continues to remove parts not required for unsatisfiability inside\n$\\psi$ and $\\psi'$. Our approach also identifies groups of occurrences of a\nproposition that do not interact in a proof of unsatisfiability. We implement\nour approach in TRP++.

We suggest that dephasing plays an important role in\ndetermining the transport properties of SAM-MJs. We present an approach for\ncalculating the transport properties of SAM-MJs that inherently takes into\naccount in-plane dephasing in the electron motion as it traverses the SAM\nplane. The calculation is based on the non-equilibrium Green's function\nformalism, with a local dynamics approximation that describes incoherent motion\nalong the SAM plane. Our approach describes well the two hallmarks of transport\nthrough SAM-MJs, namely the exponential decay of current with molecular chain\nlength and the reduction of the current per molecule as compared to\nsingle-molecule junctions. Specifically, we show that dephasing leads to an\nexponential decay of the current as a function of molecular length, even for\nresonant tunneling, where the fully coherent calculation shows little or no\nlength-dependence of the current. The dephasing is also shown to lead to a\nsubstantial reduction of the current in a SAM-MJ as compared to the single\nmolecule junction, in a realistic parameter regime, where the coherent\ncalculation shows only a very small reduction of the current. Finally, we\ndiscuss the effect of dephasing on more subtle transport phenomena such as the\nconductance even-odd effect and negative differential resistance.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted to J.

Using 3D high-resolution simulations, we probe the impact of\nrotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a typical massive galaxy. In the\nhot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a\ngeometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the accretion rate to ~1/3\nof the Bondi rate. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure\nsupport and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk. In the more common state\nof a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas\nvelocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor\nnumber < 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via\nthermal instability and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate\nup to 100 times the Bondi rate. Initially, turbulence broadens the angular\nmomentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with\nprograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold\nfilaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of\nangular momentum, leading to high accretion rates.

The main reason being that\nthe U(1) symmetries that are typically discussed in the literature are either\nanomalous or have to be broken at a high scale to generate light neutrino\nmasses. In this paper we use for that purpose the self duality property under\nthe spinor vector duality, which was discovered in free fermionic\nheterotic-string models.

This phenomenon has been\nextensively studied in the linear response regime, i.e., when the average drift\nvelocity of the electrons is a small fraction of the Fermi velocity. Here we\ninvestigate the phenomenon in the nonlinear regime, meaning that the average\ndrift velocity is comparable to, or exceeds the Fermi velocity. This regime is\nrealized when the electric field is very large, or when electron-impurity\nscattering is very weak. The quantum kinetic equation for the density matrix of\nnoninteracting electrons is exactly and analytically solvable, reducing to a\nproblem of spin dynamics for \"unpaired\" electrons near the Fermi surface. The\ncrucial parameter is $\\gamma=eEL_s/E_F$, where $E$ is the electric field, $e$\nis the absolute value of the electron charge, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy, and\n$L_s = \\hbar/(2m\\alpha)$ is the spin-precession length in the Rashba spin-orbit\nfield with coupling strength $\\alpha$. If $\\gamma\\ll1$ the evolution of the\nspin is adiabatic, resulting in a spin polarization that grows monotonically in\ntime and eventually saturates at the maximum value $n(\\alpha/v_F)$, where $n$\nis the electron density and $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. If $\\gamma \\gg 1$ the\nevolution of the spin becomes strongly non-adiabatic and the spin polarization\nis progressively reduced, and eventually suppressed for $\\gamma\\to \\infty$. We\nalso predict an inverse nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which an electric\ncurrent is driven by a magnetic field that grows linearly in time. The\n\"conductivities\" for the direct and the inverse effect satisfy generalized\nOnsager reciprocity relations, which reduce to the standard ones in the linear\nresponse regime.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Traditionally, estimates of running times of such sampling algorithms\nare computed using the number of steps in the chain needed to reach the\nstationary distribution. This quantity is generally defined as mixing time and\nis often difficult to compute. In this paper, we suggest an alternative\nestimate based on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, by establishing a link between\nthe maximization of KSE and the minimization of the mixing time. Since KSE are\neasier to compute in general than mixing time, this link provides a new faster\nmethod to approximate the minimum mixing time that could be interesting in\ncomputer sciences and statistical physics. Beyond this, our finding will also\nbe of interest to the out-of-equilibrium community, by providing a new rational\nto select stationary states in out-of-equilibrium physics: it seems reasonable\nthat in a physical system with two simultaneous equiprobable possible dynamics,\nthe final stationary state will be closer to the stationary state corresponding\nto the fastest dynamics (smallest mixing time).Through the empirical link found\nin this letter, this state will correspond to a state of maximal\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy.

The uncertainty emerges from number\nfluctuations, called genetic drift, arising in the small number of particularly\nfit individuals of the population. Random genetic drift in this evolutionary\nvanguard also limits the speed of adaptation, which diverges in deterministic\nmodels that ignore these chance effects. Several approaches have been developed\nto analyze the crucial role of noise on the expected dynamics of adaptation,\nincluding the mean fitness of the entire population, or the fate of newly\narising beneficial deleterious mutations. However, very little is known about\nhow genetic drift causes fluctuations to emerge on the population level,\nincluding fitness distribution variations and speed variations.

This constraint regulates (rather\nthan fixes) the population size, accounting for resource limitations. The\nresulting linear equations, which can be accurately solved numerically, exhibit\nfluctuation-induced terms that amplify short-distance correlations and suppress\nlong-distance ones.

For a nonnegative\ninteger $k$, $B_k$-EPG graphs are defined as EPG graphs admitting a model in\nwhich each path has at most $k$ bends. Circular-arc graphs are intersection\ngraphs of open arcs of a circle. It is easy to see that every circular-arc\ngraph is a $B_4$-EPG graph, by embedding the circle into a rectangle of the\ngrid. In this paper, we prove that every circular-arc graph is $B_3$-EPG, and\nthat there exist circular-arc graphs which are not $B_2$-EPG. If we restrict\nourselves to rectangular representations (i.e., the union of the paths used in\nthe model is contained in a rectangle of the grid), we obtain EPR (edge\nintersection of path in a rectangle) representations.
