Still, there are few tools that perform automated\nextraction of UCs for LTL. Existing tools compute a UC as an unsatisfiable\nsubset of the set of top-level conjuncts of an LTL formula. Using resolution\ngraphs to extract UCs is common in other domains such as SAT. In this article\nwe construct and optimize resolution graphs for temporal resolution as\nimplemented in the temporal resolution-based solver TRP++, and we use them to\nextract UCs for propositional LTL. The resulting UCs are more fine-grained than\nthe UCs obtained from existing tools because UC extraction also simplifies\ntop-level conjuncts instead of treating them as atomic entities. For example,\ngiven an unsatisfiable LTL formula of the form $\\phi \\equiv ({\\bf G} \\psi)\n\\wedge {\\bf F} \\psi'$ existing tools return $\\phi$ as a UC irrespective of the\ncomplexity of $\\psi$ and $\\psi'$, whereas the approach presented in this\narticle continues to remove parts not required for unsatisfiability inside\n$\\psi$ and $\\psi'$. Our approach also identifies groups of occurrences of a\nproposition that do not interact in a proof of unsatisfiability. We implement\nour approach in TRP++.

By extrapolating the\n870um number counts to S_ 870um=1mJy, we show that the contribution of\nS_870um>1mJy SMGs to the cosmic star formation budget is 20% of the total over\nthe redshift range z~1-4. We derive a median dust mass for these SMGs of\nM_d=(3.6+/-0.3)x10^8Mo and by adopting an appropriate gas-to-dust ratio, we\nestimate an average molecular mass of M_H2=(4.2+/-0.4)x10^{10}Mo. Finally, we\nuse our estimates of the H2 masses to show that SMGs with S_870um>1mJy contain\n~10% of the z~2 volume-averaged H2 mass density at this epoch.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS. 24 pages, 12 figures"]}]

Although in this context the natural analog of the\npolynomial ring over a field is the polynomial semiring over a semifield\n(without a zero element), one obtains homomorphic images of coordinate algebras\nvia congruences rather than ideals, which complicates the algebraic theory\nconsiderably.\n  In this paper, we pass to the semifield $F(\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n)$ of\nfractions of the polynomial semiring, for which there already exists a well\ndeveloped theory of kernels, which are normal convex subgroups; this approach\nenables us to switch the structural roles of addition and multiplication and\nmakes available much of the extensive theory of chains of homomorphisms of\ngroups, including the Jordan-Holder theory. The parallel of the zero set now is\nthe 1-set.\n  These notions are refined in the language of supertropical algebra to\n$\\nu$-kernels and $1^\\nu$-sets, lending more precision to the theory. In\nanalogy to Hilbert's celebrated Nullstellensatz which provides a correspondence\nbetween radical ideals and zero sets, we develop a correspondence between\n$1^\\nu$-sets and a well-studied class of $\\nu$-kernels of the rational\nsemifield called polars, originating from the theory of lattice-ordered groups.\nThis correspondence becomes simpler and more applicable when restricted to a\nspecial kind of kernel, called principal, intersected with the kernel generated\nby $F$. We utilize this theory to study tropical roots in tropical geometry. As\nan application, we develop composition series and convexity degree, leading to\na tropical version of the Jordan-H\\\"{o}lder theorem.\n","Comment: 58 pages.

We suggest that dephasing plays an important role in\ndetermining the transport properties of SAM-MJs. We present an approach for\ncalculating the transport properties of SAM-MJs that inherently takes into\naccount in-plane dephasing in the electron motion as it traverses the SAM\nplane. The calculation is based on the non-equilibrium Green's function\nformalism, with a local dynamics approximation that describes incoherent motion\nalong the SAM plane. Our approach describes well the two hallmarks of transport\nthrough SAM-MJs, namely the exponential decay of current with molecular chain\nlength and the reduction of the current per molecule as compared to\nsingle-molecule junctions. Specifically, we show that dephasing leads to an\nexponential decay of the current as a function of molecular length, even for\nresonant tunneling, where the fully coherent calculation shows little or no\nlength-dependence of the current. The dephasing is also shown to lead to a\nsubstantial reduction of the current in a SAM-MJ as compared to the single\nmolecule junction, in a realistic parameter regime, where the coherent\ncalculation shows only a very small reduction of the current. Finally, we\ndiscuss the effect of dephasing on more subtle transport phenomena such as the\nconductance even-odd effect and negative differential resistance.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted to J.

Using 3D high-resolution simulations, we probe the impact of\nrotation on the hot and cold accretion flow in a typical massive galaxy. In the\nhot mode, with or without turbulence, the pressure-dominated flow forms a\ngeometrically thick rotational barrier, suppressing the accretion rate to ~1/3\nof the Bondi rate. When radiative cooling is dominant, the gas loses pressure\nsupport and quickly circularizes in a cold thin disk. In the more common state\nof a turbulent and heated atmosphere, CCA drives the dynamics if the gas\nvelocity dispersion exceeds the rotational velocity, i.e., turbulent Taylor\nnumber < 1. Extended multiphase filaments condense out of the hot phase via\nthermal instability and rain toward the black hole, boosting the accretion rate\nup to 100 times the Bondi rate. Initially, turbulence broadens the angular\nmomentum distribution of the hot gas, allowing the cold phase to condense with\nprograde or retrograde motion. Subsequent chaotic collisions between the cold\nfilaments, clouds, and a clumpy variable torus promote the cancellation of\nangular momentum, leading to high accretion rates. The simulated sub-Eddington\naccretion rates cover the range inferred from AGN cavity observations.

Such dichotomy is key\nfor the long-term AGN feedback cycle. As gas cools, filamentary CCA develops\nand boosts AGN heating; the cold mode is thus reduced and the rotating disk\nremains the sole cold structure.

The anomaly free gauge symmetry in the\neffective low energy field theory of our string model is $SU(4)_C\\times\nSU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R\\times U(1)_\\zeta$, where $U(1)_\\zeta$ is the family\nuniversal $U(1)$ symmetry that descends from E6, and is typically anomalous in\nother free fermionic heterotic-string models.

Depending on the model parameters, the chiral transition occurs in\nthe baryon density range of $(1.5-15.5)n_0$, while the deconfinement transition\noccurs above $5 n_0$, where $n_0$ is the saturation density.\n","Comment: References added, some points further elaborated, main conclusions\n  unchanged, accepted in Phys Rev D"]}]

The effects of different input\nparameters on the final period and eccentricity of a binary-evolution model are\ntested with MESA. The end products of models with only tidally-enhanced wind\nmass-loss can indeed be eccentric, but these models need to lose too much mass,\nand invariably end up with a helium white dwarf that is too light to ignite\nhelium. Within the tested parameter space, no sdBs in eccentric systems are\nformed. Phase-dependent RLOF can reintroduce eccentricity during RLOF, and\ncould help to populate the short-period part of the period-eccentricity\ndiagram. When phase-dependent RLOF is combined with eccentricity pumping via a\ncircumbinary disk, the higher eccentricities can be reached as well. A\nremaining problem is that these models favour a distribution of higher\neccentricities at lower periods, while the observed systems show the opposite.\nThe models presented here are potentially capable of explaining the\nperiod-eccentricity distribution of long-period sdB binaries, but further\ntheoretical work on the physical mechanisms is necessary.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

This phenomenon has been\nextensively studied in the linear response regime, i.e., when the average drift\nvelocity of the electrons is a small fraction of the Fermi velocity. Here we\ninvestigate the phenomenon in the nonlinear regime, meaning that the average\ndrift velocity is comparable to, or exceeds the Fermi velocity. This regime is\nrealized when the electric field is very large, or when electron-impurity\nscattering is very weak. The quantum kinetic equation for the density matrix of\nnoninteracting electrons is exactly and analytically solvable, reducing to a\nproblem of spin dynamics for \"unpaired\" electrons near the Fermi surface. The\ncrucial parameter is $\\gamma=eEL_s/E_F$, where $E$ is the electric field, $e$\nis the absolute value of the electron charge, $E_F$ is the Fermi energy, and\n$L_s = \\hbar/(2m\\alpha)$ is the spin-precession length in the Rashba spin-orbit\nfield with coupling strength $\\alpha$. If $\\gamma\\ll1$ the evolution of the\nspin is adiabatic, resulting in a spin polarization that grows monotonically in\ntime and eventually saturates at the maximum value $n(\\alpha/v_F)$, where $n$\nis the electron density and $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. If $\\gamma \\gg 1$ the\nevolution of the spin becomes strongly non-adiabatic and the spin polarization\nis progressively reduced, and eventually suppressed for $\\gamma\\to \\infty$. We\nalso predict an inverse nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which an electric\ncurrent is driven by a magnetic field that grows linearly in time. The\n\"conductivities\" for the direct and the inverse effect satisfy generalized\nOnsager reciprocity relations, which reduce to the standard ones in the linear\nresponse regime.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 7 figures"]}]

Traditionally, estimates of running times of such sampling algorithms\nare computed using the number of steps in the chain needed to reach the\nstationary distribution. This quantity is generally defined as mixing time and\nis often difficult to compute. In this paper, we suggest an alternative\nestimate based on the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, by establishing a link between\nthe maximization of KSE and the minimization of the mixing time. Since KSE are\neasier to compute in general than mixing time, this link provides a new faster\nmethod to approximate the minimum mixing time that could be interesting in\ncomputer sciences and statistical physics. Beyond this, our finding will also\nbe of interest to the out-of-equilibrium community, by providing a new rational\nto select stationary states in out-of-equilibrium physics: it seems reasonable\nthat in a physical system with two simultaneous equiprobable possible dynamics,\nthe final stationary state will be closer to the stationary state corresponding\nto the fastest dynamics (smallest mixing time).Through the empirical link found\nin this letter, this state will correspond to a state of maximal\nKolmogorov-Sinai entropy.

The uncertainty emerges from number\nfluctuations, called genetic drift, arising in the small number of particularly\nfit individuals of the population. Random genetic drift in this evolutionary\nvanguard also limits the speed of adaptation, which diverges in deterministic\nmodels that ignore these chance effects. Several approaches have been developed\nto analyze the crucial role of noise on the expected dynamics of adaptation,\nincluding the mean fitness of the entire population, or the fate of newly\narising beneficial deleterious mutations. However, very little is known about\nhow genetic drift causes fluctuations to emerge on the population level,\nincluding fitness distribution variations and speed variations.

This constraint regulates (rather\nthan fixes) the population size, accounting for resource limitations. The\nresulting linear equations, which can be accurately solved numerically, exhibit\nfluctuation-induced terms that amplify short-distance correlations and suppress\nlong-distance ones.

For a nonnegative\ninteger $k$, $B_k$-EPG graphs are defined as EPG graphs admitting a model in\nwhich each path has at most $k$ bends.
