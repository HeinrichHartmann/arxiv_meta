This allows us to generalize the model to account\nfor variation in people's propensity to know people in particular subgroups\n(barrier effects), such as their tendency to know people like themselves, as\nwell as their lack of awareness of or reluctance to acknowledge their contacts'\ngroup memberships (transmission bias).

More precisely, the\nproblem is to determine the asymptotics of the expectation (and the variance)\nof $T_{m}(N)$, as well as its limit distribution, as the number $N$ of\ndifferent coupons becomes arbitrarily large. The classical case of the problem,\nnamely the case of equal coupon probabilities, is here extended to the general\ncase, where the probabilities of the selected coupons are unequal.\n  In the beginning of the article we give a brief review of the formulas for\nthe moments and the moment generating function of the random variable\n$T_{m}(N)$.

The $Q$ subspace must be treated using the concepts of non-Hermitian\nphysics, and of particular interest here is: the capacity of the environment to\nmediate a coupling between the different states of $Q$; the role played by the\npresence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectra of OQSs; the influence of\nEPs on the rigidity of the wavefunction phases, and; the ability of EPs to\ninitiate a dynamical phase transition (DPT). DPTs occur when the quantum\ndynamics of the open system causes transitions between non-analytically\nconnected states, as a function of some external control parameter. In addition\nto discussing experiments on mesoscopic quantum point contacts, we also review\nmanifestations of DPTs in mesoscopic devices and other systems.

Compiling data from {\\it WISE} and {\\it Akari}, we confirm that\nthe periodic behavior reported in the optical light curve from Graham et al.\n(2015) is reproduced at infrared wavelengths, with best-fit observed-frame 3.4\nand $4.6 \\mu$m time lags of $(2219 \\pm 153, 2408 \\pm 148)$ days for a near\nface-on orientation of the torus, or $(4103\\pm 153, 4292 \\pm 148)$ days for an\ninclined system with relativistic Doppler boosting in effect. The periodicity\nin the infrared light curves and the light-travel time of the accretion disk\nphotons to reach the dust glowing regions support that a source within the\naccretion disk is responsible for the optical variability of PG 1302-102,\nechoed at the further out dusty regions.

It is generally assumed that high-resolution data\nare needed to extract meaningful behavioural patterns, which potentially limits\nthe application of this approach. Obtaining high-resolution movement data\ncontinues to be an economic and technical challenge, particularly for animals\nthat live in social groups. Here, we test whether accurate movement behaviour\ncan be extracted from data that possesses increasingly lower temporal\nresolution. To do so, we use a modified version of force matching, in which\nsimulated forces acting on a focal animal are compared to observed movement\ndata. We show that useful information can be extracted from sparse data. We\napply this approach to a sparse movement dataset collected on the adult members\nof a troop of baboons in the DeHoop Nature Reserve, South Africa.

Using data from a focal\nanimal, our data provide support for both hypothesis, with stronger support for\nthe latter. Although the focal animal was found to be sensitive to the group,\nthis occurred only on a small number of occasions when the group as a whole was\nhighly clustered as a single entity away from the focal animal. We suggest that\nspecific social interactions may thus drive overall group cohesion.

We formalise\nthe basic single-particle operations as statements in the language, and then\nshow that the second law must be satisfied by any composition of these basic\noperations. This is done by finding a computational invariant of the system. We\nshow, furthermore, that this invariant requires an erasure cost to exist within\nthe system, equal to kTln2 for a bit of information: Landauer Erasure becomes a\ntheorem of the formal system. The Norton-Ladyman controversy can therefore be\nresolved in a rigorous fashion, and moreover the formalism we introduce gives a\nset of reasoning tools for further analysis of Landauer erasure, which are\nprovably consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.\n","Comment: In Proceedings QPL 2015, arXiv:1511.01181.

Many\nsystems today maintain models for the foreground as well as the background, and\nthese models compete to explain the pixels in a video. In this paper, we argue\nthat the logical endpoint of this evolution is to simply use Bayes' rule to\nclassify pixels.

A simple\napplication of Bayes' rule then gives a posterior probability over the label.\nThe only remaining question is the quality of the component models: the\nbackground likelihood, the foreground likelihood, and the prior.

This\nresults in pulses alternating between a dispersion that is either affected by a\ncloud or not. The resulting spectrum of the signal can be related to the\nelectron density sampled by the pulse that propagates through the cloud. By\nvarying the delay of the launch of the pulse with respect to the train passage,\none can map the cloud density at different points behind the train.\n"]}]

Thus, it is appealing to\nseek a middle ground between these two extremes: a synchronization mechanism\nthat relieves the programmer of the overhead of reasoning about data conflicts\nthat may arise from concurrent operations without severely limiting the\nprogram's performance. The \\emph{Transactional Memory (TM)} abstraction is\nproposed as such a mechanism: it intends to combine an easy-to-use programming\ninterface with an efficient utilization of the concurrent-computing abilities\nprovided by multicore architectures. TM allows the programmer to\n\\emph{speculatively} execute sequences of shared-memory operations as\n\\emph{atomic transactions} with \\emph{all-or-nothing} semantics: the\ntransaction can either \\emph{commit}, in which case it appears as executed\nsequentially, or \\emph{abort}, in which case its update operations do not take\neffect. Thus, the programmer can design software having only sequential\nsemantics in mind and let TM take care, at run-time, of resolving the conflicts\nin concurrent executions.\n  Intuitively, we want TMs to allow for as much \\emph{concurrency} as possible:\nin the absence of severe data conflicts, transactions should be able to\nprogress in parallel.

The MSGP framework enables the use of Gaussian processes (GPs)\non billions of datapoints, without requiring distributed inference, or severe\nassumptions. In particular, MSGP reduces the standard $O(n^3)$ complexity of GP\nlearning and inference to $O(n)$, and the standard $O(n^2)$ complexity per test\npoint prediction to $O(1)$. MSGP involves 1) decomposing covariance matrices as\nKronecker products of Toeplitz matrices approximated by circulant matrices.\nThis multi-level circulant approximation allows one to unify the orthogonal\ncomputational benefits of fast Kronecker and Toeplitz approaches, and is\nsignificantly faster than either approach in isolation; 2) local kernel\ninterpolation and inducing points to allow for arbitrarily located data inputs,\nand $O(1)$ test time predictions; 3) exploiting block-Toeplitz Toeplitz-block\nstructure (BTTB), which enables fast inference and learning when\nmultidimensional Kronecker structure is not present; and 4) projections of the\ninput space to flexibly model correlated inputs and high dimensional data. The\nability to handle many ($m \\approx n$) inducing points allows for near-exact\naccuracy and large scale kernel learning.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 9 figures"]}]

In\ncontrast to most of the work in this field, which starts with a model for a\nfinite number of observations and considers the asymptotic properties of\nestimators and designs as the sample size converges to infinity, our approach\nis based on a continuous time model. We use results from stochastic anal- ysis\nto identify the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) in this model. Based on\nthe BLUE, we construct an efficient linear estimator and corresponding optimal\ndesigns in the model for finite sample size by minimizing the mean squared\nerror between the opti- mal solution in the continuous time model and its\ndiscrete approximation with respect to the weights (of the linear estimator)\nand the optimal design points, in particular in the multi-parameter case. In\ncontrast to previous work on the subject the resulting estimators and\ncorresponding optimal designs are very efficient and easy to implement. This\nmeans that they are practi- cally not distinguishable from the weighted least\nsquares estimator and the corresponding optimal designs, which have to be found\nnumerically by non-convex discrete optimization. The advantages of the new\napproach are illustrated in several numerical examples.\n","Comment: Keywords and Phrases: linear regression, correlated observations,\n  optimal design, Gaussian white mouse model, Doob representation, quadrature\n  formulas AMS Subject classification: Primary 62K05; Secondary: 62M05"]}]
