Considering radiative possibility in the motion, the\nvariation formalism is reviewed for the optimization of overall action involved\nin the dynamic passage of a radiating particle in external field in a\npreselected time interval. The resultant dynamics is described by a family of\npaths governed by the usual local forces including radiation reaction and\nadditionally, by a nonlocal force originating from coordinated evolution of the\nfamily. The measure of optimum radiation action taken on the basis of shortest\npath displacement in the time interval establishes the norms of the coordinated\nevolution. The norms involve dynamic correlations of local properties with\nnonlocal ones and reveal interplay of quantized action in the energy-momentum\nevolution of the field-particle system. In the delocalized description, the\nclassical features could be conceived as canonical average of the nonlocal\nnorms and the radiative dynamics no more suffers from acceleration runaway\nproblem. The dynamics now entails the incessant safeguarding action of the\nnonlocal force against any perturbing stress from external fields; external\ntorsion stress reaching a critical value can lead to reduction or collapse of\nthe coherent evolution. Criterion of the coherence, criticality for the\nchangeover of quantum states, and promptness in the reduction of state wave\nvectors could be defined objectively with the mechanical description. Quantum\nevent resulting from state vector reduction of the field-particle system\nmaterializes through transfer of the torsion stress to the vacuum polarized\nstructure existing around the accelerating charge and then relieve of stress\nthrough dissipation at the rate proportional to fourth power of the\nacceleration.\n","Comment: 26 pages"]}]

These differences coupled with environmental\nfluctuations in demographic rates can have subtle effects on population\npersistence and species coexistence. To understand these effects, we provide a\ngeneral theory for coexistence of structured, interacting species living in a\nstochastic environment. The theory is applicable to nonlinear, multi species\nmatrix models with stochastically varying parameters. The theory relies on\nlong-term growth rates of species corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov\nexponents of random matrix products. Our coexistence criterion requires that a\nconvex combination of these long-term growth rates is positive with probability\none whenever one or more species are at low density. When this condition holds,\nthe community is stochastically persistent: the fraction of time that a species\ndensity goes below $\\delta>0$ approaches zero as $\\delta$ approaches zero.\nApplications to predator-prey interactions in an autocorrelated environment, a\nstochastic LPA model, and spatial lottery models are provided. These\napplications demonstrate that positive autocorrelations in temporal\nfluctuations can disrupt predator-prey coexistence, fluctuations in\nlog-fecundity can facilitate persistence in structured populations, and\nlong-lived, relatively sedentary competing populations are likely to coexist in\nspatially and temporally heterogenous environments.\n","Comment: 41 pages, 3 figures; Accepted for publication in Journal of\n  Mathematical Biology"]}]

Fluid turbulence is a typical\nexample - while turbulent mixing seems to increase entropy, a variety of\nsustained vortical structures can emerge. In Hamiltonian formalism, some\ntopological constraints are represented by Casimir invariants (for example,\nhelicities of a fluid or a plasma), and then, the effective phase space is\nreduced to the Casimir leaves.

The central gas depletion has been attributed\nto a possible head-on collision 200 Myr ago, supported by the existence of an\noffset inner ring of warm dust. We present new IRAM 30m radio telescope\nobservations of the molecular gas in the central region, and the detection of\nCO and its isotopes $^{13}$CO(2-1) and C$^{18}$O(2-1), together with the dense\ngas tracers, HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0). A systematic study of the observed peak\ntemperatures with non-LTE equilibrium simulations shows that the detected lines\ntrace dense regions with n$_{H_2}$ in the range 2.5 $10^4 - 5.6 10^5$\ncm$^{-3}$, while the gas is very clumpy with a beam filling factor of 0.5-2\n10$^{-2}$. This is compatible with the dust mass derived from the far-infrared\nemission, assuming a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 0.01 with a typical clump size\nof 2 pc. We also show that the gas is optically thin in all lines except for\n$^{12}$CO(1-0) and $^{12}$CO(2-1), CO lines are close to their thermal\nequilibrium condition at 17.5-20 K, the molecular hydrogen density is larger\nthan critical and HCN and HCO+ lines have a subthermal excitation temperature\nof 9 K with a density smaller than critical.

The fact that the optically thin $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O lines have\ncomparable intensities means that the secondary element $^{13}$C is depleted\nwith respect to the primary $^{12}$C, as is expected just after a recent star\nformation.

Method: FT-RHFB equations are solved in a Dirac Woods-Saxon (DWS) basis\nconsidering two kinds of pairing interactions: finite or zero range.

We forward a picture of winds whereby cool\nclouds are initially accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot flow, but are\nrapidly shredded by hydrodynamical instabilities, thereby increasing beta,\nseeding radiative and thermal instability, and cool gas rebirth. If the cooled\nwind shocks as it sweeps up the circumgalactic medium, its cooling time is\nshort, thus depositing cool gas far out into the halo.

This\ndramatic environmental effect is generally not taken into account in the SFHs\nusually assumed to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of these\ngalaxies, yielding to a poor fit of their stellar emission and, consequently, a\nbiased estimate of the SFR. We aim at reproducing the SFH of galaxies that\nunderwent a rapid star formation quenching using a truncated delayed SFH that\nwe implemented in the SED fitting code CIGALE. We show that the ratio between\nthe instantaneous SFR and the SFR just before the quenching ($r_{SFR}$) is well\nconstrained as long as rest frame UV data are available. This SED modelling is\napplied to the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) containing isolated galaxies and\nsources falling in the dense environment of the Virgo cluster. The latter are\nHI-deficient due to ram pressure stripping. We show that the truncated delayed\nSFH successfully reproduces their SED while typical SFH assumptions fail. A\ngood correlation is found between $r_{SFR}$ and HI-def, the parameter\nquantifying the gas deficiency of cluster galaxies, meaning that SED fitting\nresults can be used to provide a tentative estimate of the gas deficiency of\ngalaxies for which HI observations are not available. The HRS galaxies are\nplaced on the SFR-$M_*$ diagram showing that the HI-deficient sources lie in\nthe quiescent region confirming previous studies. Using the $r_{SFR}$\nparameter, we derive the SFR of these sources before quenching and show that\nthey were previously on the main sequence relation. We show that the $r_{SFR}$\nparameter is also well recovered for deeply obscured high redshift sources, as\nwell as in absence of IR data. SED fitting is thus a powerful tool to identify\ngalaxies that underwent a rapid star formation quenching.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in A&A. 13 pages, 14 figures"]}]

An accurate determination of the spectrum of\nflare energized electrons over a broad energy range is crucial for our\nunderstanding of aspects such as the acceleration mechanism and the total flare\nenergy. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the kappa-distribution as\nrepresentation of the total spectrum of flare accelerated electrons. In this\nwork we present the kappa-distribution as a differential emission measure. This\nallows for inferring the electron distribution from X-ray observations and EUV\nobservations by simultaneously fitting the proposed function to RHESSI and\nSDO/AIA data. This yields the spatially integrated electron spectra of a\ncoronal source between less than 0.1 keV up to several tens of keV. The method\nis applied to a single-loop GOES C4.1 flare. The results show that the total\nenergy can only be determined accurately by combining RHESSI and AIA\nobservations. Simultaneously fitting the proposed representation of the\nkappa-distribution reduces the electron number density in the analyzed flare by\na factor of ~30 and the total flare energy by a factor of ~5 compared with the\ncommonly used fitting of RHESSI spectra. The spatially integrated electron\nspectrum of the investigated flare between 0.043 keV and 24 keV is consistent\nwith the combination of a low-temperature (~2 MK) component and a hot (~11 MK)\nkappa-like component with spectral index 4, reminiscent of solar wind\ndistributions.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 7 figures, ApJ, accepted"]}]

Yet, the bipolar radio jets of 1E 1740.7-2942 are\nvery reminiscent of a radio galaxy. The true nature of the object has thus\nremained an open question for nearly a quarter of a century. Aims. Our main\ngoal here is to confirm the Galactic membership of 1E 1740.7-2942 by searching\nfor morphological changes of its extended radio jets in human timescales. This\nwork was triggered as a result of recent positive detection of fast structural\nchanges in the large-scale jets of its 'twin' GRS 1758-258. Methods. We carried\nout an in-depth exploration of the VLA public archives and fully recalibrated\nall 1E 1740.7-2942 extended data sets in the C configuration of the array. We\nobtained and analyzed matching beam radio maps for five epochs, covering years\n1992, 1993, 1994, 1997 and 2000, with an angular resolution of a few\narcseconds. Results. We clearly detected structural changes in the arcminute\njets of 1E 1740.7-2942 on timescales of roughly a year, which set a firm\ndistance upper limit of 12 kpc. Moreover, a simple precessing model was\nsimultaneously fitted to the five observing epochs available. The observed\nchanges in the jet flow are strongly suggestive of a precession period of ~1.3\nyears. Conclusions. The fitting of the precession model to the data yields a\ndistance of ~5 kpc. This value, and the observed changes, rule out any\nremaining doubts about the 1E 1740.7-2942 Galactic nature. To our knowledge,\nthis microquasar is the second whose jet precession ephemeris become available\nafter SS433. This kind of information is relevant to the physics of compact\nobjects, since the genesis of the precession phenomenon occurs very close to\nthe interplay region between the accretion disk and the compact object in the\nsystem.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Astrophysics"]}]

However, large parallel communication costs\noften limit parallel scalability. As the multigrid hierarchy is formed, each\ncoarse matrix is formed through a triple matrix product.

Second, we\nestablish an improved complexity bound of Coordinate Gradient Descent (CGD) for\ngeneral convex problems which can match that of GD in certain scenarios. Our\nbounds are sharper than the known bounds as they are always at least $K$ times\nworse than GD.

Despite the recent burst of interest in recovering\ncommunities in the SBM from statistical and computational points of view, there\nare still gaps in understanding the fundamental information theoretic and\ncomputational limits of recovery. In this paper, we consider the SBM in its\nfull generality, where there is no restriction on the number and sizes of\ncommunities or how they grow with the number of nodes, as well as on the\nconnection probabilities inside or across communities. This generality allows\nus to move past the artifacts of homogenous SBM, and understand the right\nparameters (such as the relative densities of communities) that define the\nvarious recovery thresholds. We outline the implications of our generalizations\nvia a set of illustrative examples. For instance, $\\log n$ is considered to be\nthe standard lower bound on the cluster size for exact recovery via convex\nmethods, for homogenous SBM. We show that it is possible, in the right\ncircumstances (when sizes are spread and the smaller the cluster, the denser),\nto recover very small clusters (up to $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ size), if there are just\na few of them (at most polylogarithmic in $n$).\n","Comment: 1 figure"]}]

We order these bitableaux by suitably defined lexicographic order\nand denote the bitableau that is least in this order as the standard\nrepresentation for the associated graph. The standard representation\ncharacterizes graphs uniquely. The second characterization is obtained in terms\nof associated rooted, unordered, pseudo trees. We show that the isomorphism of\ntwo given graphs is implied by the isomorphism of their associated pseudo\ntrees. The third characterization is obtained in terms of ordered adjacency\nlists to be associated with two given labeled graphs. We show the two given\nlabeled graphs are isomorphic if and only if their associated ordered adjacency\nlists can be made identical by the action of suitable transpositions on any one\nof these lists. We discuss in brief the complexity of these characterizations\ndescribed in this paper for deciding isomorphism of graphs.
