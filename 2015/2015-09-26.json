Here, we\ndesigned and synthesized two D-A type molecules, TPA-TAZ and TCP. The OLEDs\nbased on them exhibit deep-blue emission and the singlet formation ratios are\nhigher than the simple spin-statistics of 25 %. Specially, a TPA-TAZ-based OLED\nachieves a maximum EQE of 6.8 %, which is the largest value of the undoped\nOLEDs with CIE(y)< 0.06 (the EBU blue standard) up to date. Comprehensive\nexperiments eliminate the triplet-harvesting processes of thermally activated\ndelayed fluorescence and triplet-triplet annihilation. Instead, the\ntriplet-polaron interaction induced upconversion from triplet to singlet\nthrough one-electron transfer mechanism is proposed, and proven by the\nmagneto-current measurement and quantum chemistry computation. Our results may\noffer a new route to break through the 25 % upper limit of IQE of fluorescent\nOLEDs, especially, the deep-blue fluorescent OLEDs.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures"]}]
