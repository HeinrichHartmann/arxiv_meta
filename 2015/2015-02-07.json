The statistical nature of the intrinsic\nCMB signal makes it essential to minimize the systematic errors in the CMB\ntemperature determinations. The feasibility of using simple neural networks to\nextract the CMB signal from detailed simulated data has already been\ndemonstrated. Here, simple neural networks are applied to the WMAP 5yr\ntemperature data without using any auxiliary data. A simple \\emph{multilayer\nperceptron} neural network with two hidden layers provides temperature\nestimates over more than 75 per cent of the sky with random errors\nsignificantly below those previously extracted from these data. Also, the\nsystematic errors, i.e.\\ errors correlated with the Galactic foregrounds, are\nvery small. With these results the neural network method is well prepared for\ndealing with the high - quality CMB data from the ESA Planck Surveyor\nsatellite.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 13 figures"]}]
