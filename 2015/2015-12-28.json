We consider supersymmetric compactifications to\nfour-dimensional maximally symmetric space, commonly referred to as the\nStrominger system. The compact part of space-time $X$ is a six-dimensional\nmanifold of what we refer to as a heterotic $SU(3)$-structure. We show that\nthis system can be put in terms of a holomorphic operator $\\bar D$ on a bundle\n$\\mathcal{Q}=T^*X\\oplus\\mathrm{End}(TX)\\oplus\\mathrm{End}(V)\\oplus TX$, defined\nby a series of extensions. We proceed to compute the infinitesimal deformation\nspace of this structure, given by $T\\mathcal{M}=H^{(0,1)}(\\mathcal{Q})$, which\nconstitutes the infinitesimal spectrum of the four-dimensional theory. In doing\nso, we find an over counting of moduli by $H^{(0,1)}(\\mathrm{End}(TX))$, which\ncan be reinterpreted as $\\mathcal{O}(\\alpha')$ field redefinitions. We next\nconsider non-maximally symmetric domain wall compactifications of the form\n$M_{10}=M_3\\times Y$, where $M_3$ is three-dimensional Minkowski space, and\n$Y=\\mathbb{R}\\times X$ is a seven-dimensional non-compact manifold with a\n$G_2$-structure. Here $X$ is a six dimensional compact space of half-flat\n$SU(3)$-structure, non-trivially fibered over $\\mathbb{R}$. By focusing on\ncoset compactifications, we show that the compact space $X$ can be endowed with\nnon-trivial torsion, which can be used in a combination with $\\alpha'$-effects\nto stabilise all geometric moduli. The domain wall can further be lifted to a\nmaximally symmetric AdS vacuum by inclusion of non-perturbative effects.\nFinally, we consider domain wall compactifications where $X$ is a Calabi-Yau.\nWe show that by considering such compactifications, one can evade the usual\nno-go theorems for flux in Calabi-Yau compactifications, allowing flux to be\nused as a tool in such compactifications, even when $X$ is K\\\"ahler.\n","Comment: PhD thesis. 163 pages, 5 figures.

They\nare therefore often substituted by concentration measurements of odorous\nsubstances. Then a conversion of the chemical concentrations C (mg m-3) into\nodour concentrations COD (ouE m-3) and odour intensities OI is necessary. Four\nmethods to convert the concentrations of single substances to the odour\nconcentrations and odour intensities of an odorous mixture are investigated:\n(1) direct use of measured concentrations, (2) the sum of the odour activity\nvalue SOAV, (3) the sum of the odour intensities SOI, and (4) the equivalent\nodour concentration EOC, as a new method. The methods are evaluated with\nolfactometric measurements of seven substances as well as their mixtures. The\nresults indicate that the SOI and EOC conversion methods deliver reliable\nvalues. These methods use not only the odour threshold concentration but also\nthe slope of the Weber-Fechner law to include the sensitivity of the odour\nperception of the individual substances. They fulfil the criteria of an\nobjective conversion without the need of a further calibration by additional\nolfactometric measurements.\n","Comment: accepted for publication on Dec. 20, 2015, Atmospheric Environment\n  (2016)"]}]
