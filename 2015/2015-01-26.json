In such problems, our goal is to minimize the cost of\nresources used to perform a certain task. The cost of resources grows\nsuperlinearly, as $x^q$, $q\\ge 1$, with the amount $x$ of resources used. We\ndefine a novel linear programming relaxation for such problems, and then show\nthat the integrality gap of the relaxation is $A_q$, where $A_q$ is the $q$-th\nmoment of the Poisson random variable with parameter 1. Using our framework, we\nobtain approximation algorithms for the Minimum Energy Efficient Routing,\nMinimum Degree Balanced Spanning Tree, Load Balancing on Unrelated Parallel\nMachines, and Unrelated Parallel Machine Scheduling with Nonlinear Functions of\nCompletion Times problems.\n  Our analysis relies on the decoupling inequality for nonnegative random\nvariables.

Solutions of these constraints are test\ninputs for the program, including an initial content for the database.

We show that for realistic\nparameters, hydrogen atoms with a velocity up to 600 m/s can be stored in a\n1-meter diameter ring, which implies that the atoms can be injected in the ring\ndirectly from a pulsed supersonic beam source. This ring can be used to study\ncollisions between stored hydrogen atoms and molecular beams of many different\natoms and molecules. The advantage of using a synchrotron is two-fold: (i) the\ncollision partners move in the same direction as the stored atoms, resulting in\na small relative velocity and thus a low collision energy, and (ii) by storing\natoms for many round-trips, the sensitivity to collisions is enhanced by a\nfactor of 100-1000. In the proposed ring, the cross-sections for collisions\nbetween hydrogen, the most abundant atom in the universe, with any atom or\nmolecule that can be put in a beam, including He, H$_2$, CO, ammonia and OH can\nbe measured at energies below 100 K. We discuss the possibility to use optical\ntransitions to load hydrogen atoms into the ring without influencing the atoms\nthat are already stored. In this way it will be possible to reach high\ndensities of stored hydrogen atoms.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures"]}]
