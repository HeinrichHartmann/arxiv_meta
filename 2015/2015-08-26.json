The\nFIR deadbeat observer is shown to be more reliable than the SDFT methods, an\nIIR variant is presented, and ways of fine-tuning its response are discussed. A\nnovel technique for stabilizing IIR SDFT analyzers with a fading memory, so\nthat all poles are inside the unit circle, is also derived. Slepian and\nsum-of-cosine windows are adapted to improve the frequency responses for the\nvarious FIR and IIR DFT methods.\n","Comment: To appear in Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers (JCSC).\n  Accepted draft version, Aug. 2015.

Here we expand the\npoint made by Murphy (2013) that in the case of some interacting star-forming\ngalaxies there is a non-thermal emission from the gas bridge in between them,\nwhich might cause a dispersion in this correlation. Galactic interactions and\nmergers have been known to give rise to tidal shocks and disrupt morphologies\nespecially in the smaller of the interacting components. Here we point out that\nthese shocks can also heat the gas and dust and will inevitably accelerate\nparticles and result in a tidal cosmic-ray population in addition to standard\ngalactic cosmic rays in the galaxy itself. This would result in a non-thermal\nemission not only from the gas bridges of interacting systems, but from\ninteracting galaxies as a whole in general. Thus both tidal heating and\nadditional non-thermal radiation will obviously affect the FIR-radio\ncorrelation of these systems, the only question is how much. In this scenario\nthe FIR-radio correlation is not stable in interacting galaxies, but rather\nevolves as the interaction/merger progresses. To test this hypothesis and probe\nthe possible impact of tidal cosmic ray population we have analyzed a sample of\n43 infrared bright star-forming interacting galaxies at different merger\nstages.

Many processes have been advocated as responsible for\nsuch a trend (also known as mass quenching), e.g., feedback from active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs), and the formation of classical bulges. We determine a\nrefined star formation versus stellar mass relation in the local Universe.

By complementing this local determination\nwith high-redshift measurements from the literature, we reconstruct the star\nformation history of main-sequence galaxies as a function of stellar mass from\nthe present epoch up to z=3. In agreement with previous studies, our analysis\nshows that quenching mechanisms occur above a threshold stellar mass M_knee\nthat evolves with redshift as propto (1+z)^{2}. Moreover, visual morphological\nclassification of individual objects in our local sample reveals a sharp\nincrease in the fraction of visually-classified strong bars with mass, hinting\nthat strong bars may contribute to the observed downturn in the sSFR above\nM_knee. We test this hypothesis using a simple but physically-motivated\nnumerical model for bar formation, finding that strong bars can rapidly quench\nstar formation in the central few kpc of field galaxies. We conclude that\nstrong bars contribute significantly to the red colors observed in the inner\nparts of massive galaxies, although additional mechanisms are likely required\nto quench the star formation in the outer regions of massive spiral galaxies.\nIntriguingly, when we extrapolate our model to higher redshifts, we\nsuccessfully recover the observed redshift evolution for M_knee.\n","Comment: accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

The origin of the chemical abundances of these\nCEMP-$s$ stars is believed to be accretion in the past of enriched material\nfrom a primary star in the AGB phase. We investigate the mechanism of mass\ntransfer and the process of nucleosynthesis in low-metallicity AGB stars by\nmodelling the binary systems in which the observed CEMP-$s$ stars were formed.\nFor this purpose we compare a sample of $67$ CEMP-$s$ stars with a grid of\nbinary stars generated by our binary evolution and nucleosynthesis model. We\nclassify our sample CEMP-$s$ stars in three groups based on the observed\nabundance of europium. In CEMP$-s/r$ stars the europium-to-iron ratio is more\nthan ten times higher than in the Sun, whereas it is lower than this threshold\nin CEMP$-s/nr$ stars. No measurement of europium is currently available for\nCEMP-$s/ur$ stars. On average our models reproduce well the abundances observed\nin CEMP-$s/nr$ stars, whereas in CEMP-$s/r$ stars and CEMP-$s/ur$ stars the\nabundances of the light-$s$ elements are systematically overpredicted by our\nmodels and in CEMP-$s/r$ stars the abundances of the heavy-$s$ elements are\nunderestimated. In all stars our modelled abundances of sodium overestimate the\nobservations. This discrepancy is reduced only in models that underestimate the\nabundances of most of the $s$-elements.

This paper provides a\nqualitative introduction to a new method based on KAM theory for investigating\nthe morphology of regular and irregular orbits based on direct computation of\ntori described in Paper 1 and applies it to a galaxy disc bar. Using this\nmethod, we find that much of the phase space inside of the bar radius becomes\nchaotic for strong bars, excepting a small region in phase space between the\nILR and corotation resonances for orbits of moderate ellipticity. This helps\nexplain the preponderance of moderately eccentric bar-supporting orbits as the\nbar strength increases. This also suggests that bar strength may be limited by\nchaos! The chaos results from stochastic layers that form around primary\nresonances owing to separatrix splitting. Most investigations of orbit\nregularity are performed using numerical computation of Lyapunov exponents or\nrelated indices. We show that Lyapunov exponents poorly diagnose the degree of\nstochasticity in this problem; the island structure in the stochastic sheaths\nallow orbit to change morphology while presenting anomalously small Lyapunov\nexponent values (i.e. weak chaos).

Our general aim is to\ndescribe and quantify the apparent \"latticelike\" microarchitecture of the\ntrabecular bone network.\n  Methods: Similar in some ways to the topological node-strut analysis\nintroduced by Garrahan et al. [J. Microsc. 142, 341-349 (1986)], our method is\ndistinguished by an emphasis on long-range trabecular connectivity. Thus, while\nthe topological classification of a pixel (after skeletonization) as a node,\nstrut, or terminus, can be determined from the 3x3 neighborhood of that pixel,\nour method, which does not involve skeletonization, takes into account a much\nlarger neighborhood. In addition, rather than giving a discrete classification\nof each pixel as a node, strut, or terminus, our method produces a continuous\nvariable, node strength. The node strength is averaged over a region of\ninterest to produce the mean node strength of the region.\n  Results: We have applied our long range node-strut analysis to a set of 26\nhigh-resolution ... The Nd/Tm ratios were computed using traditional\nhistomorphometry performed on bone biopsies obtained at the same location as\nthe pQCT scans.\n  Conclusions: The newly introduced morphometric measure allows a quantitative\nassessment of the long-range connectivity of trabecular bone. One advantage of\nthis method is that it is based on pQCT images that can be obtained\nnoninvasively from patients, i.e., without having to obtain a bone biopsy from\nthe patient.\n"]}]

This goes against the\ncurrent intuition that instances of density 1 are the hardest, and therefore is\na step toward answering the open question in the affirmative. Our results stem\nfrom novel combinations of earlier algorithms for Subset Sum and a study of an\nextremal question in additive combinatorics connected to the problem of\nUniquely Decodable Code Pairs in information theory.\n","Comment: 14 pages"]}]

Here, it is shown that these\ndeviations are related to the power spectrum of the bath. Specifically, it is\nshown that the system thermal-equilibrium-state cannot be characterized by the\ncanonical Boltzmann's distribution in quantum mechanics. This is because the\nuncertainty principle imposed a lower bound of the dispersion of the total\nenergy of the system that is dominated by the spectral density of the bath.\nHowever, in the classical case, for a wide class of systems that interact via\ncentral forces with pairwise-self-interacting environment, the system thermal\nequilibrium state is exactly characterized by the canonical Boltzmann\ndistribution. As a consequence of this analysis and taking into account all\nenergy scales in the system and reservoir interaction, an effective coupling to\nthe environment is introduced. Sample computations in different regimes\npredicted by this effective coupling are shown. Specifically, in the strong\ncoupling effective regime, the system exhibits deviations from standard\nthermodynamics and in the weak coupling effective regime, quantum features such\nas stationary entanglement are possible at high temperatures. Moreover, it is\nknown that the spectrum of thermal baths depends on the non-Markovian\ncharacter. Hence, non-Markovian interactions have a important role in the\nthermal equilibrium state of physical systems. For example, in quantum\noptomechanics is looked up to cool the mechanical system through an auxiliary\nsystem which generally is a cavity. This cooling process takes into account the\nnon-Markovian interaction and as it is shown here, it is more effective than if\nwe use only the Markovian approximation in the equation of motion for the\ndifferent modes.\n","Comment: Master Thesis"]}]

Namely, we advocate\nand deploy extensive synapse detection on the entire antennal lobe (AL)\nneuropil in the brain of the fruit fly Drosophila, a region much larger than\nany densely annotated to date. The resulting synapse point cloud produced is\ninvaluable for determining compartment boundaries in the AL and choosing\nspecific regions for subsequent analysis. We introduce our methodology in this\npaper for region selection and show both manual and automatic synapse\nannotation results. Finally, we note the correspondence between image datasets\nobtained using the synaptic marker, antibody nc82, and our datasets enabling\nregistration between light and EM image modalities.\n"]}]

New data from Voyager from 5-60 MeV beyond the heliopause\nis used along with high energy data from the PAMELA, FERMI and AMS-2\ninstruments in Earth orbit. Using a Monte Carlo diffusion model for galactic\npropagation we obtain a source rigidity spectrum with a spectral index =-2.25\nindependent of energy below 10 GeV, possibly steepening above 10 GeV to 2.40 at\nthe highest energies. This spectrum will fit the electron data over 5 orders of\nmagnitude to within + 10% at both low and high energies. This steepening of the\nelectron source spectrum could be an important feature of the acceleration\nprocess, e.g., synchrotron loss during acceleration could steepen the source\nspectrum. This fit requires only a single break in the rigidity dependence of\nthe diffusion coefficient by ~1.0 power in the exponent at about 1.0 GV. The\ncalculations also predict the distribution of electrons perpendicular to the\ngalactic disk. The galaxy does act as a calorimeter for electrons in the energy\nrange 0.1-10 GeV where ~80% of the electrons are trapped. At higher energies\nthe electrons escape the galactic disk rapidly. At energies ~1 TEV the\nelectrons loose most of their energy by synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission within < 0.5 Kpc of their origin near the galactic equator. At\nenergies < 0.1 GeV, because of the increase in the diffusion coefficient below\n~1 GV, and the absence of other significant loss processes, the electrons\nescape and form a difficult to detect, but important galactic halo population.\n","Comment: 18 pages,5 figures"]}]
