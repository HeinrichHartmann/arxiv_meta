The article is organized as: (I) Definition; (II)\nRegression Models; (III) Discussion. Additionally, I discovered a unique\ninteraction between GDP and GCEGI in both the short-run and the long-run and\nprovided policy makers with some suggestions. For example in the short run, GDP\nresponded positively and very significantly (0.00248) to GCEGI, while GCEGI\nreacted positively but not too significantly (0.08051) to GDP. In the long run,\ncurrent GDP responded negatively and permanently (0.09229) to a shock in past\nGCEGI, while current GCEGI reacted negatively yet temporarily (0.29821) to a\nshock in past GDP. Therefore, policy makers should not adjust current GCEGI\nbased merely on the condition of current and past GDP. Although increasing\nGCEGI does help GDP in the short-term, significantly abrupt increase in GCEGI\nmight not be good to the long-term health of GDP. Instead, a balanced,\nsustainable, and economically viable solution is recommended, so that the\nshort-term benefits to the current economy from increasing GCEGI often largely\nsecured by the long-term loan outweigh or at least equal to the negative effect\nto the future economy from the long-term debt incurred by the loan. Finally, I\nfound that non-normally distributed volatility models generally perform better\nthan normally distributed ones. More specifically, TARCH-GED performs the best\nin the group of non-normally distributed, while GARCH-M does the best in the\ngroup of normally distributed.\n","Comment: 82 Pages with Gretl codes included"]}]

We begin by obtaining the handoff rate for a mobile user in an\nirregular cellular network with the access point locations modeled as a\nhomogeneous Poisson point process. The received signal-to-interference-ratio\n(SIR) distribution along with a chosen SIR threshold is then used to obtain the\nprobability of coverage. To capture potential connection failures due to\nmobility, we assume that a fraction of handoffs result in such failures.\nConsidering a multi-tier network with orthogonal spectrum allocation among\ntiers and the maximum biased average received power as the tier association\nmetric, we derive the probability of coverage for two cases: 1) the user is\nstationary (i.e., handoffs do not occur, or the system is not sensitive to\nhandoffs); 2) the user is mobile, and the system is sensitive to handoffs. We\nderive the optimal bias factors to maximize the coverage. We show that when the\nuser is mobile, and the network is sensitive to handoffs, both the optimum tier\nassociation and the probability of coverage depend on the user's speed; a\nspeed-dependent bias factor can then adjust the tier association to effectively\nimprove the coverage, and hence system performance, in a fully-loaded network.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Wireless\n  Communications"]}]

A routing algorithm on G has a competitive ratio of c if the\nlength of the path produced by the algorithm from any vertex s to any vertex t\nis at most c times the length of the shortest path from s to t in G. If the\nlength of the path is at most c times the Euclidean distance from s to t, we\nsay that the routing algorithm on G has a routing ratio of c.We present an\nonline routing algorithm on the Delaunay triangulation with competitive and\nrouting ratios of 5.90.

The algorithm is a generalization of the\ndeterministic 1-local routing algorithm by Chew on the L1-Delaunay\ntriangulation.

In systems with strong structural and electronic anisotropies, the\ninterlayer separation, s, plays a significant role. In cuprates, the pseudogap\n(PG) correlation induces a downturn in the temperature dependent resistivity.\nAs Tc is approached from above, this downturn in the resistivity is supposed to\neither i) add to or ii) join smoothly to that due to paraconductivity caused by\nshort-lived Cooper pairs. It is important to differentiate between these two\npossibilities since they are closely linked to the origin of the PG.

We find that, for the sphere sizes considered in this\ncontribution, the radiative decay rate is barely affected by the presence of\nthe nanosphere, whereas the non-radiative decay rate is greatly enhanced due to\nenergy transfer from the quantum system to the nanosphere, leading to a strong\nquenching of the emission of the quantum system. The emission wavelength of the\nquantum emitter and its intrinsic quantum yield play an important role and the\nimpact of both has to be considered together when investigating their effect on\nthe non-radiative decay rate. The energy transfer process from the emitter to\nthe nanosphere has a complicated distance dependence, with a 1/r^6 regime,\ncharacteristic of the F\\\"orster energy transfer mechanism, but also exhibiting\nother distance dependence regimes. In the case of a donor-acceptor pair in the\npresence of a Au nanosphere, the donor couples strongly to the nanosphere,\nacting as an enhanced dipole; the donor-acceptor energy transfer rate then\nfollows a F\\\"orster trend, with an increased F\\\"orster radius.

Considering a negative flow of the\ndiscrete Chen-Lee-Liu hierarchy, we obtain a proper discretization of the\nmassive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates. Multicomponent\ngeneralizations of the obtained discrete equations are straightforward because\nthe performed computations are valid for the general case where the dependent\nvariables are vector- or matrix-valued.\n","Comment: 22 pages"]}]
