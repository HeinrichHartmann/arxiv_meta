For a certain non-selfadjoint linear operator, which defines a\nlinear part of the Kuramoto model, the spectral theory on a space of\ngeneralized functions is developed with the aid of a rigged Hilbert space to\navoid a continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. Although the linear operator\nhas an unbounded continuous spectrum on a Hilbert space, it is shown that it\nadmits a spectral decomposition consisting of a countable number of\neigenfunctions on a space of generalized functions. The semigroup generated by\nthe linear operator is calculated by using the spectral decomposition to prove\nthe linear stability of a steady state of the system.

We propose new simple, computationally\ninexpensive bispectrum statistics that are near optimal for the specific\napplications like bias determination.

Thus the linear bias\n$b_1$ is best determined by the shift cross-spectrum, while the squared density\nand tidal cross-spectra mostly tighten constraints on $b_2$ and $b_{s^2}$ once\n$b_1$ is known.

In particular, after\nperforming a large number of numerical-relativity simulations of binaries with\nnuclear equations of state, we have found that the post-merger emission is\ncharacterized by two distinct and robust spectral features. While the\nhigh-frequency peak was already shown to be associated with the oscillations of\nthe hypermassive neutron star produced by the merger and to depend on the\nequation of state, we have highlighted that the low-frequency peak is related\nto the merger process and to the total compactness of the stars in the binary.\nThis relation is essentially universal and provides a powerful tool to set\ntight constraints on the equation of state. We here provide additional\ninformation on the extensive analysis performed, illustrating the methods used,\nthe tests considered, as well as the robustness of the results. We also discuss\nadditional relations that can be deduced when exploring the data and how these\ncorrelate with various properties of the binary.

The idea is that segments of the Fermi\ncontours are connected by q_cdw, resulting in the effective screening of\nphonons inducing Kohn Anomalies in their dispersion at q_cdw, driving a lattice\nrestructuring at low temperatures.

The corresponding estimation problem\nis highly nonlinear and, in general, requires an estimation of the number of\nmultipath components. In the IARD approach individual multipath components are\nprocessed sequentially, which permits a tractable convergence analysis of the\ncorresponding inference expressions. This leads to a simple condition, termed\nhere a pruning condition, that determines if a multipath component is\n\"sparsified\" or retained in the model, thus permitting a fast and adaptive\nrealization of the estimation algorithm. Yet previous experiments demonstrated\nthat IARD fails to select the correct number of components when the parameters\nentering nonlinearly the multipath model are also estimated. To understand this\neffect, an analysis of the statistical structure of the pruning condition is\nproposed. It is shown that the corresponding test statistic in the pruning\ncondition follows an extreme value distribution. As a result, the standard IARD\nalgorithm implements a statistical test with a very high probability of false\nalarm. This leads to insertion of estimation artifacts and underestimation of\nsignal sparsity. Moreover, the probability of false alarm worsens as the number\nof measured signal samples grows. Based on the developed statistical\ninterpretation of the IARD, an optimal adjustment of the pruning condition is\nproposed.

In practice, due to the pile-up effect of the detector, it's\ndifficult to directly measure the spectrum of a CT scanner using an energy\nresolved detector. An alternative solution is to estimate the spectrum using\ntransmission measurements with a step phantom or other CT phantom. In this\nwork, we present a new spectrum estimation method based on indirect\ntransmission measurement and model spectra mixture approach. The estimated\nx-ray spectrum was expressed as weighted summation of a set of model spectra,\nwhich can significantly reduce the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the spectrum\nestimation problem. Next, an estimated projection can be calculated with the\nassumed spectrum. By iteratively updating the unknown weights, we minimized the\ndifference between the estimated projection data and the raw projection data.\nThe final spectrum was calculated with these calibrated weights and the model\nspectra. Both simulation and experimental data were used to evaluate the\nproposed method. In the simulation study, the estimated spectra were compared\nto the raw spectra which were used to generate the raw projection data. For the\nexperimental study, the ground truth measurement of the raw x-ray spectrum was\nnot available. Therefore, the estimated spectrum was compared against spectra\ngenerated using the SpekCalc software with tube configurations provided by the\nscanner manufacturer. The results show the proposed method has potential to\naccurately estimate x-ray spectra using the raw projection data. The difference\nbetween the mean energy of the raw spectra and the mean energy of the estimated\nspectra were smaller than 0.5 keV for both simulation and experimental data.\nFurther tests show the method was robust with respect to the model spectra\ngenerator.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures"]}]
