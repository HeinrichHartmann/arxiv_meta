In this work, we first perform a theoretical\nanalysis of the two schemes in the finite volume framework by comparing their\nnumerical flux evaluations. It is found that the effects of collision term are\nconsidered in the reconstructions of the cell-interface distribution function\nin both schemes, which explains why they can overcome the time step restriction\nand can give accurate results even as the time step is much larger than the\ncollision time. The difference between the two schemes lies in the treatment of\nthe integral of the collision term, in which the Bardow's scheme uses the\nrectangular rule while the DUGKS uses the trapezoidal rule. The performance of\nthe two schemes, i.e., accuracy, stability, and efficiency are then compared by\nsimulating several two dimensional flows, including the unsteady Taylor-Green\nvortex flow, the steady lid-driven cavity flow, and the laminar boundary layer\nproblem.

As a special case of the main theorem, we generalize a\ndescription of the center of graded fusion category due to Turaev and\nVirelizier to tensor categories: if $C$ is a $G$-graded (locally bounded)\ntensor category, then $G$ acts on the relative center of $C$ with respect to\nthe degree one part $C_1$, and the equivariantization of this action is the\ncenter of $C$.\n","Comment: 32 pages"]}]

In this paper we propose an incremental approach to\nsolving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear Horn clause solver. We\nachieve this by interleaving a program transformation and a linear solver. The\nprogram transformation is based on the notion of tree dimension, which we apply\nto trees corresponding to Horn clause derivations. The dimension of a tree is a\nmeasure of its non-linearity -- for example a linear tree (whose nodes have at\nmost one child) has dimension zero while a complete binary tree has dimension\nequal to its height.\n  A given set of Horn clauses $P$ can be transformed into a new set of clauses\n$P^k$ (whose derivation trees are the subset of $P$'s derivation trees with\ndimension at most $k$). We start by generating $P^k$ with $k=0$, which is\nlinear by definition, then pass it to a linear solver. If $P^k$ has a solution\n$M$, and is a solution to $P$ then $P$ has a solution $M$. If $M$ is not a\nsolution of $P$, we plugged $M$ to $P^{(k+1)}$ which again becomes linear and\npass it to the solver and continue successively for increasing value of $k$\nuntil we find a solution to $P$ or resources are exhausted. Experiment on some\nHorn clause verification benchmarks indicates that this is a promising approach\nfor solving a set of non-linear Horn clauses using a linear solver.

We have also studied the parameters\naffecting this probability. We have discussed the special case of two-neutrino\noscillations. Lastly, we have discussed some basic properties of neutrinos that\nare reflected in the previous derivations and highlighted a few relevant open\nproblems.\n  To begin with, we have also studied the relevant topics in introductory High\nEnergy Physics and Quantum Mechanics to familiarize with the notations, units\nand methodologies that would be required for the subsequent topics.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]

Our program, Hot RAD, presents a\nstraightforward and easy-to-use method to take raw Illumina data that has been\nRAD tagged and produce consensus contigs or sequence stacks using a distributed\nframework, creating a basis on which to begin analyzing an organism's DNA.
