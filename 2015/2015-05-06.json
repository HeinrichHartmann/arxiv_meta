The presence of a duplicate removes the constraint of natural\nselection upon the gene, leading to its likely loss of function or,\noccasionally, the gain of a novel one. Alternately, a pleiotropic gene might\npartition its functions among its duplicates, thus preserving both copies.\nDuplicate genes is not a novelty for diploid genotypes, but only for\nhaplotypes. In this paper, we study the consequences of regulatory interactions\nin diploid genotypes and explore how the context of allelic interactions gives\nrise to dynamical phenotypes that enable duplicate genes to spread in a\npopulation. The regulatory network we study is that of a single autoregulatory\nactivator gene, and the two copies of the gene diverge either as alleles in a\ndiploid species or as duplicates in haploids. These differences are in their\ntranscriptional ability -- either via alterations to its activating domain, or\nto its cis-regulatory binding repertoire. When cis-regulatory changes are\nintroduced that partition multiple regulatory triggers among the duplicates, it\nis shown that mutually exclusive expression states of the duplicates that\nemerge are accompanied by a back-up facility: when a highly expressed gene is\ndeleted, the previously unexpressed duplicate copy compensates for it. The\ndiploid version of the regulatory network model can account for allele-specific\nexpression variants, and a model of inheritance of the haplotype network\nenables us to trace the evolutionary consequence of heterozygous phenotypes.\nThis is modelled for the variations in the activating domain of one copy,\nwhereby stable as well as transiently bursting oscillations ensue in single\ncells.

The\nother two relate to a closer examination of the issue of the representability\nof real functions by their Fourier coefficients. As was shown in the previous\npaper, in many cases one can recover the real function from its Fourier\ncoefficients even if the corresponding Fourier series diverges almost\neverywhere. In such cases we say that the real function is still representable\nby its Fourier coefficients. Here we establish a very weak condition on the\nFourier coefficients that ensures the representability of the function by those\ncoefficients. In addition to this, we show that any real function that is\nabsolutely integrable can be recovered almost everywhere from, and hence is\nrepresentable by, its Fourier coefficients, regardless of whether or not its\nFourier series converges.

In this simulation, we have shown how, in the\npresence of MHD turbulence, a time-steady transition can be achieved between an\ninner disk region aligned with the equatorial plane of the central mass's spin\nand an outer region orbiting in a different plane. The position of the\nequilibrium orientation transition is determined by a balance between\ngravitomagnetic torque and warp-induced inward mixing of misaligned angular\nmomentum from the outer disk. If the mixing is interpreted in terms of\ndiffusive transport, the implied diffusion coefficient is\n~(0.6--0.8)c_s^2/Omega for sound speed c_s and orbital frequency Omega. This\ncalibration permits estimation of the orientation transition's equilibrium\nlocation given the central mass, its spin parameter, and the disk's surface\ndensity and scaleheight profiles. However, the alignment front overshoots\nbefore settling into an equilibrium, signaling that a diffusive model does not\nfully represent the time-dependent properties of alignment fronts under these\nconditions. Because the precessional torque on the disk at the alignment front\nis always comparable to the rate at which misaligned angular momentum is\nbrought inward to the front by warp-driven radial motions, no break forms\nbetween the inner and outer portions of the disk in our simulation.

The\n\"anterior side\" of the CP is the side not containing the GC (which the\n\"posterior\" side does). The TS is defined as the sphere with center at GC and\ntangent to the CP at LC. The percentage of protein atoms (a.) inside the TS,\nand (b.) on the anterior side of the CP, are two complementary measures of\nligand or LBS burial depth since the latter is directly proportional to (b.)\nand inversely proportional to (a.). We tested the CP and TS methods using a\ntest set of 67 well characterized protein-ligand structures (Laskowski et al.,\n1996), as well as the theoretical case of an artificial protein in the form of\na cubic lattice grid of points in the overall shape of a sphere and in which\nLBS of any depth can be specified. Results from both the CP and TS methods\nagree very well with data reported by Laskowski et al., and results from the\ntheoretical case further confirm that that both methods are suitable measures\nof ligand or LBS burial. Prior to this study, there were no such numerical\nmeasures of LBS burial available, and hence no way to directly and objectively\ncompare LBS depths in different proteins. LBS burial depth is an important\nparameter as it is usually directly related to the amount of conformational\nchange a protein undergoes upon ligand binding, and ability to quantify it\ncould allow meaningful comparison of protein dynamics and flexibility.\n","Comment: 11 pages text; 7 figures (all multi-panel); 3 tables; 34 total pages\n  (incl. figures & tables)"]}]

Computational prediction\nof ligand binding sites (LBS) is a well-established protein function assignment\nmethod. Here we apply the specific LBS detection algorithm we recently\ndescribed (Reyes, V.M. & Sheth, V.N., 2011; Reyes, V.M., 2015a) to some 801\nfunctionally unannotated experimental structures in the Protein Data Bank by\nscreening for the binding sites (BS) of 6 biologically important ligands: GTP\nin small Ras-type G-proteins, ATP in ser/thr protein kinases, sialic acid\n(SIA), retinoic acid (REA), and heme-bound and unbound (free) nitric oxide\n(hNO, fNO). Validation of the algorithm for the GTP- and ATP-binding sites has\nbeen previously described in detail (ibid.); here, validation for the BSs of\nthe 4 other ligands shows both good specificity and sensitivity. Of the 801\nstructures screened, 8 tested positive for GTP binding, 61 for ATP binding, 35\nfor SIA binding, 132 for REA binding, 33 for hNO binding, and 10 for fNO\nbinding. Using the cutting plane and tangent sphere methods we described\npreviously, (Reyes, V.M., 2015b), we also determined the depth of burial of the\nLBSs detected above and compared the values with those from the respective\ntraining structures, and the degree of similarity between the two values taken\nas a further validation of the predicted LBSs. Applying this criterion, we were\nable to narrow down the predicted GTP-binding proteins to 2, the ATP-binding\nproteins to 13, the SIA-binding proteins to 2, the REA-binding proteins to 14,\nthe hNO-binding proteins to 4, and the fNO-binding proteins to 1. We believe\nthis further criterion increases the confidence level of our LBS predictions.\n","Comment: 33 pages total (12 pages text; 21 pages figures and tables); 2\n  figures; 6 tables (all multi-panel); 7200 words in text; 7274 words incl. in\n  figures and tables"]}]

It involves screening for pairs of tetrahedra\nrepresenting interacting amino acids at the interface of the protein-protein\ncomplex, with one tetrahedron on each protomer. H-bonds and VDW interactions at\ntheir interface are first determined and then interacting tetrahedral motifs\n(one from each protomer) representing backbone or side chain centroids of the\ninteracting amino acids, are then built. The method requires that the protein\nprotomers be transformed first into double-centroid reduced representation\n(Reyes, V.M. & Sheth, V.N., 2011; Reyes, V.M., 2015a). The method is applied to\na set of 801 protein structures in the PDB with unknown functions, which were\nscreened for pairs of tetrahedral motifs characteristic of nine binary\ncomplexes, namely: (1.) RAP-Gmppnp-cRAF1 Ras-binding domain; (2.) RHOA-protein\nkinase PKN/PRK1 effector domain; (3.) RAC-HOGD1; (4.) RAC-P67PHOX; (5.)\nkinase-associated phosphatase (KAP)-phosphoCDK2; (6.)

The results were further validated by applying the CP and TS\nmethods (Reyes, V.M., 2015b) for the quantitative determination of interface\nburial and inter-protomer overlap in the complex.
