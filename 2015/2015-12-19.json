In contrast, a dominant line\nof work in the theory of voting over the past 15 years has considered a\ndifferent kind of scenario, also fundamental to voting, in which there is a\ngenuinely \"best\" outcome that voters would agree on if they only had enough\ninformation. This type of scenario has its roots in the classical Condorcet\nJury Theorem; it includes cases such as jurors in a criminal trial who all want\nto reach the correct verdict but disagree in their inferences from the\navailable evidence, or a corporate board of directors who all want to improve\nthe company's revenue, but who have different information that favors different\noptions.\n  This style of voting leads to a natural set of questions: each voter has a\n{\\em private signal} that provides probabilistic information about which option\nis best, and a central question is whether a simple plurality voting system,\nwhich tabulates votes for different options, can cause the group decision to\narrive at the correct option. We show that plurality voting is powerful enough\nto achieve this: there is a way for voters to map their signals into votes for\noptions in such a way that --- with sufficiently many voters --- the correct\noption receives the greatest number of votes with high probability. We show\nfurther, however, that any process for achieving this is inherently expensive\nin the number of voters it requires: succeeding in identifying the correct\noption with probability at least $1 - \\eta$ requires $\\Omega(n^3 \\epsilon^{-2}\n\\log \\eta^{-1})$ voters, where $n$ is the number of options and $\\epsilon$ is a\ndistributional measure of the minimum difference between the options.\n"]}]

In this paper, we\npresent the achievable rate regions for a cloud radio network using a\nsub-optimal zero forcing equalizer with dirty paper precoding. We show that\nwhen complete channel state information is available at the cloud, rates close\nto those achievable with total interference cancellation can be achieved. With\nmean capacity gains, of up to 2 fold over the conventional cellular network in\nboth uplink and downlink, this precoding scheme shows great promise for\nimplementation in a cloud radio network. To simplify the analysis, we use a\nstochastic geometric framework based of Poisson point processes instead of the\ntraditional grid based cellular network model.\n  We also study the impact of limiting the channel state information and\ngeographical clustering to limit the cloud size on the achievable rate. We have\nobserved that using this zero forcing-dirty paper coding technique, the adverse\neffect of inter-cluster interference can be minimized thereby transforming an\ninterference limited network into a noise limited network as experienced by an\naverage user in the network for low operating signal-to-noise-ratios. However,\nfor higher signal-to-noise-ratios, both the average achievable rate and\ncell-edge achievable rate saturate as observed in literature. As the\nimplementation of dirty paper coding is practically not feasible, we present a\npractical design of a cloud radio network using cloud a minimum mean square\nequalizer for processing the uplink streams and use Tomlinson-Harashima\nprecoder as a sub-optimal substitute for a dirty paper precoder in downlink.\n"]}]
