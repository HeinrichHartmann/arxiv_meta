The presence of function\nsymbols in the program may render the ground instantiation infinite, and\nfiniteness of models and termination of the evaluation procedure, in the\ngeneral case, are not guaranteed anymore. Since the program termination problem\nis undecidable in the general case, several decidable criteria (called program\ntermination criteria) have been recently proposed. However, current conditions\nare not able to identify even simple programs, whose bottom-up execution always\nterminates. The paper introduces new decidable criteria for checking\ntermination of logic programs with function symbols under bottom-up evaluation,\nby deeply analyzing the program structure. First, we analyze the propagation of\ncomplex terms among arguments by means of the extended version of the argument\ngraph called propagation graph. The resulting criterion, called\nGamma-acyclicity, generalizes most of the decidable criteria proposed so far.\nNext, we study how rules may activate each other and define a more powerful\ncriterion, called safety. This criterion uses the so-called safety function\nable to analyze how rules may activate each other and how the presence of some\narguments in a rule limits its activation. We also study the application of the\nproposed criteria to bound queries and show that the safety criterion is\nwell-suited to identify relevant classes of programs and bound queries.\nFinally, we propose a hierarchy of classes of terminating programs, called\nk-safety, where the k-safe class strictly includes the (k-1)-safe class.

In the $e^+e^-$ beam mode, we consider various production and decay\nmodes of the heavy neutrino ($N$), and find that the final state with\n$e+2j+{E\\!\\!\\!/}_T$, arising from the $e^+e^-\\to N\\nu$ production mode, is the\nmost promising channel.

In pursuit of model-independent constraints\non the properties of the ionising sources, we determine the empirical evolution\nof the cosmic ionizing emissivity. We use a simple two-parameter model to map\nout the evolution in the emissivity at z>~6 from the new Planck optical depth\ntau measurements, from the constraints provided by quasar absorption spectra\nand from the prevalence of Ly-alpha emission in z~7-8 galaxies. We find the\nredshift evolution in the emissivity dot{N}_{ion}(z) required by the\nobservations to be d(log Nion)/dz=-0.15(-0.11)(+0.08), largely independent of\nthe assumed clumping factor C_{HII} and entirely independent of the nature of\nthe ionising sources. The trend in dot{N}_{ion}(z) is well-matched by the\nevolution of the galaxy UV-luminosity density (dlog_{10}\nrho_UV/dz=-0.11+/-0.04) to a magnitude limit >~-13 mag, suggesting that\ngalaxies are the sources that drive the reionization of the universe. The role\nof galaxies is further strengthened by the conversion from the UV luminosity\ndensity rho_UV to dot(N)_{ion}(z) being possible for physically-plausible\nvalues of the escape fraction f_{esc}, the Lyman-continuum photon production\nefficiency xi_{ion}, and faint-end cut-off $M_{lim}$ to the luminosity\nfunction. Quasars/AGN appear to match neither the redshift evolution nor\nnormalization of the ionizing emissivity. Based on the inferred evolution in\nthe ionizing emissivity, we estimate that the z~10 UV-luminosity density is\n8(-4)(+15)x lower than at $z~6, consistent with the observations. The present\napproach of contrasting the inferred evolution of the ionizing emissivity with\nthat of the galaxy UV luminosity density adds to the growing observational\nevidence that faint, star-forming galaxies drive the reionization of the\nuniverse.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables, Astrophysical Journal, updated to\n  match version in press, Figure 6 shows the main result of the paper"]}]

High-redshift infrared galaxy\n  overdensity candidates and lensed sources discovered by Planck and confirmed\n  by Herschel-SPIRE"],"description":["  [Abridged] We use the Planck all-sky submm and mm maps to search for rare\nsources distinguished by extreme brightness, a few hundreds of mJy, and their\npotential for being situated at high redshift. These \"cold\" Planck sources,\nselected using the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) directly from the maps and\nfrom the Planck Catalogue of Compact Sources (PCCS), all satisfy the criterion\nof having their rest-frame far-infrared peak redshifted to the frequency range\n353 and 857 GHz. This colour-selection favours galaxies in the redshift range\nz=2-4, which we consider as cold peaks in the cosmic infrared background (CIB).\nWe perform a dedicated Herschel-SPIRE follow-up of 234 such Planck targets,\nfinding a significant excess of red 350 and 500um sources, in comparison to\nreference SPIRE fields. About 94% of the SPIRE sources in the Planck fields are\nconsistent with being overdensities of galaxies peaking at 350um. About 3% are\ncandidate lensed systems, all 12 of which have secure spectroscopic\nconfirmations, placing them at redshifts z>2.2. The galaxy overdensities are\ndetected with high significance, half of the sample showing statistical\nsignificance above 10sigma. The SPIRE photometric redshifts of galaxies in\noverdensities suggest a peak at z~2. Under the Td=35K assumption, we derive an\ninfrared (IR) luminosity for each SPIRE source of about 4x10^12 Lsun, yielding\nstar formation rates of typically 700 Msun.yr^-1. If the observed overdensities\nare actual gravitationally-bound structures, the total total star formation\nrates reaches 7x10^3 Msun.yr^-1.

Tracing underdensities with biased galaxies"],"description":["  We study how the properties of cosmic voids depend on those of the tracer\ngalaxy populations in which they are identified. We use a suite of halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) mocks in a simulation, identify voids in these\npopulations using the ZOBOV void finder and measure their abundances, sizes,\ntracer densities, and dark matter content. To separate the effects of bias from\nthose of sampling density, we do the same for voids traced by randomly\ndown-sampled subsets of the simulation dark matter particles. At the same\nsampling density, galaxy bias reduces the total number of voids by ~50% and can\ndramatically change their size distribution. The matter content of voids in\nbiased and unbiased tracers also differs. Deducing void properties from\nsimulation therefore requires the use of realistic galaxy mocks. We discuss how\nthe void observables can be related to their matter content. In particular we\nconsider the compensation of the total mass deficit in voids and find that the\ndistinction between over- and under-compensated voids is not a function of void\nsize alone, as has previously been suggested. However, we find a simple linear\nrelationship between the average density of tracers in the void and the total\nmass compensation on much larger scales. The existence of this linear\nrelationship holds independent of the bias and sampling density of the tracers.\nThis provides a universal tool to classify void environments and will be\nimportant for the use of voids in observational cosmology.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures.

We revisit the question of IR excesses around RGs using higher\nspatial resolution IR data, primarily from WISE. Our goal was to elucidate the\nlink between three unusual RG properties: fast rotation, enriched Li, and IR\nexcess. We have 316 targets thought to be K giants, about 40% of which we take\nto be Li-rich. In 24 cases with previous detections of IR excess at low spatial\nresolution, we believe that source confusion is playing a role, in that either\n(a) the source that is bright in the optical is not responsible for the IR\nflux, or (b) there is more than one source responsible for the IR flux as\nmeasured in IRAS. We looked for IR excesses in the remaining sources,\nidentifying 28 that have significant IR excesses by ~20 um (with possible\nexcesses for 2 additional sources). There appears to be an intriguing\ncorrelation in that the largest IR excesses are all in Li-rich K giants, though\nvery few Li-rich K giants have IR excesses (large or small). These largest IR\nexcesses also tend to be found in the fastest rotators. There is no correlation\nof IR excess with the carbon isotopic ratio, 12C/13C. IR excesses by 20 um,\nthough relatively rare, are at least twice as common among our sample of\nLi-rich K giants.

In the process, the\nsystem becomes an (ultra) luminous infrared galaxy, or (U)LIRG, that morphs to\na quasar, to a K+A galaxy, and finally to an early-type galaxy. The time scales\nfor this metamorphosis are only loosely constrained by observations. In\nparticular, the K+A phase should follow immediately after the QSO phase during\nwhich the dust and gas remaining from the (U)LIRG phase are expelled by the\nAGN. An intermediate class of QSOs with K+A spectral signatures, the\npost-starburst QSOs or PSQ, may represent the transitional phase between QSOs\nand K+As. We have compiled a sample of 72 {bona fide} $z<0.5$ PSQ from the SDSS\nDR7 QSO catalogue. We find the intermediate age populations in this sample to\nbe on average significantly weaker and metal poorer than their putative\ndescendants, the K+A galaxies. The typical spectral energy distribution of PSQ\nis well fitted by three components: starlight; an obscured power-law; and a hot\ndust component required to reproduce the mid-IR fluxes. From the slope and\nbolometric luminosity of the power-law component we estimate typical masses and\naccretion rates of the AGN, but we find little evidence of powerful radio-loud\nor strong X-ray emitters in our sample. This may indicate that the power-law\ncomponent originates in a nuclear starburst rather than in an AGN, as expected\nif the bulk of their young stars are still being formed, or that the AGN is\nstill heavily enshrouded in dust and gas. We find that both alternatives are\nproblematic and that more and better optical, X-ray, and mm-wave observations\nare needed to elucidate the evolutionary history of PSQ.\n","Comment: A&A accepted"]}]

We\npresent a number of hydrodynamical simulations that explore the response of gas\ndisks around two observed binary systems: Kepler-16 and Kepler-34. We probe the\nimportance of disk viscosity, aspect-ratio, inner boundary condition, initial\nsurface density gradient, and self-gravity on the dynamical evolution of the\ndisk, as well as its quasi steady-state profile. We find there is a strong\ninfluence of binary type on the mean disk eccentricity, e_d, leading to e_d =\n0.02 - 0.08 for Kepler-16 and e_d = 0.10 - 0.15 in Kepler-34. The value of\nalpha-viscosity has little influence on the disk, but we find a strong increase\nin mean disk eccentricity with increasing aspect-ratio due to wave propagation\neffects. The choice of inner boundary condition only has a small effect on the\nsurface density and eccentricity of the disk.

The\nstriking correspondence between the observational results of Paper I and the\nnumerical results of this paper provides a consistent physical picture of light\nbridges. The dynamic activity phenomena occur as a natural result of the bridge\nformation and its convective nature, which has much in common with those of\numbral dots and penumbral filaments.\n","Comment: 39 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ"]}]

By\ndefinition such a goal function, if universal, cannot be cast in\nprocessing-domain specific language (e.g. 'edge filtering', 'working memory').\nThus, to formulate such a principle, we have to use a domain-independent\nframework. Information theory offers such a framework. However, while the\nclassical framework of information theory focuses on the relation between one\ninput and one output (Shannon's mutual information), we argue that neural\ninformation processing crucially depends on the combination of\n\\textit{multiple} inputs to create the output of a processor. To account for\nthis, we use a very recent extension of Shannon Information theory, called\npartial information decomposition (PID). PID allows to quantify the information\nthat several inputs provide individually (unique information), redundantly\n(shared information) or only jointly (synergistic information) about the\noutput. First, we review the framework of PID. Then we apply it to reevaluate\nand analyze several earlier proposals of information theoretic neural goal\nfunctions (predictive coding, infomax, coherent infomax, efficient coding). We\nfind that PID allows to compare these goal functions in a common framework, and\nalso provides a versatile approach to design new goal functions from first\nprinciples. Building on this, we design and analyze a novel goal function,\ncalled 'coding with synergy'. [...]\n","Comment: 21 pages, 4 figures, appendix"]}]

When backhaul\ncooperation is available, we develop a new idea that we call cooperation\nalignment, which guarantees that the average (per user) backhaul load remains\nthe same as we increase the number of users. In the case of transmitter\ncooperation, the transmitters can form their jointly precoded signals through\nan interactive protocol over the backhaul.

Sparsity prior has been\nfound to be an efficient strategy in CT reconstruction where significantly\nfewer attenuation measurements are available. Sparsity prior CT reconstruction\nrelies on iterative algorithms such as the algebraic reconstruction technique\n(ART) to produce a crude reconstruction based on which a sparse approximation\nis performed. Data driven adjustment of relaxation has been found to ensure\nbetter convergence than traditional relaxation for ART.

How fast does this amount of entropy grow as the level\nof resolution becomes finer and finer?\n  (3) When can we embed $X$ into the $\\mathbb{Z}^k$-shift on the infinite\ndimensional cube $([0,1]^D)^{\\mathbb{Z}^k}$?\n  These were investigated for $\\mathbb{Z}$-actions in [Lindenstrauss, Mean\ndimension, small entropy factors and an embedding theorem, Inst. Hautes\n\\'Etudes Sci. Publ. Math. \\textbf{89} (1999) 227-262], but the generalization\nto $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ remained an open problem. When $X$ has the marker property,\nin particular when $X$ has a completely aperiodic minimal factor, we completely\nsolve (1) and a natural interpretation of (2), and give a reasonably\nsatisfactory answer to (3).\n  A key ingredient is a new method to continuously partition every orbit into\ngood pieces.\n","Comment: 44 pages"]}]

We provide published spectral types\nand simple labels on stellar type for quick assessment of design reference\nmission-selected targets lists. The number of known exoplanet companions is\nindicated for each star, and for bright stars (V<7) we provide separations and\ndelta-magnitudes for the brightest stellar companion within 10 arcseconds.\nOther important stellar data such as log(g), chromospheric activity level, and\nage estimates are provided where readily available.

Following Korotkin we solve the\nRiemann-Hilbert problem in terms of the Szego kernel of certain Riemann\nsurfaces branched over the given 2m+2 points. These Riemann surfaces are\nconstructed from a permutation representation of the symmetric group S_N to\nwhich the quasi-permutation monodromy representation has been reduced. The\npermutation representation of our problem generates the cyclic subgroup Z_N.\nFor this reason the corresponding Riemann surfaces of genus N(m-1) have Z_N\nsymmetry. This fact enables us to write the matrix entries of the solution of\nthe NxN Riemann-Hilbert problem as a product of an algebraic function and\ntheta-function quotients. The algebraic function turns out to be related to the\nSzego kernel with zero characteristics. From the solution of the Riemann-\nHilbert problem we automatically obtain a particular solution of the\nSchlesinger system. The tau-function of the Schlesinger system is computed\nexplicitly. The rank 3 problem with four singular points (0,t,1,\\infty) is\nstudied in detail. The corresponding solution of the Riemann-Hilbert problem\nand the Schlesinger system is given in terms of Jacobi's theta-function with\nmodulus T=T(t), Im(T)>0.
