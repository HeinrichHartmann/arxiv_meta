The rapidly increasing\nnumber of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators.\nOptical microresonator based comb generators bear promise in this regard.\nCritical to their future use as 'frequency markers', is however the absolute\nfrequency stabilization of the optical comb spectrum. A powerful technique for\nthis stabilization is self-referencing, which requires a spectrum that spans a\nfull octave, i.e. a factor of two in frequency. In the case of mode locked\nlasers, overcoming the limited bandwidth has become possible only with the\nadvent of photonic crystal fibres for supercontinuum generation. Here, we\nreport for the first time the generation of an octave-spanning frequency comb\ndirectly from a toroidal microresonator on a silicon chip. The comb spectrum\ncovers the wavelength range from 990 nm to 2170 nm and is retrieved from a\ncontinuous wave laser interacting with the modes of an ultra high Q\nmicroresonator, without relying on external broadening. Full tunability of the\ngenerated frequency comb over a bandwidth exceeding an entire free spectral\nrange is demonstrated. This allows positioning of a frequency comb mode to any\ndesired frequency within the comb bandwidth. The ability to derive octave\nspanning spectra from microresonator comb generators represents a key step\ntowards achieving a radio-frequency to optical link on a chip, which could\nunify the fields of metrology with micro- and nano-photonics and enable\nentirely new devices that bring frequency metrology into a chip scale setting\nfor compact applications such as space based optical clocks.\n"]}]

The most obvious source for such a distribution is past data. The goal\nis to understand how much data is necessary and sufficient to guarantee\nnear-optimal expected revenue.\n  Our basic model is a single-item auction in which bidders' valuations are\ndrawn independently from unknown and non-identical distributions. The seller is\ngiven $m$ samples from each of these distributions \"for free\" and chooses an\nauction to run on a fresh sample. How large does m need to be, as a function of\nthe number k of bidders and eps > 0, so that a (1 - eps)-approximation of the\noptimal revenue is achievable?\n  We prove that, under standard tail conditions on the underlying\ndistributions, m = poly(k, 1/eps) samples are necessary and sufficient. Our\nlower bound stands in contrast to many recent results on simple and\nprior-independent auctions and fundamentally involves the interplay between\nbidder competition, non-identical distributions, and a very close (but still\nconstant) approximation of the optimal revenue. It effectively shows that the\nonly way to achieve a sufficiently good constant approximation of the optimal\nrevenue is through a detailed understanding of bidders' valuation\ndistributions. Our upper bound is constructive and applies in particular to a\nvariant of the empirical Myerson auction, the natural auction that runs the\nrevenue-maximizing auction with respect to the empirical distributions of the\nsamples.\n  Our sample complexity lower bound depends on the set of allowable\ndistributions, and to capture this we introduce alpha-strongly regular\ndistributions, which interpolate between the well-studied classes of regular\n(alpha = 0) and MHR (alpha = 1) distributions.

This work aims to validate the nuclear models employed by the\nGeant4 MC code, by comparing the simulated absolute dose distribution to a\nrecent experiment of a 177 MeV proton pencil beam stopping in water.\n  Striking agreement is observed over five orders of magnitude, with both the\nshape and normalisation well modelled. The normalisations of two depth dose\ncurves are lower than experiment, though this could be explained by an\nexperimental positioning error. The Geant4 neutron production model is also\nverified in the distal region. The entrance dose is poorly modelled, suggesting\nan unaccounted upstream source of low-energy protons. Recommendations are given\nfor a follow-up experiment which could resolve these issues.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 4 figures; minor textual revisions"]}]

We utilize two types of\nsocial labels in tweets, i.e., hashtags and hyper-links. Hashtags are used to\ncluster documents into different topic sets. Also, a tweet with a hyper-link\noften highlights certain key points of the corresponding document. We\nsynthesize a linked document cluster to form a reference summary which can\ncover most key points. To this aim, we adopt the ROUGE metrics to measure the\ncoverage ratio, and develop an Integer Linear Programming solution to discover\nthe sentence set reaching the upper bound of ROUGE. Since we allow summary\nsentences to be selected from both documents and high-quality tweets, the\ngenerated reference summaries could be abstractive. Both informativeness and\nreadability of the collected summaries are verified by manual judgment. In\naddition, we train a Support Vector Regression summarizer on DUC generic\nmulti-document summarization benchmarks. With the collected data as extra\ntraining resource, the performance of the summarizer improves a lot on all the\ntest sets. We release this dataset for further research.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure in AAAI 2016"]}]

In symbolic model checking event\nlocality plays a major role in time and memory usage. For example, in Petri\nnets event locality can be captured by dependency matrices, where nonzero\nentries indicate whether a transition modifies a place. The quality of event\nlocality has been expressed as a metric called (weighted) event span. The\nbandwidth of a matrix is a metric indicating the distance of nonzero elements\nto the diagonal. Wavefront is a metric indicating the degree of nonzeros on one\nend of the diagonal of the matrix.

Since a few\nspecific cases have only been treated theoretically in the literature, it was\ndecided to carry out a modeling of the $GMR(H)$ curves of\nferromagnetic/non-magnetic (FM/NM) multilayers with various interlayer\ncouplings. For simplicity, we focused on a trilayer structure (FM1/NM/FM2)\ncorresponding fairly well to the case of a large number of FM/NM bilayers. To\ncarry out the calculations, some fundamental assumptions were made: (i) single\ndomain FM layer, in plane magnetization; (ii) the magnetization of each layer\nis the same; (iii) the magnetization vectors rotate in the plane of the layers\nin an external magnetic field. In order to calculate the $GMR(H)$ function, we\nneed to know the magnetization process in the trilayer, i.e., the $M(H)$\nfunction. Therefore, first we calculate the equilibrium angle $\\phi(H)$ between\nthe two magnetization vectors as a function of the field by minimizing the\ntotal energy of the trilayer. According to most previous theoretical and\nexperimental works, the angular dependence of the GMR is fairly well described\nby the relation $GMR(\\phi)\\propto (1-\\cos\\phi)$ and we used this relation to\nderive the $GMR(H)$ function. Along this line, the $M(H)$ and $GMR(H)$ curves\nwere calculated for the following cases: (i) pure AF coupling; (ii) pure\northogonal coupling; (iii) AF coupling and orthogonal coupling simultaneously\npresent. As to the calculation of the $GMR(H)$ curves, some of these\nconfigurations have not yet been treated formerly or for some specific\nparameter values only.

For large-scale MIMO systems, accurate channel state\ninformation (CSI) acquisition is a challenging problem, especially when each\nuser has to distinguish and estimate numerous channels coming from a large\nnumber of transmit antennas in the downlink. Unlike the conventional orthogonal\npilots whose pilot overhead prohibitively increases with the number of transmit\nantennas, we propose a spectrum-efficient superimposed pilot design for\ndownlink large-scale MIMO scenarios, where frequency-domain pilots of different\ntransmit antennas occupy the completely same subcarriers in the freqency\ndomain. Meanwhile, spatial-temporal common sparsity of large-scale MIMO\nchannels motivates us to exploit the emerging theory of structured compressive\nsensing (CS) for reliable MIMO channel estimation, which is realized by the\nproposed structured subspace pursuit (SSP) algorithm to simultaneously recover\nmultiple channels with low pilot overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe proposed scheme performs well and can approach the performance bound.\n","Comment: 2 pages, 2 figures.\n  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6836737&tag=1"]}]
