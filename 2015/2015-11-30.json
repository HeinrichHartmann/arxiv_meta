The rapidly increasing\nnumber of applications has heightened interest in more compact comb generators.\nOptical microresonator based comb generators bear promise in this regard.\nCritical to their future use as 'frequency markers', is however the absolute\nfrequency stabilization of the optical comb spectrum. A powerful technique for\nthis stabilization is self-referencing, which requires a spectrum that spans a\nfull octave, i.e. a factor of two in frequency. In the case of mode locked\nlasers, overcoming the limited bandwidth has become possible only with the\nadvent of photonic crystal fibres for supercontinuum generation. Here, we\nreport for the first time the generation of an octave-spanning frequency comb\ndirectly from a toroidal microresonator on a silicon chip. The comb spectrum\ncovers the wavelength range from 990 nm to 2170 nm and is retrieved from a\ncontinuous wave laser interacting with the modes of an ultra high Q\nmicroresonator, without relying on external broadening. Full tunability of the\ngenerated frequency comb over a bandwidth exceeding an entire free spectral\nrange is demonstrated. This allows positioning of a frequency comb mode to any\ndesired frequency within the comb bandwidth. The ability to derive octave\nspanning spectra from microresonator comb generators represents a key step\ntowards achieving a radio-frequency to optical link on a chip, which could\nunify the fields of metrology with micro- and nano-photonics and enable\nentirely new devices that bring frequency metrology into a chip scale setting\nfor compact applications such as space based optical clocks.\n"]}]

The most obvious source for such a distribution is past data. The goal\nis to understand how much data is necessary and sufficient to guarantee\nnear-optimal expected revenue.\n  Our basic model is a single-item auction in which bidders' valuations are\ndrawn independently from unknown and non-identical distributions. The seller is\ngiven $m$ samples from each of these distributions \"for free\" and chooses an\nauction to run on a fresh sample. How large does m need to be, as a function of\nthe number k of bidders and eps > 0, so that a (1 - eps)-approximation of the\noptimal revenue is achievable?\n  We prove that, under standard tail conditions on the underlying\ndistributions, m = poly(k, 1/eps) samples are necessary and sufficient. Our\nlower bound stands in contrast to many recent results on simple and\nprior-independent auctions and fundamentally involves the interplay between\nbidder competition, non-identical distributions, and a very close (but still\nconstant) approximation of the optimal revenue. It effectively shows that the\nonly way to achieve a sufficiently good constant approximation of the optimal\nrevenue is through a detailed understanding of bidders' valuation\ndistributions. Our upper bound is constructive and applies in particular to a\nvariant of the empirical Myerson auction, the natural auction that runs the\nrevenue-maximizing auction with respect to the empirical distributions of the\nsamples.\n  Our sample complexity lower bound depends on the set of allowable\ndistributions, and to capture this we introduce alpha-strongly regular\ndistributions, which interpolate between the well-studied classes of regular\n(alpha = 0) and MHR (alpha = 1) distributions.

The proposed algorithm does not require\nany system statistics and asymptotically achieves the minimum system cost with\nlarge energy storage.

To achieve the perpetual\nnetwork operation and process the data with high importance, measured by Value\nof Information (VoI), the network has to operate under partial duty cycle and\nto improve the efficiency to consume the harvested energy. The challenging\nproblem is how to deal with the stochastic feature of the natural energy and\nthe variable data VoI. We consider the energy consumption during storing and\nthe diversity of the data process including sampling, transmitting and\nreceiving, which consume different power levels. The problem is then mapped as\nthe budget-dynamic Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) problem by treating the energy as the\nbudget and the data process as arm pulling.

The estimator improves\nupon existing methods by using an approximate second-order expansion of the\nparameter functional, in addition to the first-order expansion employed by\nstandard doubly robust methods. This results in weaker assumptions about the\nconvergence rates necessary to establish consistency, local efficiency, and\nasymptotic linearity. The general estimation strategy is developed under the\ntargeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) framework. We present a\nsimulation comparing the sensitivity of the first and second order estimators\nto the convergence rate of the initial estimators of the outcome regression and\nmissingness score. In our simulation, the second-order TMLE improved the\ncoverage probability of a confidence interval by up to 85%. In addition, we\npresent a first-order estimator inspired by a second-order expansion of the\nparameter functional. This estimator only requires one-dimensional smoothing,\nwhereas implementation of the second-order TMLE generally requires kernel\nsmoothing on the covariate space. The first-order estimator proposed is\nexpected to have improved finite sample performance compared to existing\nfirst-order estimators. In our simulations, the proposed first-order estimator\nimproved the coverage probability by up to 90%.

The quality of event\nlocality has been expressed as a metric called (weighted) event span. The\nbandwidth of a matrix is a metric indicating the distance of nonzero elements\nto the diagonal.

Since a few\nspecific cases have only been treated theoretically in the literature, it was\ndecided to carry out a modeling of the $GMR(H)$ curves of\nferromagnetic/non-magnetic (FM/NM) multilayers with various interlayer\ncouplings. For simplicity, we focused on a trilayer structure (FM1/NM/FM2)\ncorresponding fairly well to the case of a large number of FM/NM bilayers. To\ncarry out the calculations, some fundamental assumptions were made: (i) single\ndomain FM layer, in plane magnetization; (ii) the magnetization of each layer\nis the same; (iii) the magnetization vectors rotate in the plane of the layers\nin an external magnetic field. In order to calculate the $GMR(H)$ function, we\nneed to know the magnetization process in the trilayer, i.e., the $M(H)$\nfunction. Therefore, first we calculate the equilibrium angle $\\phi(H)$ between\nthe two magnetization vectors as a function of the field by minimizing the\ntotal energy of the trilayer. According to most previous theoretical and\nexperimental works, the angular dependence of the GMR is fairly well described\nby the relation $GMR(\\phi)\\propto (1-\\cos\\phi)$ and we used this relation to\nderive the $GMR(H)$ function. Along this line, the $M(H)$ and $GMR(H)$ curves\nwere calculated for the following cases: (i) pure AF coupling; (ii) pure\northogonal coupling; (iii) AF coupling and orthogonal coupling simultaneously\npresent. As to the calculation of the $GMR(H)$ curves, some of these\nconfigurations have not yet been treated formerly or for some specific\nparameter values only.
