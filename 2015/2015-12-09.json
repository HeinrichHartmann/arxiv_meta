The observed stellar spectrum was compared to a\ngrid of models from the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) grid. The best fit\ntemperature is 71 kK, and the atmospheric composition is dominated by helium\nwith an upper limit on the hydrogen abundance of 10 per cent. Our results are\nin very good agreement with the recent study of Todt et al., who determined a\nhydrogen fraction of 10 per cent and an unusually large nitrogen fraction of ~5\nper cent. This fraction is higher than any other low-mass H-deficient star, and\nis not readily explained by current post-AGB models. We give a discussion of\nthe implications of this discovery for the late-stage evolution of\nintermediate-mass stars. There is now tentative evidence for two distinct\nhelium-dominated post-AGB lineages, separate to the helium and carbon dominated\nsurface compositions produced by a late thermal pulse.

At low temperatures, these magnons lead to dramatic\neffects in many physical quantities such as density of states, specific heat,\nmagnetization, uniform susceptibility, staggered susceptibility and various\nspin correlation functions. The commensurate magnons lead to a pinned central\npeak in the angle resolved light or atom Bragg spectroscopy.

It has been conjectured to model low-energy dynamics of vortex\nsolitons in the presence of a Chern-Simons term, the k\\\"ahler manifold in\nquestion being the $n$-vortex moduli space. This paper presents a detailed\nstudy of RMG motion in soliton moduli spaces, focusing on the cases of\nhyperbolic vortices and spherical $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ lumps.

For planar vortices, it is shown that RMG flow differs from\nan earlier reduced dynamics proposed by Kim and Lee, and that the latter flow\nis ill-defined on the vortex coincidence set. An explicit formula for the\nmetric on the whole moduli space of hyperbolic two-vortices is computed\n(extending an old result of Strachan's), and RMG motion of centred two-vortices\nis studied in detail. Turning to lumps, the moduli space of static $n$-lumps is\n$Rat_n$, the space of degree $n$ rational maps, which is known to be k\\\"ahler\nand geodesically incomplete.

Due to Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), FPGA time-to-digital\nconverter (TDC) becomes one of mature and prominent time measurement methods in\nrecent years. For correcting time-walk effect caused by leading timing,\ntime-over-threshold (TOT) measurement should be added in the FPGA TDC.

This paper presents one method of TOT\nmeasurement implemented in a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. In this method, TOT measure\ncan be achieved in only one TDC input channel. The consumed resources and time\nresolution can both be guaranteed. Test shows that this TDC can achieve\nresolution better than 15 ps for leading edge measurement and 37 ps for TOT\nmeasurement.

We installed a 0.9 micron thick aluminized-mylar cathode as a way to\nreduce the probability of producing these backgrounds. We study three\ngenerations of cathode (wire, thin-film, and radiologically clean thin-film)\nwith a focus on the ratio of background events to alpha decays. Two independent\nmethods of measuring the absolute alpha decay rate are used to ensure an\naccurate result, and agree to within $10\\%$. Using alpha range spectroscopy, we\nmeasure the radiologically cleanest cathode version to have a contamination of\n$3.3\\pm0.1$ ppt $^{234}$U and $73\\pm2$ ppb $^{238}$U. This cathode reduces the\nprobability of producing an RPR from an alpha decay by a factor of $70\\pm20$\ncompared to the original stainless steel wire cathode. First results are\npresented from a texturized version of the cathode, intended to be even more\ntransparent to alpha particles. These efforts, along with other background\nreduction measures, have resulted in a drop in the observed background rate\nfrom 500/day to 1/day.

In this article we consider the shear-induced\nrupture of short DNA duplexes, a system that has been given new importance by\nrecently designed force sensors and nanotechnological devices. We argue that\nrupture must be understood as an activated process, where the duplex state is\nmetastable and the strands will separate in a finite time that depends on the\nduplex length and the force applied. Thus, the critical shearing force required\nto rupture a duplex within a given experiment depends strongly on the time\nscale of observation. We use simple models of DNA to demonstrate that this\napproach naturally captures the experimentally observed dependence of the\ncritical force on duplex length for a given observation time. In particular,\nthe critical force is zero for the shortest duplexes, before rising sharply and\nthen plateauing in the long length limit. The prevailing approach, based on\nidentifying when the presence of each additional base pair within the duplex is\nthermodynamically unfavorable rather than allowing for metastability, does not\npredict a time-scale-dependent critical force and does not naturally\nincorporate a critical force of zero for the shortest duplexes. Additionally,\nmotivated by a recently proposed force sensor, we investigate application of\nstress to a duplex in a mixed mode that interpolates between shearing and\nunzipping. As with pure shearing, the critical force depends on the time scale\nof observation; at a fixed time scale and duplex length, the critical force\nexhibits a sigmoidal dependence on the fraction of the duplex that is subject\nto shearing.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The proposed camera trigger is designed to select images\ninitiated by the Cherenkov emission of extended air showers from very-high\nenergy (VHE, E>20 GeV) photons and charged particles while suppressing\nsignatures from background light. The trigger comprises three stages. A first\nstage employs programmable discriminators to digitize the signals arriving from\nthe camera channels (pixels). At the second stage, a grid of low-cost FPGAs is\nused to process the digitized signals for camera regions with 37 pixels. At the\nthird stage, trigger conditions found independently in any of the overlapping\n37-pixel regions are combined into a global camera trigger by few central\nFPGAs. Trigger prototype boards based on Xilinx FPGAs have been designed, built\nand tested and were shown to function properly. Using these components a full\ncamera trigger with a power consumption and price per channel of about 0.5 W\nand 19 Euro, respectively, can be built. With the described design the camera\ntrigger algorithm can take advantage of pixel information in both the space and\nthe time domain allowing, for example, the creation of triggers sensitive to\nthe time-gradient of a shower image; the time information could also be\nexploited to online adjust the time window of the acquisition system for pixel\ndata.

EChO can target the atmospheres of super-Earths, Neptune-like, and\nJupiter-like planets, in the very hot to temperate zones (planet temperatures\nof 300K-3000K) of F to M-type host stars. Over the next ten years, several new\nground- and space-based transit surveys will come on-line (e.g. NGTS, CHEOPS,\nTESS, PLATO), which will specifically focus on finding bright, nearby systems.\nThe current rapid rate of discovery would allow the target list to be further\noptimised in the years prior to EChO's launch and enable the atmospheric\ncharacterisation of hundreds of planets. Placing the satellite at L2 provides a\ncold and stable thermal environment, as well as a large field of regard to\nallow efficient time-critical observation of targets randomly distributed over\nthe sky. A 1m class telescope is sufficiently large to achieve the necessary\nspectro-photometric precision.

PMMA/3-octanone has a UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) which\npresents a critical point at temperature Tc = 306.6 K and volume fraction\n$\\phi$c = 12.8 % [Crauste et al., ArXiv 1310.6720, 2012]. This oscillatory\nphenomenon appears because of thermophoretic and electrostriction effects and\nnon-linear diffusion. We analyze these oscillations and we propose a simple\nmodel which includes the minimal ingredients to produce the oscillatory\nbehavior. Phase transitions in binary mixtures are still a widely studied\nsubject, specifically near the critical point where several interesting and not\ncompletely understood phenomena may appear, among them we recall the critical\nCasimir forces [2],[3], confinement effects [4], [5] and out-of-equilibrium\ndynamics after a quench. The perturbation of the binary mixtures by mean of\nexternal fields is also an important and recent field of investigation [6]. For\nexample, a laser can induce interesting phenomena in demixing binary mixtures\nbecause the radiation pressure can deform the interface between the two phases\nand it can be used to measure the interface tension [7]. Depending on the\nnature of the binary mixtures, laser illumination can also lead to a mixing or\ndemixing transition. In ref.[8], focused infrared laser light heats the medium\ninitially in the homogeneous phase and causes a separation in the LCST (Low\nCritical Solution Temperature) system. The radiation pressure gradients in a\nlaser beam also contribute in the aggregation of polymers , thus producing a\nphase transition. The local heating may induce thermophoretic forces which\nattract towards the laser beam one of the binary-mixture components [9]. Other\nforces like electrostriction can also be involved [10]. In this letter, we\nreport a new phenomenon, which consists in an oscillating phase transition\ninduced by a constant illumination from an infrared laser beam in the\nheterogeneous region of an UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) binary\nmixture. Oscillation phenomena in phase transition have already been reported\nin slow cooling UCST [11],[12] but as far as we know, never induced by a\nstationary laser illumination. After describing our experimental setup , we\nwill present the results.

A key example is\nthe tomography of multiple ions states, employed in the validation of state\npreparation in ion trap experiments \\cite{Haffner2005}. Since full tomography\nbecomes unfeasible even for a small number of ions, there is a need to\ninvestigate lower dimensional statistical models which capture prior\ninformation about the state, and to devise estimation methods tailored to such\nmodels. In this paper we propose several new methods aimed at the efficient\nestimation of low rank states in multiple ions tomography. All methods consist\nin first computing the least squares estimator, followed by its truncation to\nan appropriately chosen smaller rank. The latter is done by setting eigenvalues\nbelow a certain \"noise level\" to zero, while keeping the rest unchanged, or\nnormalising them appropriately. We show that (up to logarithmic factors in the\nspace dimension) the mean square error of the resulting estimators scales as\n$r\\cdot d/N$ where $r$ is the rank, $d=2^k$ is the dimension of the Hilbert\nspace, and $N$ is the number of quantum samples. Furthermore we establish a\nlower bound for the asymptotic minimax risk which shows that the above scaling\nis optimal. The performance of the estimators is analysed in an extensive\nsimulations study, with emphasis on the dependence on the state rank, and the\nnumber of measurement repetitions.

The progenitor is a tight binary composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) core\nand a neutron star (NS) companion, a subclass of the newly proposed\n\"ultra-stripped\" binaries. The CO-NS short-period orbit causes the NS to\naccrete appriciable matter from the SN ejecta when the CO core collapses,\nultimately causing it to collapse to a black hole (BH) and producing a GRB.\nThese tight binaries evolve through the SN explosion very differently than\ncompact binaries studied in population synthesis calculations. First, the\nhypercritical accretion onto the NS companion alters both the mass and momentum\nof the binary. Second, because the explosion timescale is on par with the\norbital period, the mass ejection can not be assumed to be instantaneous. This\ndramatically affects the post-SN fate of the binary.

These systems remain bound even if a large\nfraction of the binary mass is lost in the explosion (well above the canonical\n50\\% limit), and even large kicks are unlikely to unbind the system. Indeed,\nBdHNe produce a new family of NS-BH binaries unaccounted for in current\npopulation synthesis analyses and, although they may be rare, the fact that\nnearly 100\\% remain bound implies they may play an important role in the\ncompact merger rate, important for gravitational waves (GWs) that, in turn, can\nproduce a new class of ultrashort GRBs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters"]}]

The trivial path is stabilized by\nsupergravity corrections and supports a first stage of inflation with a limited\nnumber of e-foldings. The tensor-to-scalar ratio can become appreciable while\nthe value of the scalar spectral index remains acceptable as a result of the\ncompetition between the relatively mild supergravity corrections and the strong\nradiative corrections to the inflationary potential.

The\nstrength of these social influences are controlled by two parameters: $F$, the\nnumber of features that characterizes the cultures and $q$, the common number\nof states each feature can assume. Here we assume that the innovation is a new\nstate of a cultural feature of a single individual -- the innovator -- and\nstudy how the innovation spreads through the networks among the individuals.\nFor infinite regular lattices in one (1D) and two dimensions (2D), we find that\ninitially the successful innovation spreads linearly with the time $t$, but in\nthe long-time limit it spreads diffusively ($\\sim t^{1/2}$) in 1D and\nsub-diffusively ($\\sim t/\\ln t$) in 2D. For finite lattices, the growth curves\nfor the number of adopters are typically concave functions of $t$.

Regardless of the size\nof the strain-window considered in the measurements, we show that the\nTsallis-Bukman scaling law remains valid, which is the first experimental\nverification of this relationship for a classical system at different diffusion\nregimes. We also note that the spatial correlations show marked similarities to\nthe turbulence in fluids, a promising indication that this type of analysis can\nbe used to explore the origins of the macroscopic friction in confined granular\nmaterials.\n","Comment: 8 pages 4 figures"]}]

Whether a product is selected in a market crucially relates to\nits competitiveness, but the selection in turn affects the landscape of\ncompetition. Such a feedback mechanism has been illustrated in a duopoly model\nby Lambert et al., in which a buyer's satisfaction is updated depending on the\n{\\em freshness} of a purchased product. The probability for buyer $n$ to select\nseller $i$ is assumed to be $p_{n,i} \\propto e^{ S_{n,i}/T}$, where $S_{n,i}$\nis the buyer's satisfaction and $T$ is an effective temperature to introduce\nstochasticity.

In this work, we extend the model by\nincorporating a simple price system. By considering a greed factor $g$ to\ncontrol how the satisfaction depends on the price, we argue the existence of an\noscillatory phase in addition to the symmetric and asymmetric ones in the\n$(T,g)$ plane, and estimate the phase boundaries through mean-field\napproximations.

To achieve fields strong enough to seed the\ngalactic dynamo, most of the mechanisms operate outside conventional\nelectromagnetic theory. The latter is typically restored after the end of the\nde Sitter phase. Breaking away from standard electromagnetism can lead to\nsubstantially stronger magnetic fields by the end of inflation, thus\ncompensating for the their subsequent adiabatic depletion. We argue that the\ndrastic magnetic enhancement during the de Sitter era may no longer be\nnecessary because, contrary to the widespread perception, superhorizon-sized\nmagnetic fields decay at a slower pace after inflation. The principle behind\nthis claim is causality, which confines the post-inflationary electric currents\ninside the horizon. Without the currents there can be no magnetic-flux freezing\non super-Hubble lengths. There, the magnetic decay-rate slows down, thus making\nit much easier to produce primordial fields of astrophysical interest. To\nquantify this qualitative statement, one can start from the current\ngalactic-dynamo requirements and `reverse engineer' the magnetic strengths\nneeded at the end of inflation, in order to produce astrophysically relevant\nresidual seeds today.

One of the most fundamental issues is to\nwhich extent these properties can be described by the superexchange (SE) model,\nformulated in the limit of the large Coulomb repulsion. In the present work we\naddress this issue by deriving the relevant models and extracting parameters of\nthese models from the first-principles calculations. First, we construct the\neffective Hubbard-type model for the t2g bands, by recasting the problem in the\nlanguage of Wannier orbitals. Then, we map the obtained electron model onto the\npseudospin model by applying the theory of SE interactions. We discuss the\nmicroscopic origin of anisotropic SE interactions, inherent to the compass\nHeisenberg model, and the appearance of the antisymmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\nterm, associated with the additional rotation of the IrO6 octahedra in Sr2IrO4.\nIn order to evaluate the Neel temperature (TN), we employ the non-linear sigma\nmodel. While for Sr2IrO4 our value of TN agrees with the experimental one, for\nBa2IrO4 it is overestimated by a factor two. We argue that this discrepancy is\nrelated to limitations of the SE model: while for more localized t2g states in\nSr2IrO4 it works reasonably well, the higher-order terms, beyond the SE model,\nplay a more important role in the more \"itinerant\" Ba2IrO4, giving rise to the\nnew type of isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions.

Recently\na general technique of restoration of rhythmicity in diffusively coupled\nnetworks of nonlinear oscillators has been proposed in [Zou et al. Nature\nCommun. 6:7709, 2015], where it is shown that a proper feedback parameter that\ncontrols the rate of diffusion can effectively revive oscillation from an\noscillation suppressed state. In this paper we show that the mean-field\ndiffusive coupling, which can suppress oscillation even in a network of\nidentical oscillators, can be modified in order to revoke the cessation of\noscillation induced by it. Using a rigorous bifurcation analysis we show that,\nunlike other diffusive coupling schemes, here one has {\\it two control\nparameters}, namely the {\\it density of the mean-field} and the {\\it feedback\nparameter} that can be controlled to revive oscillation from a death state.

Using the \"Tool for Astrophysical Data Analysis\" (TA-DA), we create\nvarious theoretical isochrones applying different combinations of interior and\natmospheric models. We compare the isochrones with the observed Hyades\nsingle-star sequence on J vs. J - K_s, J vs. J - H and K_s vs. H - K_s\ncolor-magnitude diagrams.

The primary limitations are the uncertainties in the\nmeasurement of the distance to individual Hyades members, and uncertainties in\nthe photometry.

The sub-filaments are dynamical features formed at the stagnation\npoints of the turbulent velocity field where shocks dissipate the turbulent\nenergy. They are a ubiquitous feature of the simulated clouds, which appear\nfrom the beginning of the simulation and are not formed by gradual\nfragmentation of larger filaments. Most of the sub-filaments are\ngravitationally sub-critical and do not fragment into cores, however, there is\nalso a significant fraction of supercritical sub-filaments which break up into\nstar-forming cores. The sub-filaments are coherent along their length, and the\nresidual velocities along their spine show that they are subsonically\ncontracting without any ordered rotation on scales of ~0.1 pc. Accretion flows\nalong the sub-filaments can feed material into star forming cores embedded\nwithin the network. The overall mass in sub-filaments and the number of\nsub-filaments increases as the cloud evolves. We propose that the formation of\nfilaments and sub-filaments is a natural consequence of the turbulent cascade\nin the complex multi-phase interstellar medium. Sub-filaments are formed by the\nhigh wavenumber, small scale modes in the turbulent velocity field.

The sight-lines with non-detections trace the\nextent of the Local Bubble especially clearly, and show it opening out into the\nHalo. The Local Bubble has a wall which is in contact with hot gas and/or a\nharsh interstellar radiation field. That wall is perforated though, causing\nleakage of radiation and possibly hot gas. On the other hand, compact\nself-shielded cloudlets are present much closer to the Sun, probably within the\nLocal Bubble itself. As for the carriers of the DIBs, our observations confirm\nthe notion that these are large molecules, whose differences in behaviour are\nmainly governed by their differing resilience and/or electrical charge, with\nmore subtle differences possibly related to varying excitation.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

We use the Kepler data accumulated on the pulsating DB white dwarf KIC\n08626021 to explore in detail the stability of its oscillation modes, searching\nin particular for evidences of nonlinear behaviors. Methods. We analyse nearly\ntwo years of uninterrupted short cadence data, concentrating in particular on\nidentified triplets due to stellar rotation that show intriguing behaviors\nduring the course of the observations. Results. We find clear signatures of\nnonlinear effects attributed to resonant mode coupling mechanisms. We find that\na triplet at 4310 {\\mu}Hz and this doublet at 3681 {\\mu}Hz (most likely the two\nvisible components of an incomplete triplet) have clear periodic frequency and\namplitude modulations typical of the so-called intermediate regime of the\nresonance, with time scales consistent with theoretical expectations. Another\ntriplet at 5073 {\\mu}Hz is likely in a narrow transitory regime in which the\namplitudes are modulated while the frequencies are locked. Using nonadiabatic\npulsation calculations based on a model representative of KIC 08626021 to\nevaluate the linear growth rates of the modes in the triplets, we also provide\nquantitative information that could be useful for future comparisons with\nnumerical solutions of the amplitude equations.

These should resonate as a warning to projects\naiming at measuring the evolutionary cooling rate of KIC 08626021, and of white\ndwarf stars in general. Nonlinear modulations of the frequencies can\npotentially jeopardize any attempt to measure reliably such rates, unless they\ncould be corrected beforehand.

Hence, we review\nthe current state of bulge formation in cosmological simulations, and discuss\nopen questions that can be addressed in the near future by simulators, with a\nparticular focus on merger-driven bulge growth. Galaxy mergers have long been\nassumed to produce classical bulges in disk galaxies. Under this\nbulge-formation model, though, the high rates of mergers in Cold Dark Matter\ngalaxy formation theory predict many more classical bulges than are observed.\nFurthermore, simulations of galaxy formation continue to generally produce too\nmassive of bulges. Feedback offers a promising avenue for reducing\nmerger-driven bulge growth by maintaining high gas fractions in galaxies and\nejecting low-angular momentum gas driven to the centers of galaxies. After\nreviewing the results of relevant research that has been published to date, we\nuse cosmological simulations to explore the ability of feedback to reduce or\neven prevent bulge growth during mergers. In dwarf galaxies, mergers actually\nreduce the central concentration of galaxies as the induced burst of star\nformation drives out low angular momentum material. This result shows the\npotential for feedback to reduce central mass growth. However, we also\ndemonstrate that it is very difficult for current stellar feedback models to\nreproduce the small bulges observed in more massive disk galaxies like the\nMilky Way. We argue that feedback models need to be improved, or an additional\nsource of feedback such as AGN is necessary to generate the required outflows.\n","Comment: The first 5 sections are review, but Section 6 introduces new\n  analysis.

Typically this\ntransition manifests itself as a large voltage jump at a particular current\ndensity, so-called instability current density $J^*$, which is smaller than the\ndepairing current. By tuning the effective pinning strength in Al films, using\nan artificial periodic pinning array of triangular holes, we show that a unique\nand well defined instability current density exists if the pinning is strong,\nwhereas a series of multiple voltage transitions appear in the relatively\nweaker pinning regime. This behavior is consistent with time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau simulations, where the multiple-step transition can be\nunambiguously attributed to the progressive development of vortex chains and\nsubsequently phase-slip lines.
