In this\nwork we investigate the evolution of these properties with increasing number of\nlayers (n) ranging from 1 to 10.

We observe that there exist strong\ninter-layer covalent bondings between the layers in multi-layers of silicene as\nopposed to weak van der Waal's bonding which exists between the graphene\nlayers. The inter-layer bonding strongly influences the geometric and\nelectronic structures of these multi-layers. Like bi-layers of graphene,\nsilicene with two different stacking configurations AA and AB exhibits linear\nand parabolic dispersions around the Fermi level, respectively. However, unlike\ngraphene, for bi-layers of silicene, these dispersion curves are shifted in\nband diagram; this is due to the strong inter-layer bonding present in the\nlatter.

Winds from\nthe accretion disk are required to eject significant mass to suppress black\nhole growth, but there is no need for coupling this wind to galactic-scale gas\nto regulate black holes in a non-linear feedback loop. Torque-limited growth\nyields a close-to-linear relation for the star formation rate and the black\nhole accretion rate averaged over galaxy evolution time scales. However, the\nSFR-AGN connection has significant scatter owing to strong variability of black\nhole accretion at all resolved time scales.

In topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), a\nspontaneously generated Dirac gap was recently observed, which was ascribed to\nbroken cubic crystal symmetry. However, this structural distortion has not been\ndirectly observed so far, and the microscopic mechanism of Dirac gap opening\nvia crystal symmetry breaking remains elusive. In this work, we present\nscanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements of a TCI Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se\nfor a wide range of alloy compositions spanning the topological and\nnon-topological regimes. STM topographies directly reveal a symmetry-breaking\ndistortion on the surface, which imparts mass to the otherwise massless Dirac\nelectrons - a mechanism analogous to the long sought-after Higgs mechanism in\nparticle physics. Remarkably, our measurements show that the Dirac gap scales\nwith alloy composition, while the magnitude of the distortion remains nearly\nconstant. Based on theoretical calculations, we find the Dirac mass is\ncontrolled by the composition-dependent SS penetration depth, which determines\nthe weight of SS in the distorted region that is confined to the surface.\nFinally, we discover the existence of SS in the non-topological regime, which\nhave the characteristics of gapped, double-branched Dirac fermions.\n"]}]

In many\ncases, genes blocks are conserved between bacterial species, sometimes as\noperons, when genes are co-transcribed. The conservation is rarely absolute:\ngene loss, gain, duplication, block splitting, and block fusion are frequently\nobserved. An open question in bacterial molecular evolution is that of the\nformation and breakup of gene blocks, for which several models have been\nproposed. These models, however, are not generally applicable to all types of\ngene blocks, and consequently cannot be used to broadly compare and study gene\nblock evolution. To address this problem we introduce an event-based method for\ntracking gene block evolution in bacteria. Results: We show here that the\nevolution of gene blocks in proteobacteria can be described by a small set of\nevents. Those include the insertion of genes into, or the splitting of genes\nout of a gene block, gene loss, and gene duplication. We show how the\nevent-based method of gene block evolution allows us to determine the\nevolutionary rate, and to trace the ancestral states of their formation. We\nconclude that the event-based method can be used to help us understand the\nformation of these important bacterial genomic structures.

Building upon one-time pad, secrecy coding, and broadcasting\nschemes, achievable rate regions are investigated, and the capacity region for\nspecial cases of either a weak or strong eavesdropper (compared to both\nlegitimate receivers) are characterized. Interestingly, the capacity region for\nthe former corresponds to a line and the latter corresponds to a square with\nmissing corners; a phenomenon occurring due to the coupling between user's\nrates. Moreover, the individual secrecy capacity region is also fully\ncharacterized for the case where the eavesdropper's channel is deterministic.\nIn addition to discrete memoryless setup, Gaussian scenarios are studied. For\nthe Gaussian model, in addition to the strong and weak eavesdropper cases, the\ncapacity region is characterized for the low and high SNR regimes when the\neavesdropper's channel is stronger than one receiver but weaker than the other.\nRemarkably, positive secure transmission rates are always guaranteed under the\nindividual secrecy constraint, unlike the case of the joint secrecy constraint\n(i.e., the information leakage from both messages to the eavesdropper is made\nvanishing).

This paper proposes a novel unified framework that jointly\nexploits the feature relationships and the class relationships for improved\ncategorization performance.

Through arming the DNN with better capability of harnessing both\nthe feature and the class relationships, the proposed rDNN is more suitable for\nmodeling video semantics.
