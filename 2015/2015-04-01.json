The transition\namplitude for a spacetimesource element is computed using a path integral with\ndiscrete graphical action.

Thermal transport at the nanoscale is fundamentally\ndifferent from that at the macroscale and is determined by the distribution of\ncarrier mean free paths in a material, the length scales of the heat sources,\nand the distance over which heat is transported. Past work has shown that\nFourier's law for heat conduction dramatically over-predicts the rate of heat\ndissipation from heat sources with dimensions smaller than the mean free path\nof the dominant heat-carrying phonons. In this work, we uncover a new regime of\nnanoscale thermal transport that dominates when the separation between\nnanoscale heat sources is small compared with the dominant phonon mean free\npaths. Surprisingly, the interplay between neighboring heat sources can\nfacilitate efficient, diffusive-like heat dissipation, even from the smallest\nnanoscale heat sources.

The\nstaticity and non-stationarity of these two different forms are traced back to\nthe noncomoving and comoving nature of the corresponding coordinate systems. In\nthis paper using the quasi-Maxwell form of the Einstein field equations and a\ndefinition of static spacetimes based upon them, we look at these two different\nforms of the same solution from a new perspective which classifies them as a\nspecial case in a general one-parameter family of solutions. Specifically it is\nproved that, {\\it irrespective of the spacetime symmetry, a one-element perfect\nfluid in any frame noncomoving with the fluid could be the source of a static\nspacetime, only if its equation of state is that of a dark fluid namely $p =\n-\\rho = const.$}. These static solutions, which include the well-known de\nSitter spacetime, are called de Sitter-type spacetimes. To exemplify we\nconsider static axially and cylindrically symmetric de Sitter-type spacetimes\nand their dynamic (cosmological) versions. It is shown how despite the\nseemingly natural expectation based on the presence of $\\Lambda$ as their only\nparameter, the nonspherical expansions of these genuinely different solutions\nshould be expected indeed.

Specifically, the UA is\nmodeled as a continuous circular/spherical array enclosing target users and\nfree-space propagation is assumed. First, consider the estimation of multiuser\nUA channels induced by user locations. Given single pilot symbols, a novel\nchannel estimation scheme is proposed that decomposes training signals into\nFourier/Laplace series and thereby translates multiuser channel estimation into\npeak detection of a derive function of location. The process is shown to\nsuppress noise. Moreover, it is proved that estimation error due to\ninterference diminishes with the increasing minimum user-separation distance\nfollowing the power law, where the exponent is 1/3 and 1 for the circular and\nspherical UA, respectively. If orthogonal pilot sequences are used, channel\nestimation is found to be perfect. Next, consider channel-conjugate data\ntransmission that maximizes received signal power. The power of interference\nbetween two users is shown to decay with the increasing user-separation\ndistance sub-linearly and super-linearly for the circular and spherical UA,\nrespectively. Furthermore, a novel multiuser precoding design is proposed by\nexciting different phase modes of the UA and controlling the mode weight\nfactors to null interference.

In contrast to previous\nassumptions the plasma density does not follow a quadratic dependence on the\ndriving frequency in this non-local collisionless regime. Instead, a step-like\nincrease at a distinct driving frequency is observed. Based on the analytical\npower balance model, in combination with a detailed analysis of the electron\nkinetics, the density jump is found to be caused by an electron heating mode\ntransition from the classical $\\alpha$-mode into a low density resonant heating\nmode characterized by the generation of two energetic electron beams at each\nelectrode per sheath expansion phase. These electron beams propagate through\nthe bulk without collisions and interact with the opposing sheath. In the low\ndensity mode, the second beam is found to hit the opposing sheath during its\ncollapse. Consequently, a high number of energetic electrons is lost at the\nelectrodes resulting in a poor confinement of beam electrons in contrast to the\nclassical $\\alpha$-mode observed at higher driving frequencies. Based on the\nanalytical model this modulated confinement quality and the related modulation\nof the energy lost per electron lost at the electrodes is demonstrated to cause\nthe step-like change of the plasma density.

In the limit of large driving\nfrequency, the long-time dynamics of such systems can often be described by a\ntime-independent effective Hamiltonian, which is generally identified through a\nperturbative treatment. Here, we present a general formalism that describes\ntime-modulated physical systems, in which the driving frequency is large, but\nresonant with respect to energy spacings inherent to the system at rest. Such a\nsituation is currently exploited in optical-lattice setups, where superlattice\n(or Wannier-Stark-ladder) potentials are resonantly modulated so as to control\nthe tunneling matrix elements between lattice sites, offering a powerful method\nto generate artificial fluxes for cold-atom systems. The formalism developed in\nthis work identifies the basic ingredients needed to generate interesting flux\npatterns and band structures using resonant modulations. Additionally, our\napproach allows for a simple description of the micro-motion underlying the\ndynamics; we illustrate its characteristics based on diverse dynamic-lattice\nconfigurations.

Six spectral models, three simple and three more\ncomplex models, were implemented and applied to the spectral data. Simple\nmodels are applied to all sources, whereas complex models are applied to\nobservations with more than 500 counts (30%). XMMFITCAT includes best-fit\nparameters and errors, fluxes, and goodness of fit estimates for all fitted\nmodels. XMMFITCAT has been conceived to provide the astronomical community with\na tool to construct large and representative samples of X-ray sources by\nallowing source selection according to spectral properties, as well as\ncharacterise the X-ray properties of samples selected in different wavelengths.\nWe present in this paper the main details of the construction of this database,\nand summarise its main characteristics.\n","Comment: To appear in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 12 pages, 11 figures"]}]

The material\npresented here results from thorough discussions within the community over the\npast four years, building on the past competitive studies to agree a common\nstrategy toward realising a MOS capability on the E-ELT. The cases have been\ndistilled to a set of common requirements which will be used to define the\nMOSAIC instrument, entailing two observational modes ('high multiplex' and\n'high definition'). When combined with the unprecedented sensitivity of the\nE-ELT, MOSAIC will be the world's leading MOS facility.

Correcting for these lines,\nmostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on\nobservations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the\nscience targets, therefore using precious observing time. Aims: We present\nmolecfit, a tool for correcting for telluric absorption lines based on\nsynthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is\nversatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based\ntelescopes and instruments. Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available\nradiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and\nvarious kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric\nprofiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative\nof a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of\ndynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and\nhumidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability,\nand its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on\nspectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.\nResults: Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results\nfor temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory\ninto account. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after\ncorrection of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2% of the\ncontinuum.

In\nprinciple, it may be employed in any modeling situation, say forecasting the\nweather or the stock market--it is up to experiment to determine if this\nextension is useful in practice. Even restricting to the domain of quantum\nmechanics, with this new formulation the advantages of Bayesian networks can be\nmaintained for models incorporating quantum and mixed classical-quantum\nbehavior. The use of these will be illustrated by various basic examples.\n  Parrondo's paradox refers to the situation where two, multi-round games with\na fixed winning criteria, both with probability greater than one-half for one\nplayer to win, are combined. Using a possibly biased coin to determine the rule\nto employ for each round, paradoxically, the previously losing player now wins\nthe combined game with probability greater than one-half.

The URS includes efficient DMUs that are\nactive in a specific convex combination producing the projection. Because of\nthe occurrence of multiple URSs, we introduce the notion of maximal reference\nset (MRS) and define it as the union of all the URSs associated with the given\nprojection.

In\nsuch protocols, when an agent $a$ of type (species) $i$ interacts with an agent\n$b$ of type (species) $j$ with $a$ as the initiator, then $b$'s type becomes\n$i$ with probability $P\\_{ij}$. In such an interaction, we think of $a$ as the\npredator, $b$ as the prey, and the type of the prey is either converted to that\nof the predator or stays as is. Such protocols capture the dynamics of some\nopinion spreading models and generalize the well-known Rock-Paper-Scissors\ndiscrete dynamics. We consider the pairwise interactions among agents that are\nscheduled uniformly at random. We start by considering the convergence time and\nshow that any Lotka-Volterra-type protocol on an $n$-agent population converges\nto some absorbing state in time polynomial in $n$, w.h.p., when any pair of\nagents is allowed to interact. By contrast, when the interaction graph is a\nstar, even the Rock-Paper-Scissors protocol requires exponential time to\nconverge. We then study threshold effects exhibited by Lotka-Volterra-type\nprotocols with 3 and more species under interactions between any pair of\nagents. We start by presenting a simple 4-type protocol in which the\nprobability difference of reaching the two possible absorbing states is\nstrongly amplified by the ratio of the initial populations of the two other\ntypes, which are transient, but \"control\" convergence. We then prove that the\nRock-Paper-Scissors protocol reaches each of its three possible absorbing\nstates with almost equal probability, starting from any configuration\nsatisfying some sub-linear lower bound on the initial size of each species.\nThat is, Rock-Paper-Scissors is a realization of a \"coin-flip consensus\" in a\ndistributed system. Some of our techniques may be of independent value.\n"]}]
