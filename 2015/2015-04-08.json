This point of view naturally leads to the\ndefinition of communicability in terms of matrix functions, such as the\nexponential, resolvent, and hyperbolic functions, in which the matrix argument\nis either the adjacency matrix or the graph Laplacian associated with the\nnetwork. Considerable insight on communicability can be gained by modeling a\nnetwork as a system of oscillators and deriving physical interpretations, both\nclassical and quantum-mechanical, of various communicability functions.\nApplications of communicability measures to the analysis of complex systems are\nillustrated on a variety of biological, physical and social networks.

The interesting aspect of such\na construction is that even though the topological building blocks in the low\ndimension may be gapped, the higher dimensional semimetallic phase emerges as a\ngapless critical point of a topological phase transition between two distinct\ninsulating phases. In this work, we extend this idea by constructing\nthree-dimensional topological semimetallic phases akin to Weyl systems by\nstacking one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) lattice tight binding models\nwith non-trivial topology. The generalized AAH model is a family of one\ndimensional tight binding models with cosine modulations in both hopping and\nonsite energy terms. In this paper, we present a two-parameter generalization\nof the AAH model that can access topological phases in three dimensions within\na unified framework. We show that the $\\pi$-flux state of this two-parameter\nAAH model manifests three dimensional topological semimetallic phases where the\ntopological features are embedded in one dimension. The topological nature of\nthe band touching points of the semimetallic phase in 3D is explicitly\nestablished both analytically and numerically from the 1D perspective. This\ndimensional reduction provides a simple protocol to experimentally construct\nthe three dimensional Brillouin zone of the topological semimetallic phases\nusing `legos' of simple 1D double well optical lattices. We also propose Zak\nphase imaging of optical lattices as a tool to capture the topological nature\nof the band touching points. Our work provides a theoretical connection between\nthe commensurate AAH model in 1D and Weyl semimetals in 3D, and points toward\npractical methods for the laboratory realization of such three dimensional\ntopological systems in atomic optical lattices.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures, Published version with revised title,\n  introduction and improved presentation"]}]

The meson masses in this model are in very good agreement with lattice\ngauge theory calculations in the quenched approximation.

This provides an explanation for the\nagreement of holographic and quenched lattice gauge theory calculations. We\nthen study the `Dynamic AdS/QCD model' in which the gauge theory dynamics is\nincluded by a choice for the running of gamma.

A resonant orbit is defined as a geodesic for which the longitudinal\nand radial orbital frequencies are commensurate. Our analysis is based on\nexpressing the resonance condition in its most symmetric form using Carlson's\nintegrals. We provide a number of concise formulae for the dependence of\nresonances on the system parameters. Resonant effects may be observable during\nthe in-spiral of a compact object into a super-massive black hole. When the\nslowly evolving orbital frequencies pass through a series of low-order\nresonances, rapid changes in the orbital parameters could produce measurable\nphase shifts in the emitted gravitational radiation (GW). Resonant orbits may\nalso capture dust leading to electromagnetic emission. The KAM theorem\nindicates that, low order resonant orbits demarcate the regions where the onset\nof chaos could occur around a perturbed black-hole. We find that the 1/2 and\n2/3 resonances occur at ~4 and 5.4 Schwarzschild radii (Rs) from the event\nhorizon. For compact object in-spirals around super-massive black holes, this\nregion lies within the sensitivity band of space-based GW detectors. For Sgr\nA*, length scales of ~41 and 55 microarcseconds and timescales of 50 and 79 min\nrespectively should be associated with resonant effects, if Sgr A* is\nnon-spinning. Spin decreases these values by up to ~32% and ~28%. These\nlength-scales are potentially resolvable with VLBI measurements. We find that\nall low-order resonances are localized to the strong field region r < 50 Rs.\nThis fact guarantees the validity of using approximations based on averaging to\nmodel the frequency evolution of a test object in region 50 Rs <r <1000 Rs.

Some argue for an early Moon-forming\nevent, approximately 30 million years (Myr) after the condensation of the first\nsolids in the Solar System, whereas others claim a date later than 50 Myr (and\npossibly as late as around 100 My) after condensation. Here we show that a\nMoon-forming event at 40 Myr after condensation, or earlier, is ruled out at a\n99.9 per cent confidence level. We use a large number of N-body simulations to\ndemonstrate a relationship between the time of the last giant impact on an\nEarth-like planet and the amount of mass subsequently added during the era\nknown as Late Accretion. As the last giant impact is delayed, the late-accreted\nmass decreases in a predictable fashion. This relationship exists within both\nthe classical scenario and the Grand Tack scenario of terrestrial planet\nformation, and it holds across a wide range of disk conditions. The\nconcentration of highly siderophile elements (HSEs) in Earth's mantle\nconstrains the mass of chondritic material added to Earth during Late\nAccretion. Using HSE abundance measurements, we determine a Moon-formation age\nof 95 +/- 32 Myr since condensation. The possibility exists that some late\nprojectiles were differentiated and left an incomplete HSE record in Earth's\nmantle. Even in this case, various isotopic constraints strongly suggest that\nthe late-accreted mass did not exceed 1 per cent of Earth's mass, and so the\nHSE clock still robustly limits the timing of the Moon-forming event to\nsignificantly later than 40 My after condensation.\n","Comment: Includes Supplemental Material"]}]

A stochastic process associated with the non-equilibrium\npart of the spectrum is characterized in terms of its central moments or\ncumulants, which may vary over time. This parameterization encodes information\nabout the non-equilibrium behavior of the system.\n  Stochastic time-series spectroscopy (STSS) can be implemented at very little\nexpense in many settings since a series of scans are typically recorded in\norder to generate a low-noise averaged spectrum. Higher moments or cumulants\nmay be readily calculated from this series, enabling the observation of\nquantities that would be difficult or impossible to determine from an average\nspectrum or from prinicipal components analysis (PCA).\n  This method is more scalable than PCA, having linear time complexity, yet it\ncan produce comparable or superior results, as shown in example applications.\nOne example compares an STSS-derived CO$_2$ bending mode to a standard\nreference spectrum and the result of PCA. A second example shows that STSS can\nreveal conditions of stress in rocks, a scenario where traditional methods such\nas PCA are inadequate. This allows spectral lines and non-equilibrium behavior\nto be precisely resolved. A relationship between 2nd order STSS and a\ntime-varying form of PCA is considered.

The signal pick-up is obtained by\nmeans of strips facing one side of the gas volume.

In order to\nfully investigate the 1-10 PeV region, an analog readout has been implemented\nby instrumenting each RPC with two large size electrodes facing the other side\nof the gas volume. Since December 2009 the RPC charge readout has been in\noperation on the entire central carpet (about 5800 m^2).

These\nconstraints are handled by a flash translation layer (FTL), which performs\nout-of-place updates, wear-leveling and garbage-collection behind the scene,\nwhile offering the application a virtualization of the physical address space.\n  A class of relevant FTLs employ a flash-resident page-associative mapping\ntable from logical to physical addresses, with a smaller RAM-resident cache for\nfrequently mapped entries.

Along $\\overline{\\Gamma}$$\\overline{\\rm M}$, the\ndispersion deviates from a linear behavior meaning that the Dirac cone is\nwarped outwards and not inwards.

Based on the theoretically predicted behavior of the ground-state spin\ntexture of a strongly warped Dirac cone, we propose spin-dependent scattering\nprocesses as explanation for the anisotropic scattering rates.
