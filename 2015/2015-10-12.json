For this purpose we use\ncollisionless N-body simulations of dwarfs initially composed of a disk\nembedded in an NFW dark matter halo. The dwarfs are placed on seven orbits\naround the Milky Way-like host, differing in size and eccentricity, and their\nevolution is followed for 10 Gyr. In addition to the well-studied morphological\nand dynamical transformation of the dwarf's main body, the tidal stripping\ncauses them to lose a substantial fraction of mass both in dark matter and\nstars which form pronounced tidal tails. We focus on the properties of the\nstellar component of the tidal tails thus formed. We first discuss the break\nradii in the stellar density profile defining the transition to tidal tails as\nthe radii where the profile becomes shallower and relate them to the\nclassically defined tidal radii. We then calculate the relative density and\nvelocity of the tails at a few break radii as a function of the orbital phase.\nNext, we measure the orientation of the tails with respect to an observer\nplaced at the centre of the Milky Way. The tails are perpendicular to this line\nof sight only for a short period of time near the pericentre. For most of the\ntime the angles between the tails and this line of sight are low, with\norbit-averaged medians below 42 degrees for all, even the almost circular\norbit. The median angle is typically lower while the maximum relative density\nhigher for more eccentric orbits. The combined effects of relative density and\norientation of the tails suggest that they should be easiest to detect for\ndwarf galaxies soon after their pericentre passage.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, published in MNRAS"]}]

One can then easily deduce properties of $Cu$ from\nrespective properties of $W$, e.g. the existence of tensor products and\ninductive limits. The advantage is that constructions in $W$ are much easier\nsince the objects are purely algebraic.\n  We also develop a theory of $Cu$-semirings and their semimodules. The Cuntz\nsemigroup of a strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra has a natural product giving\nit the structure of a $Cu$-semiring. We give explicit characterizations of\n$Cu$-semimodules over such $Cu$-semirings. For instance, we show that a\n$Cu$-semigroup $S$ tensorially absorbs the $Cu$-semiring of the Jiang-Su\nalgebra if and only if $S$ is almost unperforated and almost divisible, thus\nestablishing a semigroup version of the Toms-Winter conjecture.\n","Comment: 195 pages; revised version; several proofs streamlined; some results\n  corrected, in particular added 5.2.3-5.2.6"]}]

Since the theory\nis linear, Green-function techniques enable one to write the field of a charged\npoint particle on Minkowski spacetime as an integral over the particle's\nhistory. By introducing the notion of timelike worldlines that are \"bounded\naway from the backward light-cone\" we are able to prescribe criteria for the\nconvergence of such integrals. We also exhibit a timelike worldline yielding\nsingular fields on a lightlike hyperplane in spacetime. In this case the field\nis mildly singular at the event where the particle crosses the hyperplane. Even\nin the case when the Bopp-Podolsky field is bounded, it exhibits a directional\ndiscontinuity as one approaches the point particle.

These emergent behaviours can be verified to\nassess their correctness, through techniques like model checking. Model\nchecking exhaustively explores all possible behaviours, based on a discrete\nmodel of the system, such as a swarm in a grid. A common problem in model\nchecking is the state-space explosion that arises when the states of the model\nare numerous. We propose a novel implementation of symmetry reduction, in the\nform of encoding navigation algorithms relatively with respect to a reference,\nbased on the symmetrical properties of swarms in grids.

A comparison of the state-space and verification results with an\nabsolute (or global) and a relative encoding of the Alpha algorithm highlights\nthe advantages of our approach, allowing model checking larger grid sizes and\nnumber of robots, and consequently, verifying more complex emergent behaviours.\nFor example, a property was verified for a grid with 3 robots and a maximum\nallowed size of 8x8 cells in a global encoding, whereas this size was increased\nto 16x16 using a relative encoding. Also, the time to verify a property for a\nswarm of 3 robots in a 6x6 grid was reduced from almost 10 hours to only 7\nminutes.

We\nexplore some of the consequences for precision measurements of the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB). Quantum relaxation is a feature of the de\nBroglie-Bohm pilot-wave formulation of quantum theory, which allows the\nexistence of more general physical states that violate the Born probability\nrule. Recent work has shown that relaxation to the Born rule is suppressed for\nlong-wavelength field modes on expanding space, resulting in a large-scale\npower deficit with a characteristic inverse-tangent dependence on k. Because\nthe quantum relaxation dynamics is independent of the direction of the wave\nvector for the relaxing field mode, in the limit of weak anisotropy we are able\nto derive an expression for the anisotropic power spectrum that is determined\nby the power deficit function. As a result, the off-diagonal terms in the CMB\ncovariance matrix are also determined by the power deficit. We show that the\nlowest-order l-(l+1) inter-multipole correlations have a characteristic scaling\nwith multipole moment l. Our derived spectrum also predicts a residual\nstatistical anisotropy at small scales, with an approximate consistency\nrelation between the scaling of the l-(l+1) correlations and the scaling of the\nangular power spectrum at high l. We also predict a relationship between the\nl-(l+1) correlations at large and small scales. Cosmological quantum relaxation\nappears to provide a single physical mechanism that predicts both a large-scale\npower deficit and a range of statistical anisotropies, together with\npotentially testable relationships between them.\n","Comment: 42 pages, 4 figures"]}]

To test this idea we band pass filter the\n140 year long daily sunspot area data to obtain the 88 day period and 176 day\nsub harmonic period components of the data and compare the time variation of\nthe components with the time variation of the orbital radius of Mercury, or\nmore specifically with the time variation of the tidal effect of Mercury. We\nwere able to show that, when successive episodes of the occurrence of the 88\nday period component were discrete and not overlapping in time, the time\nvariation of this component of sunspot area was either exactly in-phase or\nexactly in anti-phase with the time variation of tidal effect. A similar result\nwas obtained for the 176 day period component. When several discrete episodes\nof the components occurred during a solar cycle the spectrum of the sunspot\narea data exhibited strong sidebands with periods dependent on the duration of\nthe episodes. A simple model based on episode modulation and solar cycle\nmodulation of 88 day and sub harmonic period sinusoids reproduced most of the\nspectral peaks observed in the intermediate range of sunspot area periodicity.\nThis is compelling evidence of a link between the motion of Mercury and the\nperiodic emergence of sunspots.

As this pseudoscalar may be lighter than the\ndiscovered Higgs boson without conflict with data, it may lead to LHC\nsignatures rather different to what is usually searched for in terms of new\nphysics. In these proceedings we will discuss studies concerning the\ndiscoverability of such light pseudoscalars. It is demonstrated that heavier\nscalars decaying to pairs of pseudoscalars or pseudoscalars and Z bosons may\nlead to discovery in a large part of the parameter space. This is especially\nimportant for the non-SM like of the two lightest scalars, as it may have an\nalmost 100% branching ratio for decay into pairs of pseudoscalars.

One of the main difficulties\nencountered is that the desired symmetries tend to be anomalous in the\nprevailing three generation constructions. The reason is that these models\nutilise the symmetry breaking pattern $E_6\\rightarrow SO(10)\\times U(1)_\\zeta$\nby GGSO projections. Consequently, $U(1)_\\zeta$ becomes anomalous. The\nspinor--vector duality that was observed in the fermionic $Z_2\\times Z_2$\norbifold compactifications is used to construct a phenomenological three\ngeneration Pati--Salam heterotic--string model in which $U(1)_\\zeta$ is anomaly\nfree and therefore can be a component of a low scale $Z^\\prime$. The model\nimplies existence of matter states at the $Z^\\prime$ breaking scale, which are\nrequired for anomaly cancelation. Moreover, the string model gives rise to\nexotic states, which are $SO(10)$ singlets but carry exotic $U(1)_\\zeta$\ncharges.

Existing inter-atomic-interaction potentials of Molecular Dynamics (MD)\nsimulations for studying this are unsuitable because they assume two-particle\ncollisions at a time instead of many (including contaminants)-particle\ncollisions (Wider-area Perturbations, (WP)). We designed this study to develop\na suitable potential that incorporates WP of the MD. We developed the general\npotential to account for the possibility of WP due to contaminants (both\nforeign and local to the material) consequently shifting the eqiulibrium points\nof the MD the material. For instance, dynamics of Au and Fe were studied with O\nbombardments/contamination (oxygenated environments), and those of CSiGe were\nstudied with W, Ti, and O. It was found that the phase-shift, of the\neqiulibrium points of the MD simulations, for Au stabilised for just five atoms\nof oxygen while that of Fe did not, when interacting in separate oxygenated\nenvironments. A different phase shift was recorded for CSiGe which reflected\nthe usage of different contaminants, under subsequent bombardments with W, Ti\nand O, in transformations to CSiGeW, CSiGeWTi, and CSiGeWTiO. These results and\nthose for the sampled superconducting materials, such as SrNdCuO and LiFeAs,\nshowed a sensitivity of the general potential, and insensitivity of the\nexisting potentials, to the type and environment of the atoms of these\nmaterials.
