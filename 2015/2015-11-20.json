The violation of the Bell-type inequalities was considered as\nproving this non-locality. However, these inequalities are constructed on a\nclass of local hidden variables, which obey the calculus with positive\nprobabilities. Such a calculus is rather suitable for billiard balls while the\nQM deals with wave-packets of complex amplitudes. There is no wonder that a\ncalculus with positive numbers does not match a calculus with complex numbers.\nThe present text describes a different model of hidden variables for\nentanglements, model that reproduces the quantum predictions in different\nexperiments, and also explains why the QM is nonlocal. The model deals with\nwaves, some of them full and the others empty, and the hidden variables mark\nwhich waves are full. The basic physical concept with which the model operates\nis joint amplitudes of probability, and not probabilities. The latter are a\nsecondary concept, the probability of a combination of results being equal to\nthe absolute square of sum of all the contributing joint amplitudes. Thus the\nnon-locality appears: a) a joint amplitude ignores distance, it handles distant\nparticles as if they were one single particle at one single place, b) joint\namplitudes are complex numbers and the sum of several contributions may vanish,\nblocking the respective combination of wave-packets and therefore of results.\nAlthough showing the success of the model, this text does not advocate for\nfull/empty waves. It is shown that this hypothesis works only as long as one\ndoes not consider moving observers, and does not compare their conclusions. The\nreal purpose here is to point to a severe impasse: assuming the existence of a\npreferred frame contradicts the theory of relativity, while refuting the\nfull/empty waves idea one runs into other insurmountable difficulties.\n","Comment: 11 pages"]}]

One of the most important\nissues for any MCMC method is the convergence of the Markov chain, which\ndepends crucially on a suitable choice of the proposal density. Adaptive\nRejection Metropolis Sampling (ARMS) is a well-known MH scheme that generates\nsamples from one-dimensional target densities making use of adaptive piecewise\nproposals constructed using support points taken from rejected samples. In this\nwork we pinpoint a crucial drawback in the adaptive procedure in ARMS: support\npoints might never be added inside regions where the proposal is below the\ntarget. When this happens in many regions it leads to a poor performance of\nARMS, with the proposal never converging to the target. In order to overcome\nthis limitation we propose two improved adaptive schemes for constructing the\nproposal. The first one is a direct modification of the ARMS procedure that\nincorporates support points inside regions where the proposal is below the\ntarget, while satisfying the diminishing adaptation property, one of the\nrequired conditions to assure the convergence of the Markov chain. The second\none is an adaptive independent MH algorithm with the ability to learn from all\nprevious samples except for the current state of the chain, thus also\nguaranteeing the convergence to the invariant density. These two new schemes\nimprove the adaptive strategy of ARMS, thus simplifying the complexity in the\nconstruction of the proposals.

Lower bounds are derived for the reconstruction error of a single\nnormally or uniformly-distributed finite-dimensional vector imperfectly\nmeasured by a network of sensors and transmitted with finite energy to a common\nreceiver via an additive white Gaussian noise asynchronous multiple-access\nchannel. Transmission makes use of a perfect causal feedback link to the\nencoder connected to each sensor. A retransmission protocol inspired by the\nclassical scheme in [1] applied to the transmission of single and bi-variate\nanalog samples analyzed in [2] and [3] is extended to the more general network\nscenario, for which asymptotic upper-bounds on the reconstruction error are\nprovided. Both the upper and lower-bounds show that collaboration can be\nachieved through energy accumulation under certain circumstances. In order to\ninvestigate the practical performance of the proposed retransmission protocol\nwe provide a numerical evaluation of the upper-bounds in the non-asymptotic\nenergy regime using low-order quantization in the sensors. The latter includes\na minor modification of the protocol to improve reconstruction fidelity.\nNumerical results show that an increase in the size of the network brings\nbenefit in terms of performance, but that the gain in terms of energy\nefficiency diminishes quickly at finite energies due to a non-coherent\ncombining loss.\n","Comment: This paper was presented [in part] at ISIT 2013, IEEE International\n  Symposium on Information Theory, July 7-12, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]}]

In the second\npart of this work, a transoceanic fiber system with 6000 km of standard\nsingle-mode fiber is simulated and its MI determined. Among rectangular QAMs,\n16-QAM is found to be the optimal modulation scheme for this link as to\nperformance in terms of MI and requirements on components and digital signal\nprocessing. For the reported MI of 3.1 bits/symbol, a minimum coding overhead\nof 29% is required when the channel memory is not taken into account. By\nemploying ideal single-channel digital back-propagation, an increase in MI by\n0.25 bits/symbol and 0.28 bits/symbol is reported for 16-QAM and 64-QAM,\nrespectively, lowering the required overhead to 19% and 16%. When the channel\nspacing is decreased to be close to the Nyquist rate, the dual-polarization\nspectral efficiency is 5.7 bits/s/Hz, an increase of more than 2 bits/symbol\ncompared to a 50 GHz spacing.\n","Comment: Minor changes were made in comparison to the previous version, An\n  extended version of this paper (with MI lower bounds instead of MI estimates)\n  is available, see http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01495"]}]

These\nadditional second laws also hold for quantum systems, and are, in fact, often\nmore relevant in this regime. They place a restriction on how the probabilities\nof energy levels can evolve. Here, we consider additional restrictions on how\nthe coherences between energy levels can evolve.

We show that every CP instrument on\nan atomic von Neumann algebra has the NEP, extending the well-known result for\ntype I factors. Moreover, we show that every CP instrument on an injective von\nNeumann algebra is approximated by CP instruments with the NEP. The concept of\nposterior states is also discussed to show that the NEP is equivalent to the\nexistence of a strongly measurable family of posterior states for every normal\nstate. Two examples of CP instruments without the NEP are obtained from this\nresult. It is thus concluded that in local quantum physics not every CP\ninstrument represents a measuring process, but in most of physically relevant\ncases every CP instrument can be realized by a measuring process within\narbitrary error limits, as every approximately finite dimensional (AFD) von\nNeumann algebra on a separable Hilbert space is injective.

In this article, we show that the membrane curvature prior to wrapping\nplays a key role for the wrapping process, besides the size and shape of the\nnanoparticles that have been investigated in recent years. For membrane\nsegments that initially bulge away from nanoparticles by having a mean\ncurvature of the same sign as the mean curvature of the particle surface, we\nfind strongly stable partially wrapped states that can prevent full wrapping.\nFor membrane segments that initially bulge towards the nanoparticles, in\ncontrast, partially wrapped states can constitute a significant energetic\nbarrier for the wrapping process.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures; to appear in 'Soft Matter'"]}]

A celebrated\nresult of Backurs and Indyk (STOC'15) proves that the Edit Distance of two\nsequences of length n cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time under\nSETH. The result was extended by follow-up works to simpler looking problems\nlike finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).\n  SETH is a very strong assumption, asserting that even linear size CNF\nformulas cannot be analyzed for satisfiability with an exponential speedup over\nexhaustive search. We consider much safer assumptions, e.g. that such a speedup\nis impossible for SAT on much more expressive representations, like NC\ncircuits.
