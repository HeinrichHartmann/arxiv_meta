A systematic procedure for deriving an equation\nfor surface elevation for a prescribed relation between the orders of the two\nexpansion parameters, the amplitude parameter $\\alpha$ and the long wavelength\n(or shallowness) parameter $\\beta$, is developed. Unlike the heuristic\napproaches found in the literature, when modifications are made in the equation\nfor surface elevation itself, the procedure starts from the consistently\ntruncated asymptotic expansions for unidirectional waves, a counterpart of the\nBoussinesq system of equations for the surface elevation and the bottom\nvelocity, from which the leading order and higher order equations for the\nsurface elevation can be obtained by iterations. The relations between the\norders of the two small parameters are taken in the form $\\beta=O(\\alpha^n)$\nand $\\alpha=O(\\beta^m)$ with $n$ and $m$ specified to some important particular\ncases. The analysis shows, in particular, that some evolution equations,\nproposed before as model equations in other physical contexts (like the Gardner\nequation, the modified KdV equation, and the so-called 5th-order KdV equation),\ncan emerge as the leading order equations in the asymptotic expansion for the\nunidirectional water waves, on equal footing with the KdV equation. The results\nrelated to the higher orders of approximation provide a set of consistent\nhigher order model equations for unidirectional water waves which replace the\nKdV equation with higher-order corrections in the case of non-standard ordering\nwhen the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are not of the same order of\nmagnitude.

Recent discoveries, enabled by sophisticated\nfabrication, have uncovered new phenomena that completely change our\nunderstanding of transport in these devices, especially the role of the spin\nand valley degrees of freedom. This review describes the modern understanding\nof transport through nanotube devices.\n  Unlike conventional semiconductors, electrons in nanotubes have two angular\nmomentum quantum numbers, arising from spin and from valley freedom. We focus\non the interplay between the two. In single quantum dots defined in short\nlengths of nanotube, the energy levels associated with each degree of freedom,\nand the spin-orbit coupling between them, are revealed by Coulomb blockade\nspectroscopy. In double quantum dots, the combination of quantum numbers\nmodifies the selection rules of Pauli blockade. This can be exploited to read\nout spin and valley qubits, and to measure the decay of these states through\ncoupling to nuclear spins and phonons. A second unique property of carbon\nnanotubes is that the combination of valley freedom and electron-electron\ninteractions in one dimension strongly modifies their transport behaviour.\nInteraction between electrons inside and outside a quantum dot is manifested in\nSU(4) Kondo behavior and level renormalization. Interaction within a dot leads\nto Wigner molecules and more complex correlated states.\n  This review takes an experimental perspective informed by recent advances in\ntheory. As well as the well-understood overall picture, we also state clearly\nopen questions for the field.

Using a geometrical\nmodel that accounts for the entropy of the soft modes and the diffusion rates\nalong them, we accurately reproduce the measured rearrangement rates.

Through the noncommutative deformation parameterized by a\nSeiberg-Witten transform on the original canonical variables, one gets the\nstandard commutation relations for the new ones, such that the obtained\nHamiltonian represents then two \\emph{interacting} 1D HO's. By assuming that\none HO is inverted relatively to the other, we show that their effective\ninteraction induces a squeezing dynamics for initial coherent states imaged in\nthe phase space. A suitable pattern of logarithmic spirals is obtained and some\nrelevant properties are discussed in terms of Wigner functions, which are\nessential to put in evidence the effects of the noncommutativity.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 2 figures, as an Invited Comment for Physica Scripta"]}]

A Roman dominating function for a graph\n$G=(V,E)$, is a function $f:V\\rightarrow \\{0,1,2\\}$ such that every vertex $v$\nwith $f(v)=0$ has at least a neighbor $w$ in $G$ for which $f(w)=2$. The Roman\ndomination number of a graph is the minimum weight, $\\sum_{v\\in V}f(v)$, of a\nRoman dominating function.\n  In this paper we initiate the study of a new parameter related to Roman\ndomination, which we call strong Roman domination number and denote it by\n$\\gamma_{StR}(G)$.

Sound-Proof does not require interaction between the\nuser and his phone. In Sound-Proof the second authentication factor is the\nproximity of the user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity\nof the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their\nmicrophones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so\nthat the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication.\nSound-Proof can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major\nbrowsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We\nprovide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to\ndetermine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if\nthe phone is in a pocket or purse. We conduct a user study designed to compare\nthe perceived usability of Sound-Proof with Google 2-Step Verification.\nParticipants ranked Sound-Proof as more usable and the majority would be\nwilling to use Sound-Proof even for scenarios in which two-factor\nauthentication is optional.\n","Comment: 16 pages"]}]

To describe a\ngeneral scenario, we allow for both Rashba and Dresselhaus type spin-orbit\ncoupling. Our results are obtained via the quasiclassical theory of\nsuperconductivity, extended to include spin-orbit coupling in the Usadel\nequation and Kupriyanov--Lukichev boundary conditions. Unlike previous works,\nwe have derived a Riccati parametrization of the Usadel equation with\nspin-orbit coupling which allows us to address the full proximity regime.\nFirst, we consider the density of states in both SF bilayers and SFS trilayers,\nwhere the spectroscopic features in the latter case are sensitive to the phase\ndifference between the two superconductors. We find that the presence of\nspin-orbit coupling leaves clear spectroscopic fingerprints in the density of\nstates due to its role in creating spin-triplet Cooper pairs. Unlike SF and SFS\nstructures without spin-orbit coupling, the density of states in the present\ncase depends strongly on the direction of magnetization. We show that the\nspin-orbit coupling can stabilize singlet superconductivity even in the\npresence of a strong exchange field $h \\gg \\Delta$.

The\nrefinement is carried out by inserting additional Steiner vertices inside the\ncircumsphere of a poor-quality tetrahedron (to remove the tetrahedron) at a\nsufficient distance from existing vertices to guarantee the termination and\nsize optimality of the algorithm. This technique eliminates tetrahedra whose\nratio of the radius of the circumscribing sphere and the shortest side, the\nradius-edge ratio, is large. Slivers, almost-planar tetrahedra, which have a\nsmall radius-edge ratio, but a large aspect ratio, are avoided by small random\nperturbations of the Steiner vertices to improve the aspect ratio.\nAdditionally, geometric constraints, called \"petals\", have been shown to\nproduce smaller high-quality meshes in 2D Delaunay refinement algorithms.

The\nfeasibility of their dense deployments depends on the existence of a high\ndata-rate transport network that can provide high-data backhaul from an\naggregation node where data traffic originates and terminates, to every such\nsmall cell. Due to the limited range of radio signals in the high frequency\nbands, multihop wireless connection may need to be established between each\naccess node and an aggregation node. In this paper, we present a novel\ntransmission scheme for wireless multihop backhaul for 5G networks. The scheme\nconsists of 1) {\\em group successive relaying} that established a relay\nschedule to efficiently exploit half-duplex relays and 2) an optimized\nquantize-map-and-forward (QMF) coding scheme that improves the performance of\nQMF and reduces the decoding complexity and the delay. We derive an achievable\nrate region of the proposed scheme and attain a closed-form expression in the\nasymptotic case for several network models of interests. It is shown that the\nproposed scheme provides a significant gain over multihop routing (based on\ndecode-and-forward), which is a solution currently proposed for wireless\nmultihop backhaul network. Furthermore, the performance gap increases as a\nnetwork becomes denser. For the proposed scheme, we then develop\nenergy-efficient routing that determines {\\em groups} of participating relays\nfor every hop. To reflect the metric used in the routing algorithm, we refer to\nit as {\\em interference-harnessing} routing. By turning interference into a\nuseful signal, each relay requires a lower transmission power to achieve a\ndesired performance compared to other routing schemes. Finally, we present a\nlow-complexity successive decoder, which makes it feasible to use the proposed\nscheme in practice.\n","Comment: Parts of this paper will be presented at GLOBECOM 2015. arXiv admin\n  note: text overlap with arXiv:1003.5966 by other authors"]}]

Two\npartial-order broadcast conditions interference-oblivious less noisy and\ninterference-cognizant less noisy are defined, thereby extending the usual less\nnoisy condition for a regular broadcast channel by taking interference into\naccount. Under these conditions, a reduced form of R is shown to be equivalent\nto a rate region based on a simpler scheme, where the broadcast transmitter\nuses only superposition. Furthermore, if interference is strong for the\ninterference-oblivious less noisy DM-BIC, the capacity region is given by the\naforementioned two equivalent rate regions. For a Gaussian broadcast\ninterference channel (GBIC), channel parameters are categorized into three\nregimes. For the first two regimes, which are closely related to the two\npartial-order broadcast conditions, achievable rate regions are derived by\nspecializing the corresponding achievable schemes of DM-BICs with Gaussian\ninput distributions. The entropy power inequality (EPI) based outer bounds are\nobtained by combining bounding techniques for a Gaussian broadcast channel\n(GBC) and a Gaussian interference channel (GIC). These inner and outer bounds\nlead to either exact or approximate characterizations of capacity regions and\nsum capacity under various conditions. For the remaining complementing regime,\ninner and outer bounds are also provided.\n"]}]

The addition of small amounts\nof Rh and Mn provides an improvement in the thermal stability with some\ndegradation of the magnetic properties. The small amounts of Rh and Mn\nadditions in MnBi stabilize an orthorhombic phase whose structural and magnetic\nproperties are closely related to the ones of the previously reported\nhigh-temperature phase of MnBi (HT~MnBi). To date, the properties of the\nHT~MnBi, which is stable between $613$ and $719$~K, have not been studied in\ndetail because of its transformation to the stable low-temperature MnBi\n(LT~MnBi), making measurements near and below its Curie temperature difficult.\nThe Rh-stabilized MnBi with chemical formula Mn$_{1.0625-x}$Rh$_{x}$Bi\n[$x=0.02(1)$] adopts a new superstructure of the NiAs/Ni$_2$In structure\nfamily. It is ferromagnetic below a Curie temperature of $416$~K.

Some of the third order elastic constants have also been\nevaluated. The absolute magnitudes of the calculated values for bcc iron are in\nfair agreement with experiment, including the third order constants, although\nthe computed elastic anisotropy is much weaker than measured. The tetragonally\ndistorted dilute FeC and FeN alloys exhibit lower stiffness than bcc iron,\nparticularly in the tensor component C33, while the elastic anisotropy is\nvirtually the same. Average values of elastic moduli for polycrystalline\naggregates are also computed.
