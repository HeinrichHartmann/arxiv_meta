Results: We characterize genome-wide DNA methylation patterns,\nand show that correlation among CpG sites decays rapidly, making predictions\nsolely based on neighboring sites challenging. We built a random forest\nclassifier to predict CpG site methylation levels using as features neighboring\nCpG site methylation levels and genomic distance, and co-localization with\ncoding regions, CGIs, and regulatory elements from the ENCODE project, among\nothers.

The subsystems are coupled via their scalar quantity (e.g., trade\ncouples economic output; diffusion couples populations); that coupling moves\nthe locations of their bifurcations. The model demonstrates two ways in which\nsudden changes can propagate: they can cascade (one causing the next), or they\ncan hop over subsystems.

However, the tribopolymer which forms due\nto the mechanical load to the surface contacts affects the conductivity between\nthe contacts dramatically.

We demonstrate that the formation of tribopolymer is induced\nboth by the mechanical load and by the catalytic effect of the contact. First,\nbenzene molecules are adsorbed on the Pt surfaces. Then, due to the closure of\nthe Pt contacts, stress is applied to the adsorbates, making the C-H bonds more\nfragile. As the stress increases further, H atoms are pressed close to the Pt\nsubstrate and begin to bond with Pt atoms. Thus Pt acts as a catalyst,\naccelerating the dehydrogenation process. When there is voltage applied across\nthe contacts, the catalytic effect is enhanced by electrochemistry. Finally,\ndue to the loss of H atoms, C atoms become more reactive and link together or\npile up to form tribopolymer.

This paper\nconsiders non-generic subgroups of simple algebraic groups of exceptional type\nin arbitrary characteristic.\n  A finite subgroup is called Lie primitive if it lies in no proper subgroup of\npositive dimension. We prove here that many non-generic subgroup types,\nincluding the alternating and symmetric groups $\\text{Alt}_{n}$,\n$\\text{Sym}_{n}$ for $n \\ge 10$, do not occur as Lie primitive subgroups of an\nexceptional algebraic group.\n  A subgroup of $G$ is called $G$-completely reducible if, whenever it lies in\na parabolic subgroup of $G$, it lies in a conjugate of the corresponding Levi\nfactor. Here, we derive a fairly short list of possible isomorphism types of\nnon-$G$-completely reducible, non-generic simple subgroups.\n  As an intermediate result, for each simply connected $G$ of exceptional type,\nand each non-generic finite simple group $H$ which embeds into $G/Z(G)$, we\nderive a set of feasible characters, which restrict the possible composition\nfactors of $V \\downarrow S$, whenever $S$ is a subgroup of $G$ with image $H$\nin $G/Z(G)$, and $V$ is either the Lie algebra of $G$ or a non-trivial Weyl\nmodule for $G$ of least dimension.\n  This has implications for the subgroup structure of the finite groups of\nexceptional Lie type. For instance, we show that for $n \\ge 10$, $\\text{Alt}_n$\nand $\\text{Sym}_n$, as well as numerous other almost simple groups, cannot\noccur as a maximal subgroup of an almost simple group whose socle is a finite\nsimple group of exceptional Lie type.\n","Comment: 158 pages; accepted for publication in Memoirs of the AMS"]}]

We study numerically the\nbirth of a sonic black hole in an outcoupled Bose-Einstein condensate after\nrelaxing the confinement provided by an optical lattice. We also study possible\nsignatures of spontaneous Hawking radiation. We propose that the violation of\nCS inequalities is a smoking gun of the presence of the Hawking effect. We\ncompare this criterion with the presence of entaglement, finding that both are\nequivalent under usual assumptions. Finally, we study a different gravitational\nanalogue: the so-called black-hole laser. The most interesting result is the\nappearance of a regime of continuous and periodic emission of solitons,\nproviding the most strong analogue with optical lasers. In the second part, we\nanalyze the effect of the introduction of a short Bragg pulse in a thermal\ncloud. We show that the induced periodic density pattern decays to the\nequilibrium profile. However, instead of the usual collisional relaxation, the\nmechanism responsible for the decay is the thermal disorder of the particles,\nwith a characteristic time that only depends on the temperature.

We apply the new method to video captioning where temporal\ninformation plays a crucial role. Experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art on video captioning benchmarks.

However, recent studies showed that these devices are\nfar from being secure. Moreover, many embedded systems rely on web interfaces\nfor user interaction or administration. Unfortunately, web security is known to\nbe difficult, and therefore the web interfaces of embedded systems represent a\nconsiderable attack surface.\n  In this paper, we present the first fully automated framework that applies\ndynamic firmware analysis techniques to achieve, in a scalable manner,\nautomated vulnerability discovery within embedded firmware images. We apply our\nframework to study the security of embedded web interfaces running in\nCommercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) embedded devices, such as routers, DSL/cable\nmodems, VoIP phones, IP/CCTV cameras. We introduce a methodology and implement\na scalable framework for discovery of vulnerabilities in embedded web\ninterfaces regardless of the vendor, device, or architecture. To achieve this\ngoal, our framework performs full system emulation to achieve the execution of\nfirmware images in a software-only environment, i.e., without involving any\nphysical embedded devices. Then, we analyze the web interfaces within the\nfirmware using both static and dynamic tools. We also present some interesting\ncase-studies, and discuss the main challenges associated with the dynamic\nanalysis of firmware images and their web interfaces and network services. The\nobservations we make in this paper shed light on an important aspect of\nembedded devices which was not previously studied at a large scale.\n  We validate our framework by testing it on 1925 firmware images from 54\ndifferent vendors. We discover important vulnerabilities in 185 firmware\nimages, affecting nearly a quarter of vendors in our dataset. These\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n"]}]

We present a sharp\ninterface approach which treats the interface as a shock-wave like\ndiscontinuity. Any mixing of fluid phases is avoided by using the flow solver\nin the bulk regions only, and a ghost-fluid approach close to the interface.\nThe coupling states for the numerical solution in the bulk regions are\ndetermined by the solution of local multi-phase Riemann problems across the\ninterface. The Riemann solution accounts for the relevant physics by enforcing\nappropriate jump conditions at the phase boundary. A wide variety of interface\neffects can be handled in a thermodynamically consistent way. This includes\nsurface tension or mass/energy transfer by phase transition. Moreover, the\nlocal normal speed of the interface, which is needed to calculate the time\nevolution of the interface, is given by the Riemann solution. The interface\ntracking itself is based on a level-set method.\n  The focus in this paper is the description of the multi-phase Riemann solver\nand its usage within the sharp interface approach.

In the case of many group IV-VI,\nV, and related materials, these interactions are strong and the materials exist\nnear electronic and structural phase transitions. Their close proximity to\nphase instability produces a fragile balance among the various properties. The\nprototypical example is PbTe whose incipient ferroelectric behaviour has been\nassociated with large phonon anharmonicity and thermoelectricity. Experimental\nmeasurements on PbTe reveal anomalous lattice dynamics, especially in the soft\ntransverse optical phonon branch. This has been interpreted in terms of both\ngiant anharmonicity and local symmetry breaking due to off-centering of the Pb\nions. The observed anomalies have prompted renewed theoretical and\ncomputational interest, which has in turn revived focus on the extent that\nelectron-phonon interactions drive lattice instabilities in PbTe and related\nmaterials. Here, we use Fourier-transform inelastic x-ray scattering (FT-IXS)\nto show that photo-injection of free carriers stabilizes the paraelectric\nstate. With support from constrained density functional theory (CDFT)\ncalculations, we find that photoexcitation weakens the long-range forces along\nthe cubic direction tied to resonant bonding and incipient ferroelectricity.\nThis demonstrates the importance of electronic states near the band edges in\ndetermining the equilibrium structure.\n","Comment: 9 page, 3 figures"]}]
