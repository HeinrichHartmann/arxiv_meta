We use the ferromagnetic Ising model with the high-resolution\nmultiple histogram Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. We show that though the 2D\nbehavior remains dominant at small thicknesses, there is a systematic\ncontinuous deviation of the critical exponents from their 2D values. We observe\nthat in the same range of varying thickness the deviation of the exponent $\\nu$\nis very small from its 2D value, while exponent $\\beta$ suffers a larger\ndeviation. Moreover, as long as the film thickness is fixed, i. e. no finite\nsize scaling is done in the $z$ direction perpendicular to the film, the 3D\nvalues of the critical exponents cannot be attained even with very large (but\nfixed) thickness. The crossover to 3D universality class cannot therefore take\nplace without finite size scaling applied in the $z$ direction, in the limit of\nnumerically accessible thicknesses. From values of exponent $\\alpha$ obtained\nby MC, we estimate the effective dimension of the system.

The statistical physics of this process\nhas a long history, and is commonly described in term of the Poland-Scheraga\n(PS) model. Crucial to this model is the configurational entropy for a melted\nregion (compared to the entropy of an intact region of the same size),\nquantified by the loop factor. In this study we investigate how confinement\naffects the DNA melting transition, by using the loop factor for an ideal\nGaussian chain. By subsequent numerical solutions of the PS model, we\ndemonstrate that the melting temperature depends on the persistence lengths of\nsingle-stranded and double-stranded DNA. For realistic values of the\npersistence lengths the melting temperature is predicted to decrease with\ndecreasing channel diameter. We also demonstrate that confinement broadens the\nmelting transition. These general findings hold for the three scenarios\ninvestigated: namely 1. homo-DNA, i.e. identical basepairs along the DNA\nmolecule; 2. random sequence DNA, and 3. \"real\" DNA, here T4 phage DNA. We show\nthat cases 2 and 3 in general give rise to broader transitions than case 1.\nCase 3 exhibits a similar phase transition as case 2 provided the random\nsequence DNA has the same ratio of AT to GC basepairs.

Fostered by the relevancy of a scientific\ncharacterization of cities and for the availability of an unprecedented amount\nof data, academics have recently immersed in this topic and one of the most\nstriking and universal finding was the discovery of robust allometric scaling\nlaws between several urban indicators and the population size.

We\nshow that this scale-adjusted metric provides a more appropriate/informative\nsummary of the evolution of urban indicators and reveals patterns that do not\nappear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from\nBrazilian cities. We also show that these scale-adjusted metrics are strongly\ncorrelated with their past values by a linear correspondence and that they also\ndisplay crosscorrelations among themselves.

The model comprises an associative and unsupervised learning\nstrategy for the neural circuit of the ant. The neural circuit adapts to the\nenvironment by means of classical conditioning. The initially unknown\nenvironment includes different types of stimuli representing food and obstacles\nwhich, when they come in direct contact with the ant, elicit a reflex response\nin the motor neural system of the ant: moving towards or away from the source\nof the stimulus.

While there\nare modern methods designed to deal with high-dimensional data, they may not\nfully use the covariance information as LDA does. Hence in some situations, it\nis still desirable to use a model-based method such as LDA for classification.\nThis article exploits the potential of LDA in more complicated data settings.\nIn many real applications, it is costly to manually place labels on\nobservations; hence it is often that only a small portion of labeled data is\navailable while a large number of observations are left without a label.

Given a new robot image, we perform\ninverse kinematics visually by interpolating between nearby images in the image\nspace. Obstacles are projected onto the VRM in $O(n)$ time by superimposition\nof images, leading to the identification of collision poses. The edges joining\nthe free nodes can now be checked with a visual local planner, and free-space\nmotions computed in $O(nlogn)$ time. This enables us to plan paths in the image\nspace for a robot manipulator with unknown link geometries, DOF, kinematics,\nobstacles, and camera pose. We sketch the proofs for the main theoretical\nideas, identify the assumptions, and demonstrate the approach for both\narticulated and mobile robots.

Observations of many active regions show a slow systematic\noutflow/upflow from their edges lasting from hours to days. At present no\nphysical explanation has been proven, while several suggestions have been put\nforward. Aims. This paper investigates one possible method for maintaining\nthese upflows assuming that convective motions drive the magnetic field to\ninitiate them through magnetic reconnection. Methods. We use Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI) data to provide an initial potential three dimensional\nmagnetic field of the active region NOAA 11123 on 2010 November 13 where the\ncharacteristic upflow velocities are observed. A simple one-dimensional\nhydrostatic atmospheric model covering the region from the photosphere to the\ncorona is derived. Local Correlation Tracking of the magnetic features in the\nHMI data is used to derive a proxy for the time dependent velocity field. The\ntime dependent evolution of the system is solved using a resistive\nthree-dimensional MagnetoHydro-Dynamic code. Results. The magnetic field\ncontains several null points located well above the photosphere, with their fan\nplanes dividing the magnetic field into independent open and closed flux\ndomains. The stressing of the interfaces between the different flux domains is\nexpected to provide locations where magnetic reconnection can take place and\ndrive systematic flows. In this case, the region between the closed and open\nflux is identified as the region where observations find the systematic\nupflows. Conclusions. In the present experiment, the driving only initiates\nmagneto-acoustic waves, without driving any systematic upflows at any of the\nflux interfaces.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ.

For $MH_*(Y;R)$ the chain complex\n$(MC_*(Y;R),\\partial)$ is generated by quadruples $[V,n,s,t]$ satisfying\nrelations, where $V$ is an oriented manifold with corners, $n\\in\\mathbb N$, and\n$s:V\\to{\\mathbb R}^n$, $t:V\\to Y$ are smooth with $s$ proper near 0 in\n${\\mathbb R}^n$.\n  We show that $MH_*(Y;R),MH^*(Y;R)$ satisfy the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, and\nso are canonically isomorphic to conventional (co)homology. The usual\noperations on (co)homology -- pushforwards $f_*$, pullbacks $f^*$, fundamental\nclasses $[Y]$ for compact oriented $Y$, cup, cap and cross products\n$\\cup,\\cap,\\times$ -- are all defined and well-behaved at the (co)chain level.\nChains $MC_*(Y;R)$ form flabby cosheaves on $Y$, and cochains $MC^*(Y;R)$ form\nsoft sheaves on $Y$, so they have good gluing properties.\n  We also define $compactly$-$supported$ $M$-$cohomology$ $MH^*_{cs}(Y;R)$,\n$locally$ $finite$ $M$-$homology$ $MH_*^{lf}(Y;R)$ (a kind of Borel-Moore\nhomology), and two variations on the entire theory, $rational$\n$M$-($co$)$homology$ and $de$ $Rham$ $M$-($co$)$homology$. All of these are\ncanonically isomorphic to the corresponding type of conventional (co)homology.\n  The reason for doing this is that our M-(co)homology theories are very well\nbehaved at the (co)chain level, and will be better than other (co)homology\ntheories for some purposes, particularly in problems involving transversality.\nIn a sequel we will construct virtual classes and virtual chains for Kuranishi\nspaces in M-(co)homology, with a view to applications of M-(co)homology in\nareas of Symplectic Geometry involving moduli spaces of $J$-holomorphic curves.\n","Comment: 232 pages, LaTeX"]}]
