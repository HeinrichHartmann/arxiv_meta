We finally discuss the\ndifference between the baryon number and the proton number fluctuations from\ncorrelation effects in isospin space. The numerical results suggest that such\neffects are only minor even in the case of complete randomization of isospin.\n","Comment: 9 pages; 7 figures; updated to a published version; uncertainty\n  estimates added on the plots"]}]

The only access to these\nfunctions is through stochastic gradient oracles, each of which is only\navailable at a different node, and a limited number of gradient oracle calls is\nallowed at each node. In this framework, we introduce a convex optimization\nalgorithm based on the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates.

This rate of convergence is optimal as it\nmatches the performance lower bound up to constant terms. Similar to the SGD\nalgorithm, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm also scales\nlinearly with the dimensionality of the data. Furthermore, the communication\nload of the proposed method is the same as the communication load of the SGD\nalgorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm is highly efficient in terms of\ncomplexity and communication load.

A popular strategy for defending against all\nclasses of these attacks is to modify the implementation so that the timing and\ncache access patterns of every hardware instruction is independent of the\nsecret inputs.

This\nreward is then used by the learner to improve its future decisions. However, in\nnumerous applications, ranging from personalized patient treatment to\npersonalized web-based education, the learner does not obtain rewards after\neach action, but only after sequences of actions are taken, intermediate\nfeedbacks are observed, and a final decision is made based on which a reward is\nobtained. In this paper, we introduce a new class of reinforcement learning\nmethods which can operate in such settings. We refer to this class as staged\nmulti-armed bandits (S-MAB). S-MAB proceeds in rounds, each composed of several\nstages; in each stage, the learner chooses an action and observes a feedback\nsignal. Upon each action selection a feedback signal is observed, whilst the\nreward of the selected sequence of actions is only revealed after the learner\nselects a stop action that ends the current round. The reward of the round\ndepends both on the sequence of actions and the sequence of observed feedbacks.\nThe goal of the learner is to maximize its total expected reward over all\nrounds by learning to choose the best sequence of actions based on the feedback\nit gets about these actions. First, we define an oracle benchmark, which\nsequentially selects the actions that maximize the expected immediate reward.\nThis benchmark is known to be approximately optimal when the reward sequence\nassociated with the selected actions is adaptive submodular. Then, we propose\nour online learning algorithm, for which we prove that the regret is\nlogarithmic in the number of rounds and linear in the number of stages with\nrespect to the oracle benchmark.\n"]}]

The (unknown) utility of the\ndecision maker (DM) is modelled as a weighted combination of features. CLEO\niteratively alternates a preference elicitation step, where pairs of candidate\nsolutions are selected based on the current utility model, and a refinement\nstep where the utility is refined by incorporating the feedback received. The\nelicitation step leverages a Max-SMT solver to return optimal hybrid solutions\naccording to the current utility model.

Detailed radiative transfer models show that the observed equinox\ntemperatures of Saturn's A ring are much higher than model predictions as long\nas only the flux from Saturn is taken into account.

We develop a simple\nseasonal model for ring temperatures and first assume that the internal density\nand the thermal inertia of a ring particle are uniform with depth. The particle\nsize is estimated to be 1-2 m. The seasonal thermal inertia is found to be\n30-50 Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ in the middle A ring whereas it is $\\sim$ 10\nJm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ or as low as the diurnal thermal inertia in the\ninner and outermost regions of the A ring. An additional internal structure\nmodel, in which a particle has a high density core surrounded by a fluffy\nregolith mantle, shows that the core radius relative to the particle radius is\nabout 0.9 for the middle A ring and is much less for the inner and outer\nregions of the A ring. This means that the radial variation of the internal\ndensity of ring particles exists across the A ring. Some mechanisms may be\nconfining dense particles in the middle A ring against viscous diffusion.\nAlternatively, the (middle) A ring might have recently formed ($<$ 10$^{8}$ yr)\nby destruction of an icy satellite, so that dense particles have not yet\ndiffused over the A ring and regolith mantles of particles have not grown\nthick.

To\ndisentangle and quantify the contributions of electrons and protons to the\ngamma-ray flux, it is necessary to measure precisely the spectra and morphology\nof SNRs over a broad range of gamma-ray energies.

In\nlinear settings, temporally growing perturbations in a non-parallel flow\nrepresent unstable eigenmodes of the linear flow operator. In nonlinear\nsettings, self-sustained periodic oscillations of finite amplitude are commonly\ndescribed as nonlinear global modes.

This paper introduces the\nendogeneity concept, a specific definition of the sensitivity of the global\nfrequency and growth rate with respect to variations of the flow operator. The\nendogeneity, defined both in linear and nonlinear settings, characterizes the\ncontribution of localized flow regions to the global eigendynamics.

The results are shown to be consistent with earlier 'wavemaker'\ndefinitions found in the literature, but the present formalism enables a more\ndetailed discussion: a clear distinction is made between oscillation frequency\nand growth rate, and individual contributions from the various terms of the\nflow operator can be isolated and separately discussed.

In ROOT the TTree object\ncontainer is optimized for statistical data analysis over very large data sets\nby using vertical data storage techniques. These containers can span a large\nnumber of files on local disks, the web, or a number of different shared file\nsystems. In order to analyze this data, the user can chose out of a wide set of\nmathematical and statistical functions, including linear algebra classes,\nnumerical algorithms such as integration and minimization, and various methods\nfor performing regression analysis (fitting). In particular, ROOT offers\npackages for complex data modeling and fitting, as well as multivariate\nclassification based on machine learning techniques. A central piece in these\nanalysis tools are the histogram classes which provide binning of one- and\nmulti-dimensional data. Results can be saved in high-quality graphical formats\nlike Postscript and PDF or in bitmap formats like JPG or GIF. The result can\nalso be stored into ROOT macros that allow a full recreation and rework of the\ngraphics. Users typically create their analysis macros step by step, making use\nof the interactive C++ interpreter CINT, while running over small data samples.\nOnce the development is finished, they can run these macros at full compiled\nspeed over large data sets, using on-the-fly compilation, or by creating a\nstand-alone batch program. Finally, if processing farms are available, the user\ncan reduce the execution time of intrinsically parallel tasks - e.g. data\nmining in HEP - by using PROOF, which will take care of optimally distributing\nthe work over the available resources in a transparent way.\n"]}]

Additionally, the substitutional disorder of the\nicosahedral carbon at all six polar sites, as previously discussed in the\nliterature, is also considered. Two configurational phase transitions from the\nordered to the disordered configurations are predicted to take place upon\nincreasing temperature using a mean-field approximation for the entropy. The\nfirst transition, at 870 K, induces substitutional disorder of the icosahedral\ncarbon atoms among the three polar-up sites, meanwhile the second transition,\nat 2325 K, reveals the random substitution of the icosahedral carbon atoms at\nall six polar sites coexisting with bipolar defects. Already the first\ntransition removes the monoclinic distortion existing in the ordered ground\nstate configuration and restore the rhombohedral system (R3m). The restoration\nof inversion symmetry yielding the full rhombohedral symmetry (R-3m) on\naverage, corresponding to what is reported in the literature, is achieved after\nthe second transition.
