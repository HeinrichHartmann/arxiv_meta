In\nprinciple, this allows for precise identification of the occupied subbands from\nthe magnetoconductance patterns of quasi-ballistic devices.

These advanced\niterative methods feature fast convergence at the expense of a higher\ncomputational cost per iteration, causing them to be generally uncompetitive\nwithout the inclusion of a suitable preconditioner. Combining elements from\nstandard multigrid (MG) solvers and the theory of wavelets, a novel\nwavelet-based multi-level (WMG) preconditioner is introduced, which is shown to\nsignificantly speed-up Krylov convergence. The performance of the\nWMG-preconditioned Krylov method is analyzed through a spectral analysis, and\nthe approach is compared to existing methods like the classical Simultaneous\nIterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) and unpreconditioned Krylov methods\non a 2D tomographic benchmark problem. Numerical experiments are promising,\nshowing the method to be competitive with the classical Algebraic\nReconstruction Techniques in terms of convergence speed and overall performance\n(CPU time) as well as precision of the reconstruction.\n","Comment: Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics (2014), 26 pages, 13\n  figures, 3 tables"]}]

Therefore, universal adiabatic quantum computation requires a\nmethod for approximating quantum many-body Hamiltonians up to arbitrary\nspectral error using at most 2-body interactions.

Although the applications of Hamiltonian gadgets have steadily\ngrown since their introduction, little progress has been made in overcoming the\nlimitations of the gadgets themselves.

Based on this analysis, we construct two local gap models\nthat realize generalized gradient approximation (GGA) correlation functionals\nsatisfying numerous exact constraints for the correlation energy. The first\none, named GAPc, fulfills the full second-order correlation gradient expansion\nat any density regime, is very accurate for jellium surfaces, comparable to\nstate-of-the-art GGAs for atomic systems and molecular systems, and well\ncompatible with known semilocal exchange. The second functional, named GAPloc,\nis satisfying the same exact conditions, except that the second-order gradient\nexpansion is sacrificed for a better behavior under the Thomas-Fermi scaling\nand a more realistic correlation energy density of the hellium atom. The GAPloc\nfunctional displays a high accuracy for atomic correlation energies, still\npreserving a reasonable behavior for jellium surfaces. Moreover, it shows a\nhigher compatibility with the Hartree-Fock exchange than other semilocal\ncorrelation functionals. This feature is explained in terms of the real-space\nanalysis of the GAPloc correlation energy.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 4 figures"]}]

In this research, we\nproposed a novel model based on the low rank approximation (LRA) to detect the\nfunctional regions using the data from about 15 million check-in records during\na yearlong period in Shanghai, China. We find a series of latent structures,\ncalled urban spatial-temporal activity structure (USTAS). While interpreting\nthese structures, a series of outstanding underlying associations between the\nspatial and temporal activity patterns can be found. Moreover, we can not only\nreproduce the observed data with a lower dimensional representative but also\nsimultaneously project both the spatial and temporal activity patterns in the\nsame coordinate system. By utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm, five\nsignificant types of clusters which are directly annotated with a corresponding\ncombination of temporal activities can be obtained. This provides a clear\npicture of how the groups of regions are associated with different activities\nat different time of day. Besides the commercial and transportation dominant\narea, we also detect two kinds of residential areas, the developed residential\nareas and the developing residential areas. We further verify the spatial\ndistribution of these clusters in the view of urban form analysis. The results\nshows a high consistency with the government planning from the same periods,\nindicating our model is applicable for inferring the functional regions via\nsocial media check-in data, and can benefit a wide range of fields, such as\nurban planning, public services and location-based recommender systems and\nother purposes.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 11 figures, 34 references"]}]

In this paper we show that in strong curved magnetic fields a\nsignificant fraction of the energy of relativistic electrons can be radiated\naway in the intermediate, the so-called synchro-curvature regime. Because of\nthe persistent change of the trajectory curvature, the radiation varies with\nthe frequency of particle gyration. While this effect can be ignored in the\nsynchrotron and curvature regimes, the variability plays a key role in the\nformation of the synchro-curvature radiation. Using the Hamiltonian formalism,\nwe find that the particle trajectory has the form of a helix wound around the\ndrift trajectory. This allows us to calculate analytically the intensity and\nenergy distribution of prompt radiation in the general case of magnetic\nbremsstrahlung in the curved magnetic field. We show that the transition to the\nlimit of the synchrotron and curvature radiation regimes is determined by the\nrelation between the drift velocity and the component of the particle velocity\nperpendicular to the drift trajectory. The detailed numerical calculations,\nwhich take into account the energy losses of particles, confirm the principal\nconclusions based on the simplified analytical treatment of the problem, and\nallow us to analyze quantitatively the transition between different radiation\nregimes for a broad range of initial pitch angles.

One possible mechanism for the occurrence of such rare,\nunusually-intense waves is nonlinear wave focusing. Recent results have\ndemonstrated that random localizations of energy, induced by the dispersive\nmixing of different harmonics, can grow significantly due to localized\nnonlinear focusing. Here we show how the interplay between i) statistical\nproperties captured through linear information such as the waves power spectrum\nand ii) nonlinear dynamical properties of focusing localized wave groups\ndefines a critical length scale associated with the formation of extreme\nevents. The energy that is locally concentrated over this length scale acts as\nthe \"trigger\" of nonlinear focusing for wave groups and the formation of\nsubsequent rare events.

Unfortunately, recent attempts to model this\ntransport in global simulations have produced results that are not consistent\nwith any of these idealized models. In an effort to explain the discrepancies\nbetween global simulations and idealized models, we here use three-dimensional\nlocal Cartesian simulations of compressible convection to study the efficiency\nof transport by meridional flows below a convection zone in several parameter\nregimes of relevance to the Sun and solar-type stars.

One of the simplest models that\nretains the relevant dynamics of turbulent self-organization is a barotropic\nflow in a beta-plane channel with turbulence sustained by random stirring.\nNon-linear integrations of this model show that as the energy input rate of the\nforcing is increased, the homogeneity of the flow is first broken by the\nemergence of non-zonal, coherent, westward propagating structures and at larger\nenergy input rates by the emergence of zonal jets. The emergence of both\nnon-zonal coherent structures and zonal jets is studied using a statistical\ntheory, Stochastic Structural Stability Theory (S3T). S3T directly models a\nsecond-order approximation to the statistical mean turbulent state and allows\nthe identification of statistical turbulent equilibria and study of their\nstability. Using S3T, the bifurcation properties of the homogeneous state in\nbarotropic beta-plane turbulence are determined. Analytic expressions for the\nzonal and non-zonal large-scale coherent flows that emerge as a result of\nstructural instability are obtained and the equilibration of the incipient\ninstabilities is studied through numerical integrations of the S3T dynamical\nsystem. The dynamics underlying the formation of zonal jets are also\ninvestigated. It is shown that zonal jets form from the upgradient momentum\nfluxes that result from the shearing of the eddies by the emerging\ninfinitesimal large-scale flow. Finally, numerical simulations of the nonlinear\nequations confirm the characteristics (scale, amplitude and phase speed) of the\nstructures predicted by S3T, even in highly non-linear parameter regimes such\nas the regime of zonostrophic turbulence.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 14 figures, submitted to \"Zonal jets\" by Galperin B. and\n  Read, P.L.
