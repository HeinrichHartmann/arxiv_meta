We study the asymmetry of the Lipschitz metric $d_R$ on the\n(relative) Outer space $\\mathcal{O}$. More specifically, we generalise the\nconstruction of Algom-Kfir and Bestvina, introducing an (asymmetric) Finsler\nnorm $\\|\\cdot\\|^{L}$ that induces $d_R$. Let's denote by $Out(G, \\mathcal{O})$\nthe outer automorphisms of $G$ that preserve the set of conjugacy classes of\n$G_i$'s. Then there is an $Out(G, \\mathcal{O})$-invariant function $\\Psi :\n\\mathcal{O} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that when $\\| \\cdot \\|^{L}$ is\ncorrected by $d \\Psi$, the resulting norm is quasisymmetric. As an application,\nwe prove that if we restrict $d_R$ to the $\\epsilon$-thick part of the relative\nOuter space for some $\\epsilon >0$, is quasi-symmetric . Finally, we generalise\nfor IWIP automorphisms of a free product a theorem of Handel and Mosher, which\nstates that there is a uniform bound which depends only on the group, on the\nratio of the relative expansion factors of any IWIP $\\phi \\in Out(F_n)$ and its\ninverse.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1408.0544 by other authors"]}]
