This first\ncontribution also allows us to provide a robustness analysis for two other\npreconditionings. The first one is pre-whitening, which can be interpreted as\nan optimal solution of the same SDP with additional constraints. We analyze\nrobustness of pre-whitening which allows us to characterize situations in which\nit performs competitively with the SDP-based preconditioning. The second one is\nbased on SPA itself and can be interpreted as an optimal solution of a\nrelaxation of the SDP. It is extremely fast while competing with the SDP-based\npreconditioning on several synthetic data sets.\n","Comment: 25 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In this model, a group of\nidentical tokens are initially placed at nodes of the graph. Each node\nmaintains a cyclic ordering of the outgoing arcs, and during consecutive turns\nthe tokens are propagated along arcs chosen according to this ordering in\nround-robin fashion. The behavior of the model is fully deterministic. Yanovski\net al.(2003) proved that a single rotor-router walk on any graph with m edges\nand diameter $D$ stabilizes to a traversal of an Eulerian circuit on the set of\nall 2m directed arcs on the edge set of the graph, and that such periodic\nbehaviour of the system is achieved after an initial transient phase of at most\n2mD steps. The case of multiple parallel rotor-routers was studied\nexperimentally, leading Yanovski et al. to the conjecture that a system of $k\n\\textgreater{} 1$ parallel walks also stabilizes with a period of length at\nmost $2m$ steps. In this work we disprove this conjecture, showing that the\nperiod of parallel rotor-router walks can in fact, be superpolynomial in the\nsize of graph. On the positive side, we provide a characterization of the\nperiodic behavior of parallel router walks, in terms of a structural property\nof stable states called a subcycle decomposition.

Thus, we are able to\npredict any future behavior of the system using an algorithm that takes\npolynomial time and space. In addition, we show that there exists a separation\nbetween the stabilization time of the single-walk and multiple-walk\nrotor-router systems, and that for some graphs the latter can be asymptotically\nlarger even for the case of $k = 2$ walks.\n"]}]

For antiferromagnetic molecular nanomagnets with\nfinite number of even-numbered coupled spins, tunneling involves two classical\nlocalized N\\'eel ground states separated by a magnetic energy barrier. The\nquestion is: can such phenomena be observed in nano magnets with odd number of\nmagnetic ions?

These frustrated spins can indeed be observed experimentally, so they\nare of interest. In this Letter, we theoretically investigate macroscopic\nquantum tunneling in these odd spin systems with arbitrary spins $s$, in the\npresence of a magnetic field applied along the plane of the magnet. In contrast\nto systems with an even-numbered coupled spins, the ground state of the cyclic\nodd-spin system contains a topological soliton due to spin frustration. Thus\nthe classical ground state is $2N$-fold degenerate as the soliton can be placed\nanywhere along the ring with total $S_z=\\pm s$. Small quantum fluctuations\ndelocalize the soliton with a formation of an energy band. We obtain this\nenergy band using degenerate perturbation theory at order $2s$. We show that\nthe soliton ground state is chiral for half-odd integer spins and non-chiral\nfor integer spins.

One aim of the present review is\nto address the dichotomy between the great reception SOC has received in some\nareas, and its shortcomings, as they became manifest in the controversies it\ntriggered. Our article tries to clear up what we think are misunderstandings of\nSOC in fields more remote from its origins in statistical mechanics, condensed\nmatter and dynamical systems by revisiting Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld's original\npapers.\n","Comment: 52 pages, 3 figures"]}]

In this paper, we focus on a very\nsensitive and increasingly exposed type of data: location data. There are two\nmain scenarios in which fake traces are of extreme value to preserve location\nprivacy: publishing datasets of location trajectories, and using location-based\nservices. Despite advances in protecting (location) data privacy, there is no\nquantitative method to evaluate how realistic a synthetic trace is, and how\nmuch utility and privacy it provides in each scenario. Also, the lack of a\nmethodology to generate privacy-preserving fake traces is evident. In this\npaper, we fill this gap and propose the first statistical metric and model to\ngenerate fake location traces such that both the utility of data and the\nprivacy of users are preserved. We build upon the fact that, although\ngeographically they visit distinct locations, people have strongly semantically\nsimilar mobility patterns, for example, their transition pattern across\nactivities (e.g., working, driving, staying at home) is similar. We define a\nstatistical metric and propose an algorithm that automatically discovers the\nhidden semantic similarities between locations from a bag of real location\ntraces as seeds, without requiring any initial semantic annotations. We\nguarantee that fake traces are geographically dissimilar to their seeds, so\nthey do not leak sensitive location information. We also protect contributors\nto seed traces against membership attacks. Interleaving fake traces with mobile\nusers' traces is a prominent location privacy defense mechanism. We\nquantitatively show the effectiveness of our methodology in protecting against\nlocalization inference attacks while preserving utility of sharing/publishing\ntraces.\n"]}]

We observe two major problems when such an approach is\nadapted to a heterogeneous CPU-HWA system. First, HWAs miss deadlines because\nthey are prioritized only close to their deadlines. Second, such an approach\ndoes not consider the diverse memory access characteristics of different\napplications running on CPUs and HWAs, leading to low performance for\nlatency-sensitive CPU applications and deadline misses for some HWAs, including\nGPUs.\n  In this paper, we propose a Simple Quality of service Aware memory Scheduler\nfor Heterogeneous systems (SQUASH), that overcomes these problems using three\nkey ideas, with the goal of meeting deadlines of HWAs while providing high CPU\nperformance. First, SQUASH prioritizes a HWA when it is not on track to meet\nits deadline any time during a deadline period. Second, SQUASH prioritizes HWAs\nover memory-intensive CPU applications based on the observation that the\nperformance of memory-intensive applications is not sensitive to memory\nlatency. Third, SQUASH treats short-deadline HWAs differently as they are more\nlikely to miss their deadlines and schedules their requests based on worst-case\nmemory access time estimates.\n  Extensive evaluations across a wide variety of different workloads and\nsystems show that SQUASH achieves significantly better CPU performance than the\nbest previous scheduler while always meeting the deadlines for all HWAs,\nincluding GPUs, thereby largely improving frame rates.\n"]}]

For 3D Monte Carlo codes, this requires\nalgorithms to efficiently generate random positions from 3D density\ndistributions. We describe the design of a flexible suite of components for the\nMonte Carlo radiative transfer code SKIRT. The design is based on a combination\nof basic building blocks (which can be either analytical toy models or\nnumerical models defined on grids or a set of particles) and the extensive use\nof decorators that combine and alter these building blocks to more complex\nstructures. For a number of decorators, e.g. those that add spiral structure or\nclumpiness, we provide a detailed description of the algorithms that can be\nused to generate random positions. Advantages of this decorator-based design\ninclude code transparency, the avoidance of code duplication, and an increase\nin code maintainability. Moreover, since decorators can be chained without\nproblems, very complex models can easily be constructed out of simple building\nblocks. Finally, based on a number of test simulations, we demonstrate that our\ndesign using customised random position generators is superior to a simpler\ndesign based on a generic black-box random position generator.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and\n  Computing"]}]
