A common approach is to use data augmentation to include these capture\nprobabilities directly into the likelihood and fit the model using Bayesian\ninference via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

We studied the dependence on the magnetic field\nsweep prehistory (minor loop measurements), recovered the anhysteretic curve,\nand studied the time dependence of the magnetoresistance. We showed that the\nhysteresis of magnetoresistance of a 2DEG in the QHE regime has significant\nphenomenological similarities with the hysteresis of magnetization of\nferromagnetic materials, showing multistability, jumps of relaxation, and\nhaving the anhysteretic curve. Nevertheless, we revealed the crucial\ndifference, manifested itself in an unusual inverted (anti-coercive) behavior\nof the magnetoresistance hysteresis. The time relaxation of the hysteresis has\nfast and slow regimes, similar to that of non-equilibrium magnetization of a\n2DEG in QHE regime pointing to their common origin. We studied the dependence\nof the hysteresis loop area on the lithographic width of the constriction and\nfound the threshold value of width $\\sim$1.35 $\\mu$m beyond which the\nhysteresis is not observed. This points to the edge nature of the\nnon-equilibrium currents (NECs) and allows us to determine the width of the\nNECs area ($\\sim$0.5 $\\mu$m). We suggest the qualitative picture of the\nobserved hysteresis, based on non-equilibrium redistribution of the electrons\namong the Landau level states and assuming huge imbalance between the\npopulation of bulk and edge electronic states.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures.

An\naccurate $J-a_{\\text{sym}}$ thus places a strong constraint on the $\\Delta\nR_{np}$. Compared with the parity-violating asymmetry $A_{\\text{PV}}$ in the\nPREX, the reliably experimental information on the $J-a_{\\text{sym}}$ is much\nmore easily available attributed to a wealth of measured data on nuclear masses\nand on decay energies. The density dependence of the symmetry energy is also\nwell constrained with the $J-a_{\\text{sym}}$. Finally, with a `tomoscan'\nmethod, we find that one just needs to measure the nucleon densities in\n$^{208}$Pb starting from $R_{m} = 7.61\\pm0.04$ fm to obtain the $\\Delta R_{np}$\nin hadron scattering experiments, regardless of its interior profile that is\nhampered by the strong absorption.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures"]}]

Closer to computer\nscience, embedded systems and Systems of Systems are further examples of\ninteracting systems. Common to all of these is that some \"whole\" is made up of\nconstituent parts, and these parts interact with each other. By design, these\ninteractions are intentional, but it is the unintended interactions that are\nproblematic. The Systems of Systems literature uses the terms \"constituent\nsystems\" and \"constituents\" to refer to systems that interact with each other.\nThat practice is followed here. This paper presents a visual formalism, Swim\nLane Event-Driven Petri Nets, that is proposed as a basis for Model-Based\nTesting (MBT) of interacting systems. In the absence of available tools, this\nmodel can only support the offline form of Model-Based Testing.\n","Comment: In Proceedings MBT 2015, arXiv:1504.01928"]}]

Compared to non-variable systems, testing SPLs is extensive\ndue to an increasingly amount of possible products. Different approaches exist\nfor testing SPLs, but there is less research for assessing the quality of these\ntests by means of error detection capability. Such test assessment is based on\nerror injection into correct version of the system under test. However to our\nknowledge, potential errors in SPL engineering have never been systematically\nidentified before. This article presents an overview over existing paradigms\nfor specifying software product lines and the errors that can occur during the\nrespective specification processes. For assessment of test quality, we leverage\nmutation testing techniques to SPL engineering and implement the identified\nerrors as mutation operators. This allows us to run existing tests against\ndefective products for the purpose of test assessment. From the results, we\ndraw conclusions about the error-proneness of the surveyed SPL design paradigms\nand how quality of SPL tests can be improved.\n","Comment: In Proceedings MBT 2015, arXiv:1504.01928"]}]

Used\nto model a particular phenomenon or process, graphs are then typically analysed\nto find out properties of the modelled subject, or transformed to construct\nother types of models.\n  The workshop aimed at attracting and stimulating research on the techniques\nfor graph analysis, inspection and transformation, on a general level rather\nthan in any specific domain. In total, we received 15 submissions covering\nseveral different areas. Of these 15 submissions, nine were eventually accepted\nand appear in this volume.\n"]}]
