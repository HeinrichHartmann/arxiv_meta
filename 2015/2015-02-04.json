We nonetheless show that this separation is possible, and delineate its\nfundamental basis in undulatory swimmers.

For example, we demonstrate that the\ndrag-thrust separation framework helps to predict the observed height of the\nribbon fin of electric knifefish, a diverse group of neotropical fishes which\nare an important model system in sensory neurobiology.

The size and shape of the growing aggregates\ndetermine the efficiency of this early growth. It has been proposed that fluffy\nice aggregates can grow very efficiently, suffering less from the bouncing and\nradial drift barriers. While the collision velocity between icy aggregates of\nsimilar size is thought to stay below the fragmentation threshold, they may\nnonetheless lose mass from collisions with much smaller projectiles. We\ninvestigate the effect of these erosive collisions on the ability of porous ice\naggregates to cross the radial drift barrier. We develop a Monte Carlo code\nthat calculates the evolution of the growing aggregates, while resolving the\nentire mass distribution at all times. The aggregate's porosity is treated\nindependently of its mass, and is determined by collisions, gas compaction, and\neventually self-gravity compaction. For erosion threshold velocities of 20-40\nm/s, high-velocity collisions with small projectiles prevent the largest\naggregates from growing when they start to drift. In these cases, our local\nsimulations result in a steady-state distribution, with the majority of the\ndust mass in particles with Stokes numbers close to unity. Only for the highest\nerosion threshold considered (60 m/s), do porous aggregates manage to cross the\nradial drift barrier in the inner 10 AU of MMSN-like disks. Erosive collisions\nare more effective in limiting the growth than fragmentary collisions between\nsimilar-size particles. Conceivably, erosion limits the growth before the\nradial drift barrier, although the robustness of this statement depends on\n(uncertain) material properties of icy aggregates.

Our analysis shows that the\nthermal emission of 3C400.2 can be well explained by a two component\nnon-equilibrium ionization model, of which one component is underionized, has a\nhigh temperature ($kT \\approx 3.9$ keV) and super-solar abundances, while the\nother component has a much lower temperature ($kT \\approx 0.14$ keV), solar\nabundances and shows signs of overionization.

This seems to be the first\ninstance of an overionized plasma found in the outer regions of a supernova\nremnant, whereas the ejecta component of the inner region is underionized. In\naddition, the non-ionization equilibrium plasma component associated with the\nejecta is confined to the central, brighter parts of the remnant, whereas the\ncooler component is present mostly in the outer regions. Therefore our data can\nmost naturally be explained by an evolutionary scenario in which the outer\nparts of the remnant are cooling rapidly due to having swept up high density\nISM, while the inner parts are very hot and cooling inefficiently due to low\ndensity of the plasma.

Treating\nthe Universe as a dynamical system it is natural to assume that it is\nnon-linear: indeed, linearity is nothing more than approximation, while\nnon-linearity represents the generic case. It is evident that future models of\nthe Universe must take into account different aspects of its evolution. As soon\nas the scale factor is the only dynamical variable, the quantities which\ndetermine its time dependence must be essentially present in all aspects of the\nUniverse' evolution. Basic characteristics of the cosmological evolution, both\nstatic and dynamical, can be expressed in terms of the parameters ${{H}_{0}}$\nand ${{q}_{0}}$. The very parameters (and higher time derivatives of the scale\nfactor) enable us to construct model-independent kinematics of the cosmological\nexpansion.\n  Time dependence of the scale factor reflects main events in history of the\nUniverse. Moreover it is the deceleration parameter who dictates the expansion\nrate of the Hubble sphere and determines the dynamics of the observable galaxy\nnumber variation: depending on the sign of the deceleration parameter this\nnumber either grows (in the case of decelerated expansion), or we are going to\nstay absolutely alone in the cosmos (if the expansion is accelerated).\n  The intended purpose of the report is reflected in its title --- \"Cosmology\nin terms of the deceleration parameter\".

This representation\nextends the well-known concept of harmonic maps and allows us to describe some\nsolutions to the Einstein field equations as generalized strings, where the\nbase space for the generalized harmonic map is a two-dimensional manifold. The\nresults obtained here point to an incompatibility of the classical description\nof the gravitational field and its symmetries with a discretization of the\nparameters that enter in its description.\n","Comment: 23 pages"]}]
