As experiments grow more sophisticated, and head\ntowards multiple qubit architectures that enable small scale computation, it\nbecomes important to consider the charge read-out overhead.

Although hidden mechanical momentum is indeed dominant for\nnon-interacting particles moving in a closed orbit under the influence of an\nexternal electric field, the attention directed toward hidden mechanical\nmomentum represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the classical\nelectromagnetic interaction between a multiparticle magnet and an external\npoint charge. In the interacting multiparticle situation, the external charge\ninduces an electrostatic polarization of the magnet which leads to an internal\nelectromagnetic momentum in the magnet where both the electric and magnetic\nfields for the momentum are contributed by the magnet particles. This internal\nelectromagnetic momentum for the interacting multiparticle situation is equal\nin magnitude and opposite in direction compared to the familiar external\nelectromagnetic momentum where the electric field is contributed by the\nexternal charged particle and the magnetic field is that due to the magnet. In\nthe present article, the momentum balance of the Shockley-James situation for a\nsystem of a magnet and a point charge is calculated in detail for a magnet\nmodel consisting of two interacting point charges which are constrained to move\nin a circular orbit on a frictionless ring with a compensating negative charge\nat the center.\n","Comment: 25 pages"]}]

Such systems may be constructed, for example, by coupling a\ngapped two dimensional state of matter that carries edge states to a gapless\ntwo dimensional system in which the spectrum is composed of a number of Dirac\ncones. We find that in the absence of disorder the edge states could be\nprotected even when the two systems are coupled, due to momentum and energy\nconservation. We distinguish between weak and strong edge states by the level\nof their mixing with the bulk. In the presence of disorder, the edge states may\nbe stabilized when the bulk is localized or destabilized when the bulk is\nmetallic. We analyze the conditions under which these two cases occur.

This problem has been a subject of extensive\nstudy in the past decade, and the resulting dynamic and opportunistic channel\naccess schemes can bring potentially significant improvement over traditional\nschemes. However, a common and severe limitation of these dynamic schemes is\nthat they almost always require some form of a priori knowledge of the channel\nstatistics. A natural remedy is a learning framework, which has also been\nextensively studied in the same context, but a typical learning algorithm in\nthis literature seeks only the best static policy, with performance measured by\nweak regret, rather than learning a good dynamic channel access policy. There\nis thus a clear disconnect between what an optimal channel access policy can\nachieve with known channel statistics that actively exploits temporal, spatial\nand spectral diversity, and what a typical existing learning algorithm aims\nfor, which is the static use of a single channel devoid of diversity gain. In\nthis paper we bridge this gap by designing learning algorithms that track known\noptimal or sub-optimal dynamic channel access and transmission scheduling\npolicies, thereby yielding performance measured by a form of strong regret, the\naccumulated difference between the reward returned by an optimal solution when\na priori information is available and that by our online algorithm.

Since the expected migration time from internal disk\nregions that emit most of the optical flux to the orbit of the companion star\nis of several years, the simultaneity of the high energy and optical fluxes\nvariations indicates that X-ray emission arises from close to the star. The\nsystematic lack of magnetic field detection reported in recent\nspectro-polarimetric surveys of Be stars is consistent with the absence of\nstrong magnetic wind braking in these fast spinning stars but put strong\nconstraints on the possible origin of the magnetic field.

By manipulating the disorder in this material, we observe crystal\nstructure changes and detect improvements in the majority carrier (hole)\ntransport. However, when the minority carrier (electron) transport was\ninvestigated using optical pump terahertz probe spectroscopy, minimal\ndifferences were observed between the ordered and disordered Cu$_2$SnS$_3$. By\ncombining these results with first-principles and Monte Carlo theoretical\ncalculations, we are able to conclude that even ostensibly \"ordered\"\nCu$_2$SnS$_3$ displays minority carrier transport properties corresponding to\nthe disordered structure. The presence of extended planar defects in all\nsamples, observed in TEM imaging, suggests that disorder is present even when\nit is not detectable using traditional structural characterization methods. The\nresults of this study highlight some of the challenges to the further\nimprovement of Cu$_2$SnS$_3$-based photovoltaics, and have implications for\nother disordered multinary semiconductors such as CZTS.\n"]}]
