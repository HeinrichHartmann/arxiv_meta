The main feature of SGP is the\npresence of a variable scaling matrix multiplying the gradient, which may\nchange at each iteration. In the last few years, an extensive numerical\nexperimentation showed that SGP equipped with a suitable choice of the scaling\nmatrix is a very effective tool for solving large scale variational problems\narising in image and signal processing. In spite of the very reliable numerical\nresults observed, only a weak, though very general, convergence theorem is\nprovided, establishing that any limit point of the sequence generated by SGP is\nstationary. Here, under the only assumption that the objective function is\nconvex and that a solution exists, we prove that the sequence generated by SGP\nconverges to a minimum point, if the scaling matrices sequence satisfies a\nsimple and implementable condition. Moreover, assuming that the gradient of the\nobjective function is Lipschitz continuous, we are also able to prove the\nO(1/k) convergence rate with respect to the objective function values.

The Louvain algorithm was originally developed for\noptimizing modularity, but has been applied to a variety of methods. As such,\nspeeding up the Louvain algorithm, enables the analysis of larger graphs in a\nshorter time for various methods.

In both the methods we\nfind that for a finite $\\Delta$ and at zero temperature, anti-ferromagnetic\n(AFM) order sets in beyond a threshold $U=U_{AF}$ via a first order phase\ntransition below which the system is a paramagnetic band insulator.

We show that the results obtained within both the methods\nhave good qualitative and quantitative consistency in the intermediate to\nstrong coupling regime. On increasing the temperature, the AFM order is lost\nvia a first order phase transition at a transition temperature $T_{AF}(U,\n\\Delta)$ within both the methods, for weak to intermediate values of U/t. But\nin the strongly correlated regime, where the effective low energy Hamiltonian\nis the Heisenberg model, IPT is unable to capture the thermal (Neel) transition\nfrom the AFM phase to the paramagnetic phase, but the CTQMC does.

At $U_N > U_{AF}$, when\nthe Neel temperature $T_N$ for the effective Heisenberg model becomes lower\nthan T, the AFM order is lost via a second order transition.

We find that the resulting\nredshift and properties of the shadow depend crucially on whether the final\noutcome of the complete gravitational collapse is a black hole or a naked\nsingularity. In the black hole case, the shadow is due to the high redshift\nacquired by the photons as they approach the event horizon, implying that their\nenergy is gradually redshifted toward zero within a few crossing times\nassociated with the event horizon radius. In contrast to this, a naked\nsingularity not only absorbs photons originating from the source, but it also\nemits infinitely redshifted photons with and without angular momenta. This\nemission introduces an abrupt cutoff in the frequency shift of the photons\ndetected in directions close to the radial one, and it is responsible for the\nshadow masking the source in the naked singularity case. Furthermore, even\nthough the shadow forms and begins to grow immediately after the observer\ncrosses the Cauchy horizon, it takes many more crossing times than in the black\nhole case for the source to be occulted from the observer's eyes. We discuss\npossible implications of our results for testing the weak cosmic censorship\nhypothesis. Even though at late times the image of the source perceived by the\nobserver looks the same in both cases, the dynamical formation of the shadow\nand the redshift images has distinct features and time scales in the black hole\nversus the naked singularity case.

Here, we have a set of\npoints in the plane and we want to connect them with straight line segments,\nsuch that there is a path between each pair of points that does not make a\nlarge detour. If we achieve this, the resulting graph is called a spanner. We\nfocus our attention on $\\Theta$-graphs, which are constructed by connecting\neach point with its nearest neighbour in a fixed number of cones. Although this\nconstruction is very straight-forward, it has proven challenging to fully\ndetermine the properties of the resulting graphs.

We show that our routing strategy finds a path whose length is at\nmost a constant factor from the straight-line distance between the endpoints.\nMoreover, we show that this routing strategy is optimal.\n  In the second part, we turn our attention to flips in triangulations. A flip\nis a simple operation that transforms one triangulation into another. It turns\nout that with enough flips, we can transform any triangulation into any other.\nBut how many flips is enough? We present an improved upper bound of $5.2n -\n33.6$ on the maximum flip distance between any pair of triangulations with n\nvertices. Along the way, we prove matching lower bounds on each step in the\ncurrent algorithm, including a tight bound of $(3n - 9)/5$ flips needed to make\na triangulation 4-connected.

In fact both commonplaces are wrong.\nOgievetsky and Polubarinov (OP) constructed spinors in coordinates in 1965,\nenhancing the unity of physics and helping to spawn nonlinear group\nrepresentations. Roughly and locally, OP spinors resemble the orthonormal basis\nor tetrad formalism in the symmetric gauge, but they are conceptually\nself-sufficient and more economical. The tetrad formalism is thus\nde-Ockhamized, with six extra components and six compensating gauge symmetries.\nAs developed nonperturbatively by Bilyalov, OP spinors admit any coordinates at\na point, but 'time' must be listed first; 'time' is defined by an eigenvalue\nproblem involving the metric and diag(-1,1,1,1), the product of which must have\nno negative eigenvalues. Thus even formal general covariance requires\nreconsideration; admissible coordinates should be sensitive to the types and\n_values_ of the fields. Apart from coordinate order and the usual spinorial\ntwo-valuedness, (densitized) Ogievetsky-Polubarinov spinors form, with the\n(conformal part of the) metric, a nonlinear geometric object, with Lie and\ncovariant derivatives. The mild consequences of coordinate order are explored\nfor the conventionality of simultaneity in Special Relativity and the\nSchwarzschild solution in General Relativity.\n","Comment: Abbreviated relative of arXiv:1111.4586"]}]

Using a Semi-Analytical Shower Model"],"description":["  The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) is an array of five Imaging\nAtmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed to detect cosmogenic\ngamma-rays with very high energies. Originally consisting of just four\nidentical IACTs (CT1-4) with an effective mirror diameter of 12$\\,$m each, it\nwas expanded with a fifth IACT (CT5) with a mirror diameter of 28$\\,$m in 2012.\nBeing the largest IACT worldwide, CT5 allows to lower the energy threshold of\nH.E.S.S., making the array sensitive at energies where space-based detectors\nrun out of statistics. Events can be analysed either monoscopically (i.e. using\nonly information of CT5) or stereoscopically (requiring at least two triggered\ntelescopes per event). To achieve a good performance, a sophisticated event\nreconstruction and analysis framework is indispensable. This is particularly\nimportant for H.E.S.S. since it is now the first IACT array that consists of\ndifferent telescope types. An advanced reconstruction method is based on a\nsemi-analytical model of electromagnetic particle showers in the atmosphere\n(model analysis). The properties of the primary particle are reconstructed by\ncomparing the image recorded by each triggered telescope with the Cherenkov\nemission from the shower model using a log-likelihood maximisation. Due to its\nperformance, this method has become one of the standard analysis techniques\napplied to CT1-4 data. Now it has been modified for use with the five-telescope\narray. We present the adapted model analysis and its performance in both\nmonoscopic and stereoscopic analysis mode.\n","Comment: In Proceedings of the 34th International Cosmic Ray Conference\n  (ICRC2015), The Hague, The Netherlands"]}]

To obtain physically meaningful\nparameters of stars, from basic luminosities and effective temperatures to\nmasses and ages, we must understand and measure the local extinction law. This\nproblem affects all the massive young clusters discussed in his volume. We have\ndeveloped a powerful method to unambiguously determine the extinction law in an\nuniform way across a cluster field, using multi-band photometry of red giant\nstars belonging to the red clump (RC). In the Large Magellanic Cloud, with\nabout 20 RC stars per arcmin^2, we can easily derive a solid and\nself-consistent absolute extinction curve over the entire wavelength range of\nthe photometry.
