However, the morphodynamics of sediment landscapes emerging due to\nsurface transport of sediment is controlled by situations out-of-equilibrium.\nIn particular, it is controlled by the saturation length characterizing the\ndistance it takes for the particle flux to reach a new equilibrium after a\nchange in flow conditions.

When these quantum corrections become large\nat low temperatures, the calculation of thermal conductivity demands a\ntheoretical approach that treats disorder and interactions on an equal footing.\nIn this paper, we develop such an approach by merging Luttinger's idea of using\ngravitational potentials for the analysis of thermal phenomena with a\nrenormalization group calculation based on the Keldysh nonlinear sigma model.\nThe gravitational potentials are introduced in the action as auxiliary sources\nthat couple to the heat density.

Already in the absence of the gravitational potentials,\nthe nonlinear sigma model contains several temperature-dependent\nrenormalization group charges. When the gravitational potentials are introduced\ninto the model, they acquire an independent renormalization group flow. We show\nthat this flow preserves the phenomenological form of the correlation function,\nreflecting its relation to the specific heat and the constraints imposed by\nenergy conservation.

We begin with an initial set of active vertices. The\nprocess then proceeds in rounds, and further vertices become active as soon as\nthey have a certain number of active neighbors. A recurring feature in\nbootstrap percolation theory is an `all-or-nothing' phenomenon: either the size\nof the starting set is so small that the process stops very soon, or it\npercolates (almost) completely.\n  Motivated by several important phenomena observed in various types of\nreal-world networks we propose in this work a variant of bootstrap percolation\nthat exhibits a vastly different behavior. Our graphs have two types of\nvertices: some of them obstruct the diffusion, while the others facilitate it.\nWe study the effect of this setting by analyzing the process on\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs. Our main findings are two-fold. First we show\nthat the presence of vertices hindering the diffusion does not result in a\nstable behavior: tiny changes in the size of the starting set can dramatically\ninfluence the size of the final active set. In particular, the process is\nnon-monotone: a larger starting set can result in a smaller final set. In the\nsecond part of the paper we show that this phenomenom arises from the\nround-based approach: if we move to a continuous time model in which every edge\ndraws its transmission time randomly, then we gain stability, and the process\nstops with an active set that contains a non-trivial constant fraction of all\nvertices. Moreover, we show that in the continuous time model percolation\noccurs significantly faster compared to the classical round-based model. Our\nfindings are in line with empirical observations and demonstrate the importance\nof introducing various types of vertex behaviors in the mathematical model.\n"]}]

We call the model ELM for \"Energy Landscape\nModel\". We postulate that the spectrum of the scattered neutrons consists of\nlines of natural width shifted from the center by fluctuations. ELM is based on\ntwo facts: Neutrons are wave packets; proteins have low-lying substates that\nform the free-energy landscape (FEL). Experiments suggest that the wave packets\nare a few hundred micrometers long. The interaction between the neutron and a\nproton in the protein takes place during the transit of the wave packet. The\nwave packet exerts the force $F(t) = dQ(t)/dt$ on the protein moiety, a part of\nthe protein surrounding the struck proton. $Q(t)$ is the wave vector (momentum)\ntransferred by the neutron wave packet to the proton during the transit. The\nensuing energy is stored in the energy landscape and returned to the neutron as\nthe wave packet exits. Kinetic energy thus is changed into potential energy and\nback. The interaction energy is proportional to $Q$, not to $Q^2$. To develop\nand check the ELM, we use published work on dehydrated proteins after reversing\nimproper normalizations. In such proteins only vibrations are active and the\neffects caused by the neutron momentum can be studied undisturbed by external\nfluctuations. ELM has predictive power.

Under HCN,\nSCs can be dynamically turned off when traffic load decreases for energy\nsaving. A fundamental problem then arises: how many SCs can be turned off as\ntraffic varies? In this paper, we address this problem in a theoretical way,\nwhere two sleeping schemes (i.e., random and repulsive schemes) with vertical\ninter-layer offloading are considered. Analytical results indicate the\nfollowing facts: (1) Under the random scheme where SCs are turned off with\ncertain probability, the expected ratio of sleeping SCs is inversely\nproportional to the traffic load of SC-layer and decreases linearly with the\ntraffic load of MBS-layer; (2) The repulsive scheme, which only turns off the\nSCs close to MBSs, is less sensitive to the traffic variations; (3) deploying\ndenser MBSs enables turning off more SCs, which may help to improve network\nenergy-efficiency.

With the new wide bandwidth capabilities of the\nVLA, an unprecedented sensitivity was achieved for all polarization products.\nThe beam resolution is an average of 9.6\" and 36\" with noise levels reaching\napproximately 6 and 30 microJy per beam for C- and L-bands, respectively\n(robust weighting). We present intensity maps in these two frequency bands (C\nand L), with different weightings, as well as spectral index maps, polarization\nmaps, and new measurements of star formation rates (SFRs). The data products\ndescribed herein are available to the public in the CHANG-ES data release\navailable at www.queensu.ca/changes. We also present evidence of a trend among\ngalaxies with larger halos having higher SFR surface density, and we show, for\nthe first time, a radio continuum image of the median galaxy, taking advantage\nof the collective signal-to-noise ratio of 30 of our galaxies.

A novel trigger strategy,\nbased on the analogue sum of signals from partially overlapped patches of\npixels, leads to a lower threshold. In 2008, this principle was proven by the\ndetection of the Crab Pulsar at 25 GeV by MAGIC in single telescope operation.\nDuring Winter 2013/14, a new system, based on this concept, was implemented for\nstereoscopic observations after several years of development.
