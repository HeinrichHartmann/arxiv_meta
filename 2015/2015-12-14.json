Both\namplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying strategies are\nconsidered. Given fixed power allocation to the channels, we show that channel\npairing over multiple hops can be decomposed into independent pairing problems\nat each relay, and a sorted-SNR channel pairing strategy is sum-rate optimal,\nwhere each relay pairs its incoming and outgoing channels by their SNR order.\nFor the joint optimization of channel pairing and power allocation under both\ntotal and individual power constraints, we show that the problem can be\ndecoupled into two subproblems solved separately. This separation principle is\nestablished by observing the equivalence between sorting SNRs and sorting\nchannel gains in the jointly optimal solution. It significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity in finding the jointly optimal solution. It follows\nthat the channel pairing problem in joint optimization can be again decomposed\ninto independent pairing problems at each relay based on sorted channel gains.\nThe solution for optimizing power allocation for DF relaying is also provided,\nas well as an asymptotically optimal solution for AF relaying. Numerical\nresults are provided to demonstrate substantial performance gain of the jointly\noptimal solution over some suboptimal alternatives. It is also observed that\nmore gain is obtained from optimal channel pairing than optimal power\nallocation through judiciously exploiting the variation among multiple\nchannels. Impact of the variation of channel gain, the number of channels, and\nthe number of hops on the performance gain is also studied through numerical\nexamples.\n","Comment: 15 pages.

We\ndo so by showing that the Weyl field associated with strain is a pure gauge\nfield and no constraint on the $(2+1)$-dimensional spacetime appears. On the\nother hand, for constant intrinsic curvature that also gives a pure-gauge Weyl\nfield, we find a classical manifestation of a quantum Weyl anomaly, descending\nfrom a constrained spacetime. We are in the position to do this because we find\nthe equations that the conformal factor in $(2+1)$-dimensions has to satisfy,\nthat is a nontrivial generalization to $(2+1)$-dimensions of the classic\nLiouville equation of differential geometry of surfaces. Finally, we comment on\nthe peculiarities of the only gauge field that can describe strain, that is the\nwell known {\\it pseudogauge field} $A_1 \\sim u_{11} - u_{22}$ and $A_2 \\sim\nu_{12}$, and conclude by offering some scenarios of fundamental physics that\nthis peculiar field could help to realize.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures.

A novel model of the gossip algorithm with\nnon-uniform clock distribution is proposed which can reach the optimal\nconvergence rate of the continuous-time consensus algorithm. It is described\nthat how the non-uniform clock distribution is achievable by modifying the rate\nof the Poisson process modeling the clock of the gossip algorithm.

When the\noscillator reaches a specific state, it emits a pulse, which returns after\npropagating through a delay line. The impact of an incoming pulse is described\nby the oscillator's phase reset curve (PRC). In such a system we discover an\nunexpected phenomenon: for a sufficiently steep slope of the PRC, a periodic\nregular spiking solution bifurcates with several multipliers crossing the unit\ncircle at the same parameter value. The number of such critical multipliers\nincreases linearly with the delay and thus may be arbitrary large.
