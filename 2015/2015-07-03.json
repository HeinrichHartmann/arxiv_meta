There are excess events in the data of\nDAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT, CRESST-II, and recently CDMS-Si, which could be consistent\nwith WIMP masses of approximately 10 GeV/c2. However, for MDM > 10 GeV/c2 null\nresults of the CDMS-Ge, XENON, and LUX detectors may be in tension with the\npotential detections for certain dark matter scenarios and assuming a certain\nlight response.\n  We propose the use of a new class of biological dark matter (DM) detectors to\nfurther examine this light dark matter hypothesis, taking advantage of new\nsignatures with low atomic number targets, Two types of biological DM detectors\nare discussed here: DNA-based detectors and enzymatic reactions (ER) based\ndetectors. In the case of DNA-based detectors, we discuss a new implementation.\nIn the case of ER detectors, there are four crucial phases of the detection\nprocess: a) change of state due to energy deposited by a particle; b)\namplification due to the release of energy derived from the action of an enzyme\non its substrate; c) sustainable but non-explosive enzymatic reaction; d)\nself-termination due to the denaturation of the enzyme, when the temperature is\nraised. This paper provides information of how to design as well as optimize\nthese four processes.\n","Comment: 29 pages"]}]

We consider\ndifferent scenarios depending on the spatial distribution of the particles,\ntheir size and the number density. In the case of uniform distribution of the\nparticles the radiation causes a modest increase of the temperature ahead of\nthe flame and the corresponding increase of the flame velocity. The effects of\nradiation preheating is stronger for a flame with smaller normal velocity. In\nthe case of non-uniform distribution of the particles, such that the particles\nnumber density is smaller just ahead of the flame and increases in the distant\nregion ahead of the flame, the preheating caused by the thermal radiation may\ntrigger additional independent source of ignition. This scenario requires the\nformation of a temperature gradient with the maximum temperature sufficient for\nignition in the region of denser particles cloud ahead of the advancing flame.\nDepending on the steepness of the temperature gradient formed in the unburned\nmixture, either deflagration or detonation can be initiated via the Zeldovich's\ngradient mechanism.

Numerical methods of the Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG)\ntype are considered for simulating waves that satisfy the Helmholtz and Maxwell\nequations. It is shown that these methods, when wrongly used, give rise to\nsingular systems for complex wavenumbers. A sufficient condition on the HDG\nstabilization parameter for guaranteeing unique solvability of the numerical\nHDG system, both for Helmholtz and Maxwell systems, is obtained for complex\nwavenumbers. For real wavenumbers, results from a dispersion analysis are\npresented. An asymptotic expansion of the dispersion relation, as the number of\nmesh elements per wave increase, reveal that some choices of the stabilization\nparameter are better than others. To summarize the findings, there are values\nof the HDG stabilization parameter that will cause the HDG method to fail for\ncomplex wavenumbers. However, this failure is remedied if the real part of the\nstabilization parameter has the opposite sign of the imaginary part of the\nwavenumber. When the wavenumber is real, values of the stabilization parameter\nthat asymptotically minimize the HDG wavenumber errors are found on the\nimaginary axis.

The\nsupersymmetric counterpart of this model, although much less ubiquitous, has an\nequally rich structure. In particular, its eigenfunctions, the Jack\nsuperpolynomials, appear to share the very same remarkable combinatorial and\nstructural properties as their non-supersymmetric version. These\nsuper-functions are parametrized by superpartitions with fixed bosonic and\nfermionic degrees. Now, a truly amazing feature pops out when the fermionic\ndegree is sufficiently large: the Jack superpolynomials stabilize and\nfactorize. Their stability is with respect to their expansion in terms of an\nelementary basis where, in the stable sector, the expansion coefficients become\nindependent of the fermionic degree. Their factorization is seen when the\nfermionic variables are stripped off in a suitable way which results in a\nproduct of two ordinary Jack polynomials (somewhat modified by plethystic\ntransformations), dubbed the double Jack polynomials. Here, in addition to\nspelling out these results, which were first obtained in the context of\nMacdonal superpolynomials, we provide a heuristic derivation of the Jack\nsuperpolynomial case by performing simple manipulations on the supersymmetric\neigen-operators, rendering them independent of the number of particles and of\nthe fermionic degree. In addition, we work out the expression of the\nHamiltonian which characterizes the double Jacks. This Hamiltonian, which\ndefines a new integrable system, involves not only the expected\nCalogero-Sutherland pieces but also combinations of the generators of an\nunderlying affine ${\\widehat{\\mathfrak {sl}}_2}$ algebra.\n"]}]

For any decision problem, there\nexists a span program that leads to an algorithm with optimal quantum query\ncomplexity, but finding such an algorithm is generally challenging.\n  We consider new ways of designing quantum algorithms using span programs. We\nshow how any span program that decides a problem $f$ can also be used to decide\n\"property testing\" versions of $f$, or more generally, approximate the span\nprogram witness size, a property of the input related to $f$. For example,\nusing our techniques, the span program for OR, which can be used to design an\noptimal algorithm for the OR function, can also be used to design optimal\nalgorithms for: threshold functions, in which we want to decide if the Hamming\nweight of a string is above a threshold or far below, given the promise that\none of these is true; and approximate counting, in which we want to estimate\nthe Hamming weight of the input. We achieve these results by relaxing the\nrequirement that 1-inputs hit some target exactly in the span program, which\ncould make design of span programs easier.\n  We also give an exposition of span program structure, which increases the\nunderstanding of this important model. One implication is alternative\nalgorithms for estimating the witness size when the phase gap of a certain\nunitary can be lower bounded.

One way to circumvent this impossibility consists in weakening its\ntermination property, requiring that a process terminates (decides) only if it\nexecutes alone during a long enough period. This is the well-known\nobstruction-freedom progress condition. Considering a system of $n$ {\\it\nanonymous asynchronous} processes, which communicate through atomic {\\it\nread/write registers only}, and where {\\it any number of processes may crash},\nthis paper addresses and solves the challenging open problem of designing an\nobstruction-free $k$-set agreement algorithm with $(n-k+1)$ atomic registers\nonly. From a shared memory cost point of view, this algorithm is the best\nalgorithm known so far, thereby establishing a new upper bound on the number of\nregisters needed to solve the problem (its gain is $(n-k)$ with respect to the\nprevious upper bound). The algorithm is then extended to address the repeated\nversion of $(n,k)$-set agreement. As it is optimal in the number of atomic\nread/write registers, this algorithm closes the gap on previously established\nlower/upper bounds for both the anonymous and non-anonymous versions of the\nrepeated $(n,k)$-set agreement problem. Finally, for $1 \\leq x\\leq k\n\\textless{} n$, a generalization suited to $x$-obstruction-freedom is also\ndescribed, which requires $(n-k+x)$ atomic registers only.\n"]}]

To deal effectively with this in weigh restrictions (WR) framework, we\nfirst precisely identify the two potential sources of its origin in the\nnon-radial DEA setting. If the firm under evaluation P is WR-efficient, the\nnon-full-dimensionality of its corresponding P-face-a face of minimum dimension\nthat contains P-is the unique source of origin (problem Type I). Otherwise, the\noccurrence of multiple WR-projections or, correspondingly, multiple P-faces\nbecomes the other additional source of origin (problem Type II). To the best of\nour knowledge, while problem Type I has been correctly addressed in the\nliterature, the simultaneous occurrences of problems Types I and II have not\neffectively been coped with. Motivated by this, we first show that problem Type\nII can be circumvented by using a P-face containing all the P-faces.
