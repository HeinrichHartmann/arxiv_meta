A distinguishing feature of wireless sensors is the need to perform\nboth source coding tasks, such as measurement and compression, and transmission\ntasks. It is known that the overall energy consumption for source coding is\ngenerally comparable to that of transmission, and that a joint design of the\ntwo classes of tasks can lead to relevant performance gains. Moreover, the\nefficiency of source coding in a sensor network can be potentially improved via\ndistributed techniques by leveraging the fact that signals measured by\ndifferent nodes are correlated.\n  In this paper, a data gathering protocol for multihop wireless sensor\nnetworks with energy harvesting capabilities is studied whereby the sources\nmeasured by the sensors are correlated. Both the energy consumptions of source\ncoding and transmission are modeled, and distributed source coding is assumed.\nThe problem of dynamically and jointly optimizing the source coding and\ntransmission strategies is formulated for time-varying channels and sources.\nThe problem consists in the minimization of a cost function of the distortions\nin the source reconstructions at the sink under queue stability constraints. By\nadopting perturbation-based Lyapunov techniques, a close-to-optimal online\nscheme is proposed that has an explicit and controllable trade-off between\noptimality gap and queue sizes. The role of side information available at the\nsink is also discussed under the assumption that acquiring the side information\nentails an energy cost. It is shown that the presence of side information can\nimprove the network performance both in terms of overall network cost function\nand queue sizes.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 5 figures"]}]

In each round\nan agent decides if it remains idle or if it wants to move to one of the\nadjacent nodes. Agents are subject to delay faults: if an agent incurs a fault\nin a given round, it remains in the current node, regardless of its decision.\nIf it planned to move and the fault happened, the agent is aware of it.

Recent studies in Naked Mole Rat (NMR) and long- lived sea\nurchin showed that the level of gene expression changes with age is lower than\nin other organisms. These phenotypic observations correlate well with\nexceptional endurance of NMR tissues to various genotoxic stresses. Therefore,\nthe lifelong transcriptional stability of an organism may be a key determinant\nof longevity. However, the exact relation between genetic network stability,\nstress-resistance and aging has not been defined. We analyze the stability of a\nsimple genetic- network model of a living organism under the influence of\nexternal and endogenous factors. We demonstrate that under most common\ncircumstances a gene network is inherently unstable and suffers from\nexponential accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.\nHowever, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective, the gene network\ncan stabilize so that gene damage remains constrained along with mortality of\nthe organism, which may then enjoy a remarkable degree of stability over very\nlong times. We clarify the relation between stress-resistance and aging and\nsuggest that stabilization of the genetic network may provide a mathematical\nexplanation of the Gompertz equation describing the relationship between age\nand mortality in many species, and of the apparently negligible senescence\nobserved in exceptionally long-lived animals. The model may support a range of\napplications, such as systematic searches for therapeutics to extend lifespan\nand healthspan.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures"]}]

The present study aims to fill\nthis gap by investigating the turbulent flow of a Newtonian fluid laden with\nsolid neutrally-buoyant spheres at relatively high volume fractions in a plane\nchannel. Direct Numerical Simulation are performed in the range of volume\nfractions Phi=0-0.2 with an Immersed Boundary Method used to account for the\ndispersed phase. The results show that the mean velocity profiles are\nsignificantly altered by the presence of a solid phase with a decrease of the\nvon Karman constant in the log-law. The overall drag is found to increase with\nthe volume fraction, more than one would expect just considering the increase\nof the system viscosity due to the presence of the particles. At the highest\nvolume fraction here investigated, Phi=0.2, the velocity fluctuation\nintensities and the Reynolds shear stress are found to decrease. The analysis\nof the mean momentum balance shows that the particle-induced stresses govern\nthe dynamics at high Phi and are the main responsible of the overall drag\nincrease.

It\nis predicted that such high accretion rates should give rise to massive,\nradiatively-driven winds. However, observational evidence of a wind, in the\nform of absorption or emission features, has remained elusive. As such, the\nreported detection of X-ray spectral residuals in XMM-Newton spectra of NGC\n5408 X-1, which could be related to absorption in a wind is potentially very\nexciting.

We demonstrate that the majority of the luminosity in these\nspectral features is emitted from a highly localised region close to the ULX,\nand appears point-like even with Chandra. It is therefore highly likely that\nthe spectral features are associated with the ULX itself, and little of the\nflux in this spectral component originates from spatially extended emission in\nthe host galaxy. This may be consistent with the suggestion of absorption in an\noptically thin phase of a super-Eddington wind.

We\npresent results of a state-of-the-art eddy-resolving global ocean model with a\nclosed Drake Passage, and compare with results of the same model at non-eddying\nresolution. An analysis of the pathways of heat by decomposing the meridional\nheat transport into eddy, horizontal, and overturning circulation components\nindicates that the model behavior on the large scale is qualitatively similar\nat both resolutions. Closing Drake Passage induces (i) sea surface warming\naround Antarctica due to changes in the horizontal circulation of the Southern\nOcean, (ii) the collapse of the overturning circulation related to North\nAtlantic Deep Water formation leading to surface cooling in the North Atlantic,\n(iii) significant equatorward eddy heat transport near Antarctica. However,\nquantitative details significantly depend on the chosen resolution. The warming\naround Antarctica is substantially larger for the non-eddying configuration\n(5.5{degree sign}C) than for the eddying configuration (2.5{degree sign}C).\nThis is a consequence of the subpolar mean flow which partitions differently\ninto gyres and circumpolar current at different resolutions.

The PHM is defined as a nonlocal function of two\nspatial variables and provides information about the origins, destinations, and\nconnections of charge fluctuations during an excitation process; it is\nparticularly valuable to analyze charge-transfer excitonic processes. In\ncontrast with the transition density matrix, the PHM has a statistical\ninterpretation involving joint probabilities of individual states and their\ntransitions, it satisfies several sum rules and exact conditions, and it is\neasier to read and interpret.

Aeolus retrieves three spots at the top-of-the-atmosphere\n(per observational wavelength) of these two brown dwarfs, with a surface\ncoverage of 21+-3% and 20.3+-1.5% respectively.
