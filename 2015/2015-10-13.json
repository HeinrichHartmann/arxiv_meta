Second, to outline Bayesian\napproaches to formulating and estimating copula models, and their advantages\nover alternative methods. Copulas covered include Archimedean, copulas\nconstructed by inversion, and vine copulas; along with their interpretation as\ntransformations. A number of parameterisations of a correlation matrix of a\nGaussian copula are considered, along with hierarchical priors that allow for\nBayesian selection and model averaging for each parameterisation.

The electronic spectral function for such a system\npredicts a narrow Kondo resonance close to Fermi energy below its Kondo\ntemperature 'TK'. The internal energy level structure of the localized magnetic\nmoment introduces sidebands near the Kondo resonance, each with its respective\nKondo temperature increasing as the sideband position moves towards higher\nbinding energies. Consequently, the temperature dependence of the resonance\nfeatures becomes weaker as we go towards higher binding energies.

Our\nmeasurements reveal a uniform temperature dependence for all the well screened\nCe4f photoemission features (4f1 final state), which are usually interpreted as\nresonance features, as we reduce the temperature suggesting that the resonance\ninterpretation for the 4f1 final state features is not appropriate. Instead,\nthe spectral evolution is explained simply by the temperature dependence of the\nstrength of the coupling between Ce4f and valence electrons, which remains\nuniform over the range of 4f1 final state features. As a possible explanation\nto the observed spectral evolution, we propose the phenomenon of collapse of\nthe Kondo singlet wave function upon photoelectron kinetic energy measurement,\nanalogous to the wave function collapse observed upon measurements performed on\nan entangled EPR (Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen) pair.

We investigate how gaps can affect the\ncomputed values of correlation dimension of the system, without using any\ninterpolation. For this we introduce gaps artificially in synthetic data\nderived from standard chaotic systems, like the R{\\\"o}ssler and Lorenz, with\nfrequency of occurrence and size of missing data drawn from two Gaussian\ndistributions. Then we study the changes in correlation dimension with change\nin the distributions of position and size of gaps. We find that for a\nconsiderable range of mean gap frequency and size, the value of correlation\ndimension is not significantly affected, indicating that in such specific\ncases, the calculated values can still be reliable and acceptable. Thus our\nstudy introduces a method of checking the reliability of computed correlation\ndimension values by calculating the distribution of gaps with respect to its\nsize and position.

On such a system, the evolution of the concentration of species\ninterferes with the measurement process, and creates a bias on the diffusion\ncoefficient determination that may lead to erroneous interpretations.\n  We show that a random permutation of the series of gradient strengths used\nduring the DOSY experiment allows to average out this bias. This approach, that\nwe name p-DOSY does not require changes in the the pulse sequences nor in the\nprocessing software, and restores completely the full accuracy of the measure.\nThis technique is demonstrated on the monitoring of the anomerization reaction\nof \\alpha- to \\beta-glucose.\n","Comment: Revised version - 15 pages, 8 figures program archived at\n  10.5281/zenodo.19261"]}]

Here we study how people resolve this moral conflict. What does telling\na white lie signal about a person's pro-social tendencies? To answer this\nquestion, we conducted a two-stage 2x2 experiment. In the first stage, we used\na Deception Game to measure aversion to telling a Pareto white lie (i.e., a lie\nthat helps both the liar and the listener), and aversion to telling an\naltruistic white lie (i.e., a lie that helps the listener at the expense of the\nliar). In the second stage we measured altruistic tendencies using a Dictator\nGame and cooperative tendencies using a Prisoner's dilemma. We found three\nmajor results: (i) both altruism and cooperation are positively correlated with\naversion to telling a Pareto white lie; (ii) both altruism and cooperation are\nnegatively correlated with aversion to telling an altruistic white lie; (iii)\nmen are more likely than women to tell an altruistic white lie, but not to tell\na Pareto white lie. Our results shed light on the moral conflit between\npro-sociality and truth-telling.

In the case of BHs found in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) the\nobserved values are in agreement with some theoretical predictions based on\nbinary stellar evolution. However, using the same evolutionary models, the\ncalculated spins of BHs in high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) fall short compared\nto the observations. A possible solution to this conundrum is the accretion of\nhigh-specific-angular-momentum material after the formation of the BH, although\nthis requires accretion above the Eddington limit. Another suggestion is that\nthe observed high values of the BHs spin could be the result of an asymmetry\nduring Core Collapse (CC). The only available energy to spin up the compact\nobject during CC is its binding energy. A way to convert it to rotational\nkinetic energy is by using a Standing Accretion Shock Instability (SASI), which\ncan develop during CC and push angular momentum into the central compact object\nthrough a spiral mode ($m = 1$). Here we study the CC-SASI scenario and\ndiscuss, in the case of LMXBs and HMXBs, the limits for the spin of a\nstellar-mass BHs. Our results predict a strong dichotomy in the maximum spin of\nlow-mass compact objects and massive BHs found in HMXBs. The maximum spin value\n($|a_\\star|$) for a compact object near the mass boundary between BHs and NSs\nis found to be somewhere between 0.27 and 0.38, depending on whether secular or\ndynamical instabilities limit the efficiency of the spin up process. For more\nmassive BHs, such as those found in HMXBs, the natal spin is substantially\nsmaller and for $M_{\\rm BH}\\!>\\!8~M_\\odot$ spin is limited to values\n$|a_\\star|\\!\\lesssim\\!0.05$. Therefore we conclude that the observed high spins\nof BHs in HMXBs cannot be the result of a CC-SASI spin up.\n","Comment: Accepted to New Astronomy; 26 pages, 2 figures, 1 table"]}]

The main new result of the paper is that\nthis convergence is strong in the case of Dirichlet boundary condition. Indeed,\nwe prove that the acoustic waves are damped immediately, namely they are damped\nin a boundary layer in time. This damping is due to the presence of viscous and\nkinetic boundary layers in space. As a consequence, we also justify the first\ncorrection to the infinitesimal Maxwellian that one obtains from the\nChapman-Enskog expansion with Navier-Stokes scaling.\n  This extends the work of Golse and Saint-Raymond \\cite{Go-Sai04, Go-Sai05}\nand Levermore and Masmoudi \\cite{LM} to the case of a bounded domain.

Given the\ngeometry of the lampshade and a target grayscale image, our method computes a\ndistribution of tiny holes over the shell, such that the combined footprints of\nthe light emanating through the holes form the target image on a nearby diffuse\nsurface. Our objective is to approximate the continuous tones and the spatial\ndetail of the target image, to the extent possible within the constraints of\nthe fabrication process.\n  To ensure structural integrity, there are lower bounds on the thickness of\nthe shell, the radii of the holes, and the minimal distances between adjacent\nholes. Thus, the holes are realized as thin tubes distributed over the\nlampshade surface. The amount of light passing through a single tube may be\ncontrolled by the tube's radius and by its direction (tilt angle). The core of\nour technique thus consists of determining a suitable configuration of the\ntubes: their distribution across the relevant portion of the lampshade, as well\nas the parameters (radius, tilt angle) of each tube. This is achieved by\ncomputing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined\ndensity function, and embedding a tube inside the maximal inscribed circle of\neach tessellation cell.

We concluded\nthat using GECODE for the concurrency control avoids the need of having threads\nand synchronizing them, leading to a simple and efficient implementation of CCP\nand NTCC. We also noticed that the time units in NTCC interpreter do not\nrepresent discrete time units, because when we simulate the NTCC specifications\nin the interpreter, the time units have different durations. In the future, we\npropose forcing the duration of each time unit to a fix time, that way we would\nbe able to reason about NTCC time units as we do with discrete time units.\n","Comment: 55 pages"]}]

We demonstrate that in this setup prior network\nerror-correcting schemes can be arbitrarily far from achieving the optimal\nnetwork throughput. A new transform metric for errors under the considered\nmodel is proposed. Using this metric, we replicate many of the classical\nresults from coding theory. Specifically, we prove new Hamming-type,\nPlotkin-type, and Elias-Bassalygo-type upper bounds on the network capacity. A\ncommensurate lower bound is shown based on Gilbert-Varshamov-type codes for\nerror-correction. The GV codes used to attain the lower bound can be\nnon-coherent, that is, they do not require prior knowledge of the network\ntopology.

There are three types of senile cataract:\ncortical cataract, nuclear cataract, and posterior/anterior sub-capsular\ncataract. The cataract that develops in most old people is cortical cataract.\nThe clouding change in senile cortical cataract begins from the edge of the\nlens and develops progressively to lens centre. The pathology of a clouding\nchange in cortical cataract is characterized by disruption of some lens fibers,\nswelling of some other fibers, and deposition of water between fibers. Based on\nthe property of a lens fiber, we propose here a hypothesis on the mechanism of\ndevelopment of senile cortical cataract. I. Cortical cataract is triggered by\nthe disruption of a cortical lens fiber as a result of an injury. The disrupted\nfiber will release water and crystallin proteins. II. The neighbor fibers can\nabsorb this water due to the high intracellular osmotic pressure (IOP) and\nbecome swollen. Swelling makes a fiber be stiff and have increased risk to\ndisrupt when it is curved during the accommodations of the lens. These fibers\nwill release water again when they disrupt, and the water will make more local\nfibers swelling. In this way, the local fibers become swollen and then disrupt\nsuccessively. III. The successive swellings and disruptions of local fibers\nresult in the enlargement of a clouding change in lens. Since the fibers on the\nouter part of lens cortex have higher risk to be injured than that in the inner\npart, a clouding change starts from the edge of the lens. Conclusion: in our\nview, the progressive development of senile cortical cataract is a result of\nsuccessive swellings and disruptions of local lens fibers, which is driven by\nthe high IOP in lens fibers.\n","Comment: 8 pages, figures"]}]

We say that a sketch is \\emph{compact} if its size is\nbounded by a polynomial function of the length of the dynamic data,\n(essentially) independent of the size of the static part.\n  A graph optimization problem $P$ in this model is defined as follows. The\ninput is a graph $G(V,E)$ and a set $T \\subseteq V$ of $k$ terminals; the edges\nbetween the terminals are the dynamic part and the other edges in $G$ are the\nstatic part. The goal is to summarize the graph $G$ into a compact sketch (of\nsize poly$(k)$) such that given any set $Q$ of edges between the terminals, one\ncan answer the problem $P$ for the graph obtained by inserting all edges in $Q$\nto $G$, using only the sketch.\n  We study the fundamental problem of computing a maximum matching and prove\ntight bounds on the sketch size.

We further show that in the case when homogeneity corresponds to the\nOnsager-critical state, the anomalous energy flux at the singularity vanishes,\nwhich is suggestive of absence of extreme $0$-dimensional intermittencies in\ndissipative flows.\n","Comment: 18 pages"]}]

Each user wants to exchange messages with all the other users via\nthe relay. A transmission strategy is proposed for this channel. The proposed\nstrategy is based on two steps: channel diagonalization and cyclic\ncommunication. The channel diagonalization is applied by using zero-forcing\nbeam-forming. After channel diagonalization, the channel is decomposed into\nparallel sub-channels. Cyclic communication is then applied, where signal-space\nalignment for network-coding is used over each sub-channel. The proposed\nstrategy achieves the optimal DoF region of the channel if $N\\leq M$. To prove\nthis, a new degrees-of-freedom outer bound is derived. As a by-product, we\nconclude that the MIMO Y-channel is not separable, i.e., independent coding on\nseparate sub-channels is not enough, and one has to code jointly over several\nsub-channels.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 6 figures, to appear in IEEE Trans. on Info.

We formulate the basic concepts of the VDA\napproach and introduce the pion transverse momentum distribution amplitude\n(TMDA) which plays, in a covariant Lagrangian formulation, a role similar to\nthat of the pion wave function in the 3-dimensional Hamiltonian light-front\napproach. We propose simple factorized models for soft TMDAs, and use them to\ndescribe existing data on the pion transition form factor, thus fixing the\nscale determining the size of the transverse-momentum effects. Finally, we\napply the VDA approach to the one-gluon exchange contribution for the pion\nelectromagnetic form factor. We observe a very late $Q^2 \\gtrsim 20$ GeV$^2$\nonset of transition to the asymptotic pQCD predictions and show that in the\n$Q^2 \\lesssim 10$ GeV$^2$ region there is essentially no sensitivity to the\nshape of the pion distribution amplitude.
