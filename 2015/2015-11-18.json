By solving coupled equations for magnetic energy\nand magnetic helicity in a system initiated with isotropic turbulence and an\narbitrarily helical large scale field, we quantify the decay rate of the latter\nfor a bounded or periodic system. The energy associated with the non-helical\nmagnetic field rapidly decays by turbulent diffusion, but the decay rate of the\nhelical component depends on whether the ratio of its magnetic energy to the\nturbulent kinetic energy exceeds a critical value given by M_{1,c}\n=(k_1/k_2)^2, where k_1 and k_2 are the wave numbers of the large and forcing\nscales. Turbulently diffusing helical fields to small scales while conserving\nmagnetic helicity requires a rapid increase in total magnetic energy. As such,\nonly when the helical fields are sub-critical can they so diffuse. When\nsuper-critical, the large scale helical field decays slowly, at a rate\ndetermined by microphysical dissipation even when macroscopic turbulence is\npresent. Amplification of small scale magnetic helicity abates the turbulent\ndiffusion. Two implications are that: (1) Standard arguments supporting the\nneed for in situ large scale dynamos based on the otherwise rapid turbulent\ndiffusion of large scale fields require re-thinking since only the non-helical\nfield is so diffused in a closed system. Boundary terms could however provide\npotential pathways for rapid change of the large scale helical field.

Observing that neither Bayesian credible intervals nor standard\nbootstrap confidence intervals succeed in achieving good frequentist coverage\nin this problem due to the inherent bias of the regularized point estimate, we\nintroduce an iteratively bias-corrected bootstrap technique for constructing\nimproved confidence intervals.

The\nnorthern part of the front appears the sharpest, with a width smaller than 2.5\nkpc (1.5 Coulomb mean free paths; at 99 per cent confidence).

This component, often associated with the GRB\njet's photosphere, is usually subdominant compared to a much stronger\nnon-thermal one. The prompt emission of Fermi GRB 131014A provides a unique\nopportunity to study this thermal-like component. Indeed, the thermal emission\nin GRB 131014A is much more intense than in other GRBs and a pure thermal\nepisode is observed during the initial 0.16 s. The thermal-like component cools\nmonotonically during the first second while the non-thermal emission kicks off.\nThe intensity of the non-thermal component progressively increases until being\nenergetically dominant at late time. This is a perfect scenario to disentangle\nthe thermal component from the non-thermal one. A low-energy spectral index of\n+0.6 better fit the thermal component than the typical index value +1\ncorresponding to a pure Planck function. The non-thermal component is\nadequately fitted with a Band function whose low and high energy power law\nindices are ~-0.7 and <~-3, respectively; this is also statistically equivalent\nto a cutoff power law with a ~-0.7 index. This is in agreement with our\nprevious results. Finally, a strong correlation is observed between the\ntime-resolved luminosity of the non-thermal component, L$_i^{nTh}$, and its\ncorresponding rest frame spectral peak energy, E$_{peak,i}^{rest,nTh}$, with a\nslope similar to the one reported in our previous articles. Assuming this\nrelation to be universal for all GRBs we estimate a redshift of ~1.55 for GRB\n131014A that is a typical value for long GRBs. These observational results are\nconsistent with the models in which the non-thermal emission is produced well\nabove the GRB jet photosphere but they may also be compatible with other\nscenarios (e.g., dissipative photosphere) that are not discussed in this\narticle.\n","Comment: 13 pages of article including 9 figures + 13 pages of Appendix (1\n  figure and 1 table), Submitted to ApJ (Received July 23, 2015)"]}]

A special feature of this analysis is that\nthe thermodynamic energy of a quantum system is shown to be a continuous\nvariable, rather than being associated with discrete energy eigenvalues.\nCalculations of the entropy as a function of energy can be carried out with a\nLegendre transform of thermodynamic potentials obtained from a canonical\nensemble. The resultant expressions for the entropy are also able to describe\nequilibrium between quantum systems having incommensurate energy-level\nspacings. This definition of entropy preserves all required thermodynamic\nproperties, including satisfaction of all postulates and laws of\nthermodynamics. It also demonstrates the consistency of the concept of negative\ntemperature with the principles of thermodynamics.\n"]}]

We\nperform three-dimensional (3D), time-dependent, resistive, compressible MHD\nsimulations using the Lare3D code. Results. We find that there are considerable\ndifferences in the dynamics of the emergence of a magnetic flux tube when\n{\\lambda} is varied. In the solar interior, for larger values of {\\lambda}, the\nrising magnetic field emerges faster and expands more due to its lower magnetic\ntension. As a result, its field strength decreases and its emergence above the\nphotosphere occurs later than in the smaller {\\lambda} case. However, in both\ncases, the emerging field at the photosphere becomes unstable in two places,\nforming two magnetic bipoles that interact dynamically during the evolution of\nthe system. Most of the dynamic phenomena occur at the current layer, which is\nformed at the interface between the interacting bipoles. We find the formation\nand ejection of plasmoids, the onset of successive jets from the interface, and\nthe impulsive heating of the plasma in the solar atmosphere. We discuss the\ntriggering mechanism of the jets and the atmospheric response to the emergence\nof magnetic flux in the two cases.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 15 figures"]}]

Their relationship can be approximately fitted by power laws,\nwhich is consistent with the results obtained from impact simulations of\nSNe~Ia. However, we find that the impact velocity is sensitive to the momentum\nprofile of the outer SN ejecta and, in fact, may decrease with increasing\nejecta mass, depending on the modeling of the ejecta. Because most companions\nto Ib/c CCSNe are in their MS phase at the moment of the explosion, combined\nwith the strongly decaying impact effects with increasing binary separation, we\nargue that the majority of these SNe lead to inefficient mass stripping and\nshock heating of the companion star following the impact of the ejecta. Our\nsimulations show that the impact effects of Ib/c SN ejecta on the structure of\nMS companions, and thus their long-term post-explosion evolution, is in general\nnot dramatic.

Fits to the model constrain the median\nextinction, the width of the extinction distribution, and the fraction of\nreddened stars. The resulting extinction map has >4 times better resolution\nthan maps of dust emission, while providing a more direct measurement of the\ndust column. There is superb morphological agreement between the new map and\nmaps of the extinction inferred from dust emission by Draine et al. 2014.\nHowever, the widely-used Draine & Li (2007) dust models overpredict the\nobserved extinction by a factor of ~2.5, suggesting that M31's true dust mass\nis lower and that dust grains are significantly more emissive than assumed in\nDraine et al. (2014). The discrepancy we identify is consistent with similar\nfindings in the Milky Way by the Planck Collaboration (2015), but has a more\ncomplex dependence on parameters from the Draine & Li (2007) dust models. We\nalso show that the discrepancy with the Draine et al. (2014) map is lowest\nwhere the interstellar radiation field has a harder spectrum than average. We\ndiscuss possible improvements to the CMD dust mapping technique, and explore\nfurther applications.\n","Comment: 52 pages in ApJ format including 39 figures.

In all cases, tilde-shaped signatures are found\nwhere the positive and negative shifts (at PA 0deg) are associated with blue\nand weaker red components of the lines. The shifts can be modelled with a\nbright blob 70 mas to 210 mas south of the star with a flux of several percent\nof the photospheric flux.

Previous work on software\narchitecture reuse with multiple platforms either requires platform-specific\nhandcrafting or the effort of explicit platform models. We present an automated\napproach to transform platform-independent, logical software architectures into\narchitectures with platform-specific components. This approach introduces\nabstract components to the platform-independent architecture and refines the se\nwith components specific to the target platform prior to code generation.\nConsequently, a single logical software architecture model can be reused with\nmultiple target platforms, which increases architecture maturity and reduces\nthe maintenance effort of multiple similar software architectures.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 4 figures, 2 listings 2nd International Workshop on\n  Model-Driven Engineering for Component-Based Software Systems (ModComp)"]}]

A study using time-resolved\noptical simulations can demonstrate and quantify how light is coupled and\npropagation in DIDs structure when observed across the gratings (in collinear\nincidence). The leaky resonant modes of the RWG are playing a significant role\nin the appearance of DIDs in collinear incidence, which has practical impacts\non the engineering of such security elements. From the learning of such\nnon-local light interactions in DIDs, new optically variable effects can be\ndesigned and produced by using light transport in RWG. As an example,\nmulti-frequency RWGs can be designed to couple light for different colors and\npolarizations and to outcouple them away from the specular configuration\ntypical to the Zero Order Devices. As a further step, we present new structures\nable to couple light in the substrates or in selected layers of security\ndocuments or labels, embling waveguiding light in these layers. These optical\ncouplers enable selective light transport at a macroscopic scale using total\ninternal reflection in the volume of the substrates, while being compatible\nwith current roll-to-roll methods.\n"]}]
