Conditional power of a\ncomponent of the sparse vector is defined as the energy conditioned on the\ncomponent being nonzero. Analysis of a simplified version of orthogonal\nmatching pursuit (OMP) called sequential OMP (SequOMP) demonstrates the\nimportance of knowledge of the rankings of conditional powers. When the simple\nSequOMP algorithm is applied to components in nonincreasing order of\nconditional power, the detrimental effect of dynamic range on thresholding\nperformance is eliminated. Furthermore, under the most favorable conditional\npowers, the performance of SequOMP approaches maximum likelihood performance at\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio.\n","Comment: 13 pages"]}]

In the present work, we report results from\nMonte Carlo simulations of site-diluted microscopic dipolar spin ice models\n(DSIM) that account quantitatively for the experimental specific heat\nmeasurements, and thus also for the residual entropy, as a function of\ndilution, for both Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O7. The main features of the dilution\nphysics displayed by the magnetic specific heat data are quantitatively\ncaptured by the diluted DSIM up to, and including, 85% of the magnetic ions\ndiluted (x=1.7). The previously reported departures in the residual entropy\nbetween Dy2Ti2O7 versus Ho2Ti2O7, as well as with a site-dilution variant of\nPauling's approximation, are thus rationalized through the site-diluted DSIM.\nFor 90% (x=1.8) and 95% (x=1.9) of the magnetic ions diluted, we find a\nsignificant discrepancy between the experimental and Monte Carlo specific heat\nresults. We discuss some possible reasons for this disagreement.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures"]}]

This problem of discrete optimisation is formulated as an\ninteger program (IP). We describe the various steps we have taken to allow\nefficient solving of this IP. These are (i) efficient search for cutting\nplanes, (ii) a fast greedy algorithm to find high-scoring (perhaps not optimal)\nBNs and (iii) tightening the linear relaxation of the IP. After relating this\nBN learning problem to set covering and the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack\nproblem, we present our empirical results.

Our method\ndetermines in a quantitative and halo-independent way whether the experiments\npoint towards a consistent dark matter signal and identifies the best-fit dark\nmatter parameters. To achieve true halo independence, we apply a recently\ndeveloped method based on finding the velocity distribution that best describes\na given set of data. For a quantitative global analysis we construct a\nlikelihood function suitable for small numbers of events, which allows us to\ndetermine the best-fit particle physics properties of dark matter considering\nall experiments simultaneously. Based on this likelihood function we propose a\nnew test statistic that quantifies how well the proposed model fits the data\nand how large the tension between different direct detection experiments is. We\nperform Monte Carlo simulations in order to determine the probability\ndistribution function of this test statistic and to calculate the p-value for\nboth the dark matter hypothesis and the background-only hypothesis.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 14 figures. v2: matches published version"]}]

Acoustic technologies frequently\ndevelop in tandem with optics, using shared concepts such as waveguiding and\nmetamedia. It is thus noteworthy that an entirely novel class of\nelectromagnetic waves, known as topological edge states, has recently been\ndemonstrated. These are inspired by the electronic edge states occurring in\ntopological insulators, and possess a striking and technologically promising\nproperty: the ability to travel in a single direction along a surface without\nbackscattering, regardless of the existence of defects or disorder. Here, we\ndevelop an analogous theory of topological fluid acoustics, and propose a\nscheme for realizing topological edge states in an acoustic structure\ncontaining circulating fluids. The phenomenon of disorder-free one-way sound\npropagation, which does not occur in ordinary acoustic devices, may have novel\napplications for acoustic isolators, modulators, and transducers.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures"]}]

It is hypothesized that the\nrunaway electron beam is formed in the central plasma region confined by an\nintact magnetic surface due to the acceleration of electrons by the inductive\ntoroidal electric field. In the case of plasmas with the safety factor $q(0)<1$\nthe most stable runaway electron beams are formed by the intact magnetic\nsurface located between the magnetic surface $q=1$ and the closest low--order\nrational surface $q=m/n>1$ ($q=5/4$, $q=4/3$, ...).

The runaway electron beam current is modeled\nas a sum of toroidally symmetric part and a small amplitude helical current\nwith a predominant $m/n=1/1$ component.

Such a stochastic layer for high--energy\nrunaway electrons is formed in the presence of the $m/n=1/1$ MHD mode. It has a\nmixed topological structure with a stochastic region open to wall. The effect\nof external resonant magnetic perturbations on runaway electron loss is\ndiscussed.

In MC CF users provide the rating on multiple aspects\nof an item in new dimensions,thereby increasing the size of rating matrix,\nsparsity and scalability problem. Appropriate dimensionality reduction\ntechniques are thus needed to take care of these challenges to reduce the\ndimension of user item rating matrix to improve the prediction accuracy and\nefficiency of CF recommender system.

Behaving as microRNA-sponges, distinct RNA species may compete\nfor binding to microRNAs and coregulate each other in a dose-dependent manner.\nAlthough previous studies in cell populations showed competition in vitro, the\ndetailed dynamical aspects of this process, most importantly in physiological\nconditions, remains unclear. We address this point by monitoring protein\nexpression of two targets of a common miRNA with quantitative single-cell\nmeasurements. In agreement with a detailed stochastic model of molecular\ntitration, we observed that: (i) crosstalk between targets is possible only in\nparticular stoichiometric conditions, (ii) a trade-off on the number of\nmicroRNA regulatory elements may induce the coexistence of two distinct cell\npopulations, (iii) strong inter-targets correlations can be observed. This\nphenomenology is compatible with a small amount of mRNA target molecules per\ncell of the order of 10-100.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 9 pdf figures, supplementary information included"]}]

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group\ndefined over $k$. We prove that some Frobenius pull back of a principal\n$G$-bundle admits the canonical reduction $E_P$ such that its extension by\n$P\\to P/R_u(P)$ is strongly semistable.\n  Then we show that there is only a small difference between semistability of a\nprincipal $G$-bundle and semistability of its Frobenius pull back. This and the\nboundedness of the family of semistable torsion free sheaves imply the\nboundedness of semistable principal $G$-bundles.\n","Comment: 23 pages; The final version of this article will be published in the\n  Duke Mathematical Journal, published by Duke University Press"]}]
