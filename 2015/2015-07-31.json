The\nattribution of about 80 transitions of up to fifth order Raman processes are\nproposed in the low temperature(95K)resonant Raman spectrum measured with the\nexcitation energy of 1.96 eV,which is slightly shifted from the A exciton.

To manage the amount of energy sold to the\nelectricity market, a novel control scheme is developed based on discrete-time\nmodel predictive control (MPC) to ensure the optimal operation of the BESS in\nthe presence of practical constraints. The control scheme follows a decision\npolicy to sell more energy at peak demand times and store it at off-peaks in\ncompliance with the Australian National Electricity Market rules. The\nperformance of the control system is assessed under different scenarios using\nactual wind farm and electricity price data in simulation environment. The\nsecond part considers the control of overhead crane systems for automatic\noperation. To achieve high-speed load transportation with high-precision and\nminimum load swings, a new modeling approach is developed based on independent\njoint control strategy which considers actuators as the main plant. The\nnonlinearities of overhead crane dynamics are treated as disturbances acting on\neach actuator. The resulting model enables us to estimate the unknown\nparameters of the system including coulomb friction constants. A novel load\nswing control is also designed based on passivity-based control to suppress\nload swings. Two discrete-time controllers are then developed based on MPC and\nstate feedback control to track reference trajectories along with a feedforward\ncontrol to compensate for disturbances using computed torque control and a\nnovel disturbance observer.

Partially linked to its\nnumerous applications in mechanism design, substantial interest arose also in\nthe study of nonlinear versions of MSP, with a focus on the submodular matroid\nsecretary problem (SMSP). So far, O(1)-competitive algorithms have been\nobtained for SMSP over some basic matroid classes. This created some hope that,\nanalogously to the matroid secretary conjecture, one may even obtain\nO(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over any matroid. However, up to now, most\nquestions related to SMSP remained open, including whether SMSP may be\nsubstantially more difficult than MSP; and more generally, to what extend MSP\nand SMSP are related.\n  Our goal is to address these points by presenting general black-box\nreductions from SMSP to MSP. In particular, we show that any O(1)-competitive\nalgorithm for MSP, even restricted to a particular matroid class, can be\ntransformed in a black-box way to an O(1)-competitive algorithm for SMSP over\nthe same matroid class. This implies that the matroid secretary conjecture is\nequivalent to the same conjecture for SMSP. Hence, in this sense SMSP is not\nharder than MSP. Also, to find O(1)-competitive algorithms for SMSP over a\nparticular matroid class, it suffices to consider MSP over the same matroid\nclass. Using our reductions we obtain many first and improved O(1)-competitive\nalgorithms for SMSP over various matroid classes by leveraging known algorithms\nfor MSP. Moreover, our reductions imply an O(loglog(rank))-competitive\nalgorithm for SMSP, thus, matching the currently best asymptotic algorithm for\nMSP, and substantially improving on the previously best\nO(log(rank))-competitive algorithm for SMSP.\n"]}]

In bipartite lattices, e.g., the square lattice, the ground state\ncan be two types of phases: ferromagnetic-like (FM) and antiferromagnetic-like\n(AFM) phases.

Motivated by the prosperity of\nmultilayer approach in social, transport or trade systems, we propose the\nintroduction of multilayer networks for language. The multilayer network of\nlanguage is a unified framework for modeling linguistic subsystems and their\nstructural properties enabling the exploration of their mutual interactions.\nVarious aspects of natural language systems can be represented as complex\nnetworks, whose vertices depict linguistic units, while links model their\nrelations. The multilayer network of language is defined by three aspects: the\nnetwork construction principle, the linguistic subsystem and the language of\ninterest. More precisely, we construct a word-level (syntax, co-occurrence and\nits shuffled counterpart) and a subword level (syllables and graphemes) network\nlayers, from five variations of original text (in the modeled language). The\nobtained results suggest that there are substantial differences between the\nnetworks structures of different language subsystems, which are hidden during\nthe exploration of an isolated layer. The word-level layers share structural\nproperties regardless of the language (e.g. Croatian or English), while the\nsyllabic subword level expresses more language dependent structural properties.\nThe preserved weighted overlap quantifies the similarity of word-level layers\nin weighted and directed networks. Moreover, the analysis of motifs reveals a\nclose topological structure of the syntactic and syllabic layers for both\nlanguages. The findings corroborate that the multilayer network framework is a\npowerful, consistent and systematic approach to model several linguistic\nsubsystems simultaneously and hence to provide a more unified view on language.\n"]}]

In fact based on their standard error, the joint modelling provides\nmore accurate estimates of the heritability over the univariate modelling.\nMoreover, our Bayesian approach provides slightly higher estimates of\nheritability compared to the maximum likelihood method. On the other hand,\nalthough our method performs less well in phenotype prediction, we note that an\ninitial imputation step relatively increases the prediction accuracy.\n"]}]

As inhomogeneous portfolios, we consider\ntwo cases. In the first case, we treat a portfolio whose assets have uniform\ndefault correlation and non-uniform default probabilities.

We study the\nmaximum values of the inter-sector default correlation. Our generalization\nmethod can be applied to any correlated binomial default distribution model\nwhich has explicit relations to the conditional default probabilities or\nconditional default correlations, e.g. Credit Risk${}^{+}$, implied default\ndistributions.
