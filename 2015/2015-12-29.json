However, some radio relics have\nharder spectra than the prediction of the standard DSA model.

No evidences of\nsignificant spatial variations of abundances were found within our\nuncertainties. However, our findings show a slight anticorrelation between gas\nmetallicity and star-formation rate at spaxel scales, in the sense that high\nstar-formation is found in regions of low-metallicity, but the scatter in this\nrelation indicates that the metals are almost fully diluted. Our observations\nshow the presence of extended H$\\alpha$ emission in the stellar tail of the\ngalaxy. We estimated that the mass of the ionized gas in the tail\nM(HII)$_{tail} \\sim$1.7$\\times$10$^5$ M$_{\\odot}$ corresponds with $\\sim$ 24\nper cent of the total mass of the ionized gas in the galaxy. We found that the\nH$\\alpha$ velocity dispersion of the main body and the tail of the galaxy are\ncomparable with the one found in the neutral gas by previous studies. This\nsuggests that the ionized gas still retains the kinematic memory of its\nparental cloud and likely a common origin. Finally, we suggest that the\ninfall/accretion of cold gas from the outskirts of the galaxy and/or minor\nmerger/interaction may have produced the almost flat abundance gradient and the\ncometary morphology in Tol 65.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 12 figures, 5 tables; accepted for publication in MNRAS.\n  Replaced to match published version"]}]

We have shown the formation of an ion-wake channel behind\na blow-out electron bubble-wake. Here we explore positron acceleration in the\nover-dense regime comparing an optimal hollow-plasma channel to the ion-wake\nchannel. The condition for optimal hollow-channel radius is also compared.

Moreover, we obtain $O(m^{1+o(1)}\\log W)$ time for the weighted case,\nwhere the edge weights are integers from $1$ to $W$.\n  In contrast to the previous results which rely on maintaining a sparse\nemulator, our algorithm relies on maintaining a so-called sparse $(h,\n\\epsilon)$-hop set introduced by Cohen [JACM 2000] in the PRAM literature. An\n$(h, \\epsilon)$-hop set of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a set $F$ of weighted edges\nsuch that the distance between any pair of nodes in $G$ can be\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximated by their $h$-hop distance (given by a path\ncontaining at most $h$ edges) on $G'=(V, E\\cup F)$. Our algorithm can maintain\nan $(n^{o(1)}, \\epsilon)$-hop set of near-linear size in near-linear time under\nedge deletions. It is the first of its kind to the best of our knowledge. To\nmaintain approximate distances using this hop set, we extend the monotone\nEven-Shiloach tree of Henzinger et al. [FOCS 2013] and combine it with the\nbounded-hop SSSP technique of Bernstein [FOCS 2009, STOC 2013] and M\\k{a}dry\n[STOC 2010].\n","Comment: A preliminary version of this paper was presented at the 55th IEEE\n  Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2014)"]}]

We firstly\ndemonstrate non-perturbative gravitino mass generation via this mechanism in\nflat spacetime, and from this derive the condensate mode wavefunction\nrenormalisation. By then calculating the full canonically normalised one-loop\neffective potential for the condensate mode about a de Sitter background, we\ndemonstrate that, contrary to claims in the literature, this process may both\noccur and function in a phenomenologically viable manner. In particular, we\nfind that outside of certain unfortunate gauge choices, the stability of the\ncondensate is intimately tied via gravitational degrees of freedom to the sign\nof the tree-level cosmological constant. Furthermore, we find that the energy\ndensity liberated may provide the necessary inflation of the early universe via\nan effective scalar degree of freedom, provided by the condensate, acting as\nthe inflaton. However, in so doing we find that simultaneously\nphenomenologically viable inflation and supersymmetry breaking via this\napproach are mutually incompatible in the simplest supergravity settings. As\nthis mechanism takes place in the gravitational sector, relying on the\nubiquitous gravitino torsion terms, we argue that it can also enjoy a certain\nuniversality in the context of supergravity and string theories, in that it\ndoes not rely on specific or arbitrary choices of potential and/or matter\ncontent. This then allows straightforward transplantation of these results into\nother settings.

To address this challenge, we introduce a new\natoms-in-materials method with the following nine properties: (1) exactly one\nelectron distribution is assigned to each atom, (2) core electrons are assigned\nto the correct host atom, (3) NACs are formally independent of the basis set\ntype because they are functionals of the total electron distribution, (4) the\nassigned atomic electron distributions give an efficiently converging\npolyatomic multipole expansion, (5) the assigned NACs usually follow Pauling\nscale electronegativity trends, (6) NACs for a particular element have good\ntransferability among different conformations that are equivalently bonded, (7)\nthe assigned NACs are chemically consistent with the assigned atomic spin\nmoments, (8) the method has predictably rapid and robust convergence to a\nunique solution, and (9) the computational cost of charge partitioning scales\nlinearly with increasing system size. Across a broad range of material types,\nthe DDEC6 NACs reproduced electron transfer trends, core electron binding\nenergy shift trends, and electrostatic potentials across multiple system\nconformations with excellent accuracy compared to other charge assignment\nmethods.

Tikhonov regularization, or ridge regression, is a popular approach\nto address this issue. We reveal here a formal analogy between ridge regression\nand statistical mechanics, where the objective function is comparable to a free\nenergy and the ridge parameter plays the role of temperature. This analogy\nsuggests two new criteria to select a suitable ridge parameter: the\nspecific-heat (Cv) and the maximum penalty (MP) fits. We apply these methods to\nthe calibration of the force constant in elastic network models (ENM). This key\nparameter determines the amplitude of the predicted atomic fluctuations, and is\ncommonly obtained by fitting crystallographic B-factors. However, rigid-body\nmotions are often partially neglected in such fits, even though their\nimportance has been repeatedly stressed. Considering the full set of rigid-body\nand internal degrees of freedom bears significant risks of overfitting, due to\nstrong correlations between explanatory variables, and requires thus careful\nregularization. Using simulated data, we show that ridge regression with the Cv\nor MP criterion markedly reduces the error of the estimated force constant, its\nacross-protein variation, and the number of proteins with unphysical values of\nthe fit parameters, in comparison with popular regularization schemes such as\ngeneralized cross-validation. When applied to protein crystals, the new methods\nprovide a more robust calibration of ENM force constants, even though\nrigid-body motions account on average for more than 80% of the amplitude of\nB-factors. While MP emerges as the optimal choice for fitting crystallographic\nB-factors, the Cv fit is more robust to the nature of the data, and is thus an\ninteresting candidate for other applications.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 9 figures, Supp. Mat"]}]

The\napproach inspired from Cognitive Packet Network protocol, uses Random Neural\nNetworks with Reinforcement Learning based on the massive data that is\ncollected, to select intermediate overlay hops resulting in significantly\nbetter QoS than IP itself. The routing scheme is illustrated on a $20$-node\nintercontinental overlay network that collects close to $2\\times 10^6$\nmeasurements per week, and makes scalable distributed routing decisions.\nExperimental results show that this approach improves QoS significantly and\nefficiently in a scalable manner.\n","Comment: 9 pages"]}]

One consequence of our proof is that if G,H are independent graphs\nwhere G follows the random regular law, then with high probability the graphs\nare non-isomorphic; and this can be efficiently certified by testing the\nR-neighborhood list of H against the R-neighborhood of a single adversarially\nchosen vertex of G.\n"]}]

Being a paper scientist the author\nrefers to the sheet of paper which is a stochastic fibrous set whose porous\ntexture can be considered as an archetype for many natural or artificial human\nstructures. The paper properties are correlated with its texture by taking\naccount the effect of chance occurring during its manufacturing process. The\ntheoretical developments, the formalism and the application methods presented\nin this study have a general significance beyond the only paper material.A\nspecific property of sets of objects randomly unorderly distributed in space is\ntheir interfaces orientation distribution. This distribution is usually\nobtained by the analysis of images sampled in the object sets. The density of\norientation probability of the fibers or of the texture interfaces, weighted by\ntheir length or by their area, can be interpreted as the radius of curvature of\nan outline or of a warped surface which characterizes, from a global and\nstatistical point of view, the texture geometry in two or three dimensions.\nThis figure named by the author the \"equivalent pore\", is with its elliptical\nshape similar to the one of the mean pore defined by the mean directional chord\nbetween the interfaces in the texture. Different methods of \"equivalent pore\"\nestablishing are analyzed : by conformal map of the fiber network or of the\ntexture interfaces, by images stereometric analysis of texture tomographical\ncuts, by scattering and diffraction of a laser light beam impacting the fibrous\ntexture or the material surface replica, by hard X-ray absorption and phase\ncontrast at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities(ESRF), in Grenoble.\nThe \"equivalent pore\" concept allows us to study random unordered sets behavior\nin strength fields while simplifying this analysis. Thus a phenomenon occurring\nin a plane set, in two dimensions, can be analyzed on its \"equivalent pore\"\nlinear outline, and a phenomenon which occurs in volume in a three dimensional\nset can be analyzed on its \"equivalent pore\" warped surface. This concept has\nbeen applied for physical, mechanical, optical and ionic conduction properties\nof materials like papers, boards, felts, nonwoven textiles, polymer foams,\nmetallic alloys with grain joints, geological grounds, and for the surface\nmapping of natural relief and of materials with different gloss, worn or\nroughness levels.The ellipse and the ellipso\\\"id, as well as multi-modes\ncompositions of it, are the most appropriate figures to represent the\n\"equivalent pore\" of materials with a random unordered texture. The fact that a\nlaw, which defines the curvature of an elliptic deterministic geometrical\nconfiguration, is essential to represent interface orientation allocation of\nelements whose spatial distribution is probabilistic is a noteworthy fact that\nmakes us wonder. This assertion is corroborated by fluid flow analysis through\nporous media. The global dissipated energy for fluid flow is distributed along\nthe motion (translation and rotation) and fluid deformation components on the\n\"equivalent pore\" whose surface is conformal to the texture interfaces\ntangential space. The porous media being homogenous and the fluid particles\nindistinguishable each ones from the others, due to permanent stochastic\nexchanges from one fluid volume element into another, we conclude that their\nmotion quantification is invariant on each point of the \"equivalent pore\"\nsurface. This quantification can be represented by a group of elliptical\ncylinders.The \"equivalent pore\" and cylinders group surface intersections\ndefine the fluid particle probabilistic paths in the porous media. One singular\ngeometrical configuration of the elliptic cylinders group union with the\nellipsoidal \"equivalent pore\" fulfills the minimal energy dissipation\nrequirements in the stress field applied to the fluid. The resulting paths are\nellipso\\\"ido-cylindrical curves carpeting the ellipso\\\"id by a beam of\nisoperim\\'etric lacets, in close or open loops depending on the possible\npairing off the curves in their nodals and isoclinal tangency points. The flow\nlaminarity and unrotationality are globally established in the porous media at\nthe macroscopic scale, for Reynold's number small values, in agreement with the\nresults found moreover. The so defined ellipso\\\"ido-cylindrical curve is a\nstationary curve at the average least action meaning, for a punctual mobile or\na deformable volume element moving on the surface of the ellipsoid from a nodal\nspot to the other in an antipodal position. This curve establishes a gauge\nwhich characterizes, from a global point of view, the physical space embraced\nby the fluid during its flow, in dynamical balance conditions compatible with\nthe stress field. The ellipso\\\"ido-cylindrical curve allows to carpet the\nellipso\\\"id as a function of one cyclic angular variable, which is a new\nconstruction for the ellipso\\\"id. When the set of the objects is isotropic the\ncurve is sphero-cylindrical whose plan mapping permit to decipher the tai-chi\nfigure of the Tao\\\"ist Buddhism philosophy.This study of random unordered\nobject sets, and more specially of fibrous porous media, allows to establish a\nstructural link between their small scale texture stochastic disorder and the\nharmonious order that emerges from these sets at a larger scale. The largest\nchance possible, compatible with the stress field which put a strain on these\nsets, is the necessary and sufficient variable which allows to best globally\nadjust their behaviors according to the probabilistic and deterministic laws\ngoverning their evolution.The vocabulary used in this study is issued from the\ncommon language, most of the time adapted to the material class, it is\ntransposable in other fields of interest. The text is completed by notes and a\nbibliography which refer to the works done following the presented concepts or\nin relation to this field of studies.\n","Comment: Derni\\`ere version, in French"]}]

All of them but that of genus 21 are most likely the minimal surfaces.\nSchoen-Luzzati gyroid minimal surface of genus 5 (per unit cell) is also\nobtained.\n","Comment: 10 pages plain TeX figures available on request or at\n  http://saka.ichf.edu.pl/WTGRH/surfaces.html Phys.

The stability equation for the bound system is studied\nin the homogeneous limit considering quantum fluctuations for the scalar and\npseudo scalar fields within a variational method with truncations. Nearly exact\nsolutions for the stability equation which also solve the field equations are\nsought semi-analytically. Bosonic fields are found to have non zero expected\nclassical values at finite density corresponding to condensates of dynamical\nsymmetry breakings. The two components of baryon field, neutron and proton for\nexample, acquire different masses due to the isospin symmetry breaking and\nthese states may even oscillate in the medium. There is a non trivial solution\nfor the (massive) vector meson field indicating the occurrence of a gauge\ndynamical symmetry breaking at finite density typical of a superconductor.\n","Comment: Withdrawn due to limited and wrong discussions"]}]
