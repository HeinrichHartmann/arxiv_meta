We establish algebraic properties\nsuch as the classification of one parameter groups of quadratic birational maps\nor the smoothness of the set of quadratic birational maps in the set of\nrational maps. We prove that a finite number of generic quadratic birational\nmaps generates a free group. We show that if f is a quadratic birational map or\nan automorphism of the projective plane, the normal subgroup generated by f is\nthe full group of birational maps of the projective plane, which implies that\nthis group is perfect. We study some dynamical properties: following an idea of\nGuillot, we translate some invariants for foliations in our context, in\nparticular we obtain that if two generic quadratic birational maps are\nbirationally conjugated, then they are conjugated by an automorphism of the\nprojective plane. We are also interested in the presence of \"invariant\nobjects\": curves, foliations, fibrations. Then follows a more experimental\npart: we draw orbits of quadratic birational maps with real coefficients and\nsets analogous to Julia sets for polynomials of one variable. We study\nbirational maps of degree 3 and, by considering the different possible\nconfigurations of the exceptional curves, we give the \"classification\" of these\nmaps. We can deduce from this that the set of the birational maps of degree 3\nexactly is irreducible, in fact rationally connected.\n","Comment: 224 pages; in French; for Chapter 6, which contains a lot of figures,\n  see http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~deserti/publications"]}]

The pSI leads to delocalization error\nin the polaron wave function and energy, as calculated from the Kohn-Sham (KS)\npotential in the native charge state of the polaron. This constitutes the\norigin of the systematic failure of DFT to describe polaron formation in band\ninsulators. It is shown that the delocalization error in these systems is,\nhowever, largely absent in the KS potential of the closed-shell neutral charge\nstate.

The resulting pSIC-DFT method\nconstitutes an accurate parameter-free {\\it ab initio} methodology for\ncalculating polaron properties in insulators at a computational cost that is\norders of magnitude smaller than hybrid XC functionals. Unlike approaches that\nrely on parametrized localized potentials such as DFT+$U$, the pSIC-DFT method\nproperly captures both site and bond-centered polaron configurations.

The pSIC-DFT approach consistently\nreproduces the results obtained by hybrid XC functionals parametrized by\nDFT+$G_0W_0$ calculations.

The system includes novel\nenrollment and authentication protocols based on threshold homomorphic\ncryptosystem where the private key is shared between a user and the verifier.\nIn the THRIVE system, only encrypted binary biometric templates are stored in\nthe database and verification is performed via homomorphically randomized\ntemplates, thus, original templates are never revealed during the\nauthentication stage. The THRIVE system is designed for the malicious model\nwhere the cheating party may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol\nspecification. Since threshold homomorphic encryption scheme is used, a\nmalicious database owner cannot perform decryption on encrypted templates of\nthe users in the database. Therefore, security of the THRIVE system is enhanced\nusing a two-factor authentication scheme involving the user's private key and\nthe biometric data.

The\nproposed system is suitable for applications where the user does not want to\nreveal her biometrics to the verifier in plain form but she needs to proof her\nphysical presence by using biometrics. The system can be used with any\nbiometric modality and biometric feature extraction scheme whose output\ntemplates can be binarized.

A complex\nscalar field charged under $U(1)_{B-L}$ is introduced to break the $U(1)_{B-L}$\nsymmetry. After $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking a remnant discrete symmetry\nstabilizes the lightest state of the Dirac fermions, which can be a stable dark\nmatter (DM). The second lightest state, if mass splitting with the stable DM is\nabout 3.5 keV, decays dominantly to the stable DM and 3.5 keV photon through\ntwo-loop diagrams, explaining the X-ray line signal. Two-loop suppression of\nthe decay amplitude makes its lifetime much longer than the age of the universe\nand it can be a decaying DM candidate in large parameter region.

It is the first time that these relations can be followed over such a\nlarge redshift range from a single homogeneously selected sample of galaxies\nwith spectroscopic redshifts. The log(SFR) - log(M_star) relation for SFGs\nremains roughly linear all the way up to z=5 but the SFR steadily increases at\nfixed mass with increasing redshift. We find that for stellar masses M_star>3.2\nx 10^9 M_sun the SFR increases by a factor ~13 between z=0.4 and z=2.3. We\nextend this relation up to z=5, finding an additional increase in SFR by a\nfactor 1.7 from z=2.3 to z=4.8 for masses M_star > 10^10 M_sun. We observe a\nturn-off in the SFR-M_star relation at the highest mass end up to a redshift\nz~3.5. We interpret this turn-off as the signature of a strong on-going\nquenching mechanism and rapid mass growth. The sSFR increases strongly up to\nz~2 but it grows much less rapidly in 2<z<5.

Rev. A 87, 043832 (2013)], to describe the\nquantum entanglement between a mirror's center of mass (CoM) motion and a\nfield. In contrast with the conventional approach where the mirror-field\nentanglement is understood as arising from the radiation pressure of an optical\nfield inducing the motion of the mirror's CoM, the MOF model incorporates the\ndynamics of the internal degrees of freedom of the mirror that couple to the\noptical field directly. The major advantage in this approach is that it\nprovides a self-consistent treatment of the three pertinent subsystems (the\nmirror's CoM motion, its internal degrees of freedom and the field) including\ntheir back-actions on each other, thereby giving a more accurate account of the\nquantum correlations between the individual subsystems. The optical and the\nmechanical properties of a mirror arising from its dynamical interaction with a\nquantum field are obtained without imposing any boundary conditions on the\nfield additionally, as is done in the conventional way. As one of the new\nphysical features that arise from this self-consistent treatment of the coupled\noptics and mechanics behavior we observe a coherent transfer of quantum\ncorrelations from the field to the mirror via its internal degrees of freedom.\nWe find the quantum entanglement between the optical field and the mirror's\ncenter of mass motion upon coarse-graining over the internal degree of freedom.\nFurther, we show that in certain parameter regimes the mirror-field\nentanglement is enhanced when the field interacts resonantly with the mirror's\ninternal degree of freedom, a new result which highlights the importance of\nincluding the internal structure of the mirror in quantum optomechanical\nstudies.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 5 figures"]}]

Then, under\nregularity hypothesis for the source distribution and attenuation map and\nconsidering small attenuations, we rigorously prove that the linear operator is\ninvertible and we compute its inverse explicitly. This allows to prove local\nuniqueness for the nonlinear inverse problem. Finally, using the previous\ninversion result for the linear operator, we propose a new type of iterative\nalgorithm for simultaneous source and attenuation recovery for SPECT based on\nNeumann series and a Newton-Raphson algorithm.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 30 figures.

For most quantitative\nmeasures, this direct information does not extend more than a century and a\nhalf into the recent past. The magnitude distributions (occurrence frequencies)\nof solar events (flares/CMEs) typically decrease with the parameter measured or\ninferred (peak flux, mass, energy etc. Flare radiation fluxes tend to follow a\npower law slightly flatter than $S^{-2}$, where S represents a peak flux; solar\nparticle events (SPEs) follow a still flatter power law up to a limiting\nmagnitude, and then appear to roll over to a steeper distribution, which may\ntake an exponential form or follow a broken power law. This inference comes\nfrom the terrestrial $^{14}$C record and from the depth dependence of various\nradioisotope proxies in the lunar regolith and in meteorites. Recently major\nnew observational results have impacted our use of the relatively limited\nhistorical record in new ways: the detection of actual events in the $^{14}$C\ntree-ring records, and the systematic observations of flares and \"superflares\"\nby the Kepler spacecraft. I discuss how these new findings may affect our\nunderstanding of the distribution function expected for extreme solar events.\n","Comment: 24th European Cosmic Ray Symposium, Christian-Albrechts-Universitaet\n  zu Kiel, September 2014"]}]

We developed a\ncode that follows the evolution and emission of electrons in the shocked pulsar\nwind based on inputs from a relativistic hydrodynamical simulation. The code is\nused to model the well-documented spectral energy distribution and orbital\nmodulations from LS 5039. The pulsar wind is fully confined by a bow shock and\na back shock. The particles are distributed into a narrow Maxwellian, emitting\nmostly GeV photons, and a power law radiating very efficiently over a broad\nenergy range from X-rays to TeV gamma rays. Most of the emission arises from\nthe apex of the bow shock. Doppler boosting shapes the X-ray and VHE\nlightcurves, constraining the system inclination to $i\\approx 35^{\\rm o}$.\nThere is a tension between the hard VHE spectrum and the level of X-ray to MeV\nemission, which requires differing magnetic field intensities that are hard to\nachieve with a constant magnetisation $\\sigma$ and Lorentz factor $\\Gamma_{p}$\nof the pulsar wind.

Skyrmions, stable topological spin\ntextures with particle-like properties, have many similarities to vortices but\ntheir behavior is strongly influenced by non-disspative effects arising from a\nMagnus term in their equation of motion. We show using numerical simulations\nthat pronounced ratchet effects can occur for ac driven skyrmions moving over\nasymmetric quasi-one-dimensional substrates. We find a new type of ratchet\neffect called a Magnus-induced transverse ratchet that arises when the ac\ndriving force is applied perpendicular rather than parallel to the asymmetry\ndirection of the substrate. This transverse ratchet effect only occurs when the\nMagnus term is finite, and the threshold ac amplitude needed to induce it\ndecreases as the Magnus term becomes more prominent. Ratcheting skyrmions\nfollow ordered orbits in which the net displacement parallel to the substrate\nasymmetry direction is quantized.

The\nreason for this feature is the too strong density-dependence $\\rho^{8/3}$ of\nseveral second-order contributions.

In the region of relatively high\ntemperatures and low magnetic fields, the relaxation rate $W$ is determined by\ntwo competing effects. The first one is its decrease in result of suppression\nof quasi-particle density of states (DOS) due to formation of fluctuation\nCooper pairs (FCP). The second one is a specific, purely quantum, relaxation\nprocess of the Maki-Thompson (MT) type, which for low field leads to an\nincrease of the relaxation rate. The latter describes particular fluctuation\nprocesses involving self-pairing of a single electron on self-intersecting\ntrajectories of a size up to phase-breaking length $l_{\\phi }$ which becomes\npossible due to an electron spin-flip scattering event at a nucleus. As a\nresult, different scenarios with either growth or decrease of the NMR\nrelaxation rate are possible upon approaching the normal metal - type-II\nsuperconductor transition. The character of fluctuations changes along the line\n$H_{c2}$ from the thermal long-wavelength type in weak magnetic fields to the\nclusters of rotating FCP in fields comparable to $H_{c2}$. We find that below\nthe well-defined temperature $T^*_0\\approx 0.6T_{c0}$, the MT process becomes\nineffective even in absence of intrinsic pair-breaking. The small scale of FCP\nrotations ($\\xi_{xy}$) in so high fields impedes formation of long (<$l_{\\phi\n}$) self-intersecting trajectories, causing the corresponding relaxation\nmechanism to lose its efficiency. This reduces the effect of superconducting\nfluctuations in the domain of high fields and low temperatures to just the\nsuppression of quasi-particle DOS, analogously to the Abrikosov vortex phase\nbelow the $H_{c2}$ line.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 7 figures"]}]

The mass-loss\nrate can be well traced by carbon monoxide (CO) line emission.\n  AIMS: We present new Herschel HIFI and IRAM 30m telescope CO line data for a\nsample of 53 galactic AGB stars. The lines cover a fairly large range of\nexcitation energy from the $J=1\\to0$ line to the $J=9\\to8$ line, and even the\n$J=14\\to13$ line in a few cases. We perform radiative transfer modelling for 38\nof these sources to estimate their mass-loss rates.\n  METHODS: We used a radiative transfer code based on the Monte Carlo method to\nmodel the CO line emission. We assume spherically symmetric circumstellar\nenvelopes that are formed by a constant mass-loss rate through a smoothly\naccelerating wind.\n  RESULTS: We find models that are consistent across a broad range of CO lines\nfor most of the stars in our sample, i.e., a large number of the circumstellar\nenvelopes can be described with a constant mass-loss rate. We also find that an\naccelerating wind is required to fit, in particular, the higher-J lines and\nthat a velocity law will have a significant effect on the model line\nintensities.

The\npursuit of fast rates in online and statistical learning has led to the\ndiscovery of many conditions in learning theory under which fast learning is\npossible. We show that most of these conditions are special cases of a single,\nunifying condition, that comes in two forms: the central condition for 'proper'\nlearning algorithms that always output a hypothesis in the given model, and\nstochastic mixability for online algorithms that may make predictions outside\nof the model. We show that under surprisingly weak assumptions both conditions\nare, in a certain sense, equivalent.

For bounded losses, we\nshow how the central condition enables a direct proof of fast rates and we\nprove its equivalence to the Bernstein condition, itself a generalization of\nthe Tsybakov margin condition, both of which have played a central role in\nobtaining fast rates in statistical learning. Yet, while the Bernstein\ncondition is two-sided, the central condition is one-sided, making it more\nsuitable to deal with unbounded losses.

Inflation in supergravity, however, cannot be easily described\nbecause of restrictions from supersymmetry (SUSY). The scalar potential has an\nexponential factor and a large negative term whereas a flat and positive\npotential is needed to realize inflation. The standard method to obtain such an\ninflationary scalar potential requires an additional superfield to the one\ncontaining inflaton. In this thesis, we propose and develop an alternative\nmethod which does not require the additional superfield and thus reduces the\nnecessary degrees of freedom by half. That is, we study inflation in\nsupergravity with only a single chiral superfield which contains inflaton. We\naccomplish it by introducing a higher dimensional term in the inflaton Kahler\npotential, which plays an important dual role: fixing the value of the scalar\nsuperpartner of the inflaton resulting in effective single field models, and\nensuring the positivity of the inflaton potential at the large field region.\nOur proposal is not just particular models but rather a new framework to\nrealize various inflationary models in supergravity. In particular, large field\ninflation in supergravity using one superfield without tuning has become\npossible for the first time. In our generic models, SUSY breaking at the\ninflationary scale by inflaton is not completely restored after inflation, so\nnull results for SUSY search at the LHC are predicted for the simplest cases.\nRemarkably, however, it is possible with tuning to embed arbitrary positive\nsemidefinite scalar potentials into supergravity preserving SUSY at the vacuum.\nOur discovery opens up an entirely new branch of model building of inflation in\nsupergravity.\n","Comment: Ph.D. thesis, The University of Tokyo, Dec. 2014; 125 pages, 3\n  tables, 15 figures"]}]

The results support a role for ecological opportunity in\nspeciation, but its importance in the evolution of the latitudinal gradient\nremains uncertain. I conclude that per-capita evolutionary rates are no longer\nhigher in the tropics than the temperate zone. Nevertheless, the vast numbers\nof species that have already accumulated in the tropics ensure that total rate\nof species production remains highest there. Thus, tropical evolutionary\nmomentum helps to perpetuate the steep latitudinal biodiversity gradient.\n","Comment: Based on a presidential address at the 2013 evolution conference of\n  the American Society of Naturalists in Snowbird, Utah"]}]

We make this\nnotion precise by introducing regularly varying time series. We provide general\nlarge deviation results for functionals acting on a sample path and vanishing\nin some neighborhood of the origin. We study a variety of such functionals,\nincluding large deviations of random walks, their suprema, the ruin functional,\nand further derive weak limit theory for maxima, point processes, cluster\nfunctionals and the tail empirical process. One of the main results of this\npaper concerns bounds for the ruin probability in various heavy-tailed models\nincluding GARCH, stochastic volatility models and solutions to stochastic\nrecurrence equations. 1. Preliminaries and basic motivation In the last\ndecades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory\nfor dependent sequences, including Markov chains (Meyn and Tweedie [42]),\nweakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al. [21]), long-range dependent\nsequences (Doukhan et al. [23], Samorodnitsky [54]), empirical processes\n(Dehling et al. [22]) and more general structures (Eberlein and Taqqu [25]), to\nname a few references. A smaller part of the theory was devoted to limit theory\nunder extremal dependence for point processes, maxima, partial sums, tail\nempirical processes. Resnick [49, 50] started a systematic study of the\nrelations between the convergence of point processes, sums and maxima, see also\nResnick [51] for a recent account. He advocated the use of multivariate regular\nvariation as a flexible tool to describe heavy-tail phenomena combined with\nadvanced continuous mapping techniques. For example, maxima and sums are\nunderstood as functionals acting on an underlying point process, if the point\nprocess converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are\ndescribed in terms of the points of the limiting point process. Davis and Hsing\n[13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes,\nmaxima, sums, and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes,\ni.e., stationary sequences whose finite-dimensional distributions are regularly\nvarying with the same index. Before [13], limit theory for particular regularly\nvarying stationary sequences was studied for the sample mean, maxima, sample\nautocovariance and autocorrelation functions of linear and bilinear processes\nwith iid regularly varying noise and extreme value theory was considered for\nregularly varying ARCH processes and solutions to stochastic recurrence\nequation, see Rootz\\'en [53], Davis and 1991 Mathematics Subject\nClassification.

This is done through shortest path computation in a temporal\nneighborhood of the key-node. The approach is conservative in that it only\naggregates the shortest paths that are sufficiently better compared to\nalternative paths. It is also multi-scale in that the size of the investigated\nneighborhood is increased proportionally to the number of detections already\naggregated into the key-node. The multi-scale nature of the process and the\nprogressive relaxation of its conservativeness makes it both computationally\nefficient and effective.\n  Experimental validations are performed extensively on a toy example, a 15\nminutes long multi-view basketball dataset, and other monocular pedestrian\ndatasets.\n","Comment: 21 pages, 8 figures, submitted to CVIU: Special Issue on Visual\n  Tracking"]}]

We argue that the reference view selection should\nideally be performed close to the users, and we study the problem of in-network\nreference view synthesis such that the navigation quality is maximized at the\nclients. We consider a distributed cloud network architecture where data stored\nin a main cloud is delivered to end users with the help of cloudlets, i.e.,\nresource-rich proxies close to the users. In order to satisfy last-hop\nbandwidth constraints from the cloudlet to the users, a cloudlet re-samples\nviewpoints of the 3D scene into a discrete set of views (combination of\nreceived camera views and virtual views synthesized) to be used as reference\nfor the synthesis of additional virtual views at the client. This in-network\nsynthesis leads to better viewpoint sampling given a bandwidth constraint\ncompared to simple selection of camera views, but it may however carry a\ndistortion penalty in the cloudlet-synthesized reference views. We therefore\ncast a new reference view selection problem where the best subset of views is\ndefined as the one minimizing the distortion over a view navigation window\ndefined by the user under some transmission bandwidth constraints. We show that\nthe view selection problem is NP-hard, and propose an effective polynomial time\nalgorithm using dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem.\nSimulation results finally confirm the performance gain offered by virtual view\nsynthesis in the network.\n"]}]
