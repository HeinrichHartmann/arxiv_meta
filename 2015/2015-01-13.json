The location\nof the break can be identified by amplifying and identifying the segments of\ncut ssNA using techniques well known to biologists. Thus the path of the\nrecoiling nucleus can be tracked to nanometer accuracy.

The physical\nparameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and\ndownstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result\nto the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only\nremaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,\nis determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the\nobserved amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and\ngamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal\nnuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel\nregions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved\nfit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission\nspectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas\nnumber density $N_H\\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from\nobservations of thermal X-rays.

Several prior\nstudies quantified the increase of the packing density as a function of\npolydispersity.

We implement a novel\nmodel of SF with a deterministic low efficiency per free-fall time, as observed\nin molecular clouds. Stellar feedback is based on observations of star-forming\nregions, and includes radiation pressure from massive stars, photoheating in H\nII regions, supernovae and stellar winds. We find that stellar radiation has a\nstrong effect on the formation of low-mass galaxies, especially at z > 1, where\nit efficiently suppresses SF by dispersing cold and dense gas, preventing\nrunaway growth of the stellar component. This behaviour is evident in a variety\nof observations but had so far eluded analytical and numerical models without\nradiation feedback. Compared to supernovae alone, radiation feedback reduces\nthe SF rate by a factor of ~100 at z < 2, yielding rising SF histories which\nreproduce recent observations of Local Group dwarfs. Stellar radiation also\nproduces bulgeless spiral galaxies and may be responsible for excess thickening\nof the stellar disc.

While the majority of the target stars\nare main-sequence dwarfs of spectral type F, G, and K, Kepler covers stars with\neffective temperature as low as 2500 K, which corresponds to M stars. These\ncooler stars allow characterization of small planets near the habitable zone,\nyet it is not clear if this population is representative of that around FGK\nstars. In this paper, we calculate the occurrence of planets around stars of\ndifferent spectral types as a function of planet radius and distance from the\nstar, and show that they are significantly different from each other. We\nfurther identify two trends: First, the occurrence of Earth to Neptune-sized\nplanets is successively higher toward later spectral types at all orbital\nperiods probed by Kepler; Planets around M stars occur twice as frequently as\naround G stars, and thrice as frequently as around F stars. Second, a drop in\nplanet occurrence is evident at all spectral types inward of a 10 day orbital\nperiod, with a plateau further out. By assigning to each spectral type a median\nstellar mass, we show that the distance from the star where this drop occurs is\nstellar mass dependent, and scales with semi-major axis as the cube root of\nstellar mass. By comparing different mechanisms of planet formation, trapping\nand destruction, we find that this scaling best matches the location of the\npre-main-sequence co-rotation radius, indicating efficient trapping of\nmigrating planets or planetary building blocks.

SPT phases outside the classification of Chen et al are\nthose in which the symmetry cannot be represented locally on the edge. With\nsome modifications, our framework can also be applied to fermionic systems in\n(2+1)-D.\n","Comment: 23 pages + 11 pages of appendices; v2 added references; v3 final\n  published version"]}]

Water is the ideal tracer of these effects\nbecause it is present in high abundance in various parts of the protostar.\nMethod: We present \\textit{Herschel} HIFI spectra of multiple water-transitions\ntowards 29 nearby Class 0/I protostars as part of the WISH Survey. These are\ndecomposed into different Gaussian components, with each related to one of\nthree parts of the protostellar system; quiescent envelope, cavity shock and\nspot shocks in the jet and at the base of the outflow. We then constrain the\nexcitation conditions present in the two outflow-related components. Results:\nWater emission is optically thick but effectively thin, with line ratios that\ndo not vary with velocity, in contrast to CO. The physical conditions of the\ncavity and spot shocks are similar, with post-shock H$_{2}$ densities of order\n10$^{5}-$10$^{8}$\\,cm$^{-3}$ and H$_{2}$O column densities of order\n10$^{16}-$10$^{18}$\\,cm$^{-2}$. H$_{2}$O emission originates in compact\nemitting regions: for the spot shocks these correspond to point sources with\nradii of order 10-200\\,AU, while for the cavity shocks these come from a thin\nlayer along the outflow cavity wall with thickness of order 1-30\\,AU.\nConclusions: Water emission at the source position traces two distinct\nkinematic components in the outflow; J shocks at the base of the outflow or in\nthe jet, and C shocks in a thin layer in the cavity wall. Class I sources have\nsimilar excitation conditions to Class 0 sources, but generally smaller\nline-widths and emitting region sizes. We suggest that it is the velocity of\nthe wind driving the outflow, rather than the decrease in envelope density or\nmass, that is the cause of the decrease in H$_{2}$O intensity between Class 0\nand I.\n","Comment: Abstract is abridged.

An optimum orthogonal array can extract as much information as\npossible at a fixed cost. Finding (optimum) orthogonal arrays is an open (yet\nfundamental) problem in design of experiments because constructing (optimum)\northogonal arrays or proving non-existence becomes intractable as the number of\nruns and factors increase. Enumerating orthogonal arrays is equivalent to\nfinding all feasible solutions to a class of inherently symmetric constraint\nsatisfaction problems. The inherent symmetry implies that the solutions remain\nfeasible under the action of a group permuting the variables. This causes the\nnumber of feasible solutions to be huge. We develop algorithms for enumerating\northogonal arrays that call the Margot (2007) isomorphism pruning algorithm and\nbring the enumeration of OA(160, k, 2, 4) for k = 9, 10 and OA(176, k, 2, 4)\nfor k = 8, 9, 10 within computational reach.

However, measurement traces from real-world production\nenvironment show that the duration of tasks within a job vary widely. The\noverall elapsed time of a job, i.e. the so-called flowtime, is often dictated\nby one or few slowly-running tasks within a job, generally referred as the\n\"stragglers\". The cause of stragglers include tasks running on\npartially/intermittently failing machines or the existence of some localized\nresource bottleneck(s) within a MapReduce cluster. To tackle this online job\nscheduling challenge, we adopt the task cloning approach and design the\ncorresponding scheduling algorithms which aim at minimizing the weighted sum of\njob flowtimes in a MapReduce cluster based on the Shortest Remaining Processing\nTime scheduler (SRPT). To be more specific, we first design a 2-competitive\noffline algorithm when the variance of task-duration is negligible. We then\nextend this offline algorithm to yield the so-called SRPTMS+C algorithm for the\nonline case and show that SRPTMS+C is $(1+\\epsilon)-speed$\n$o(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2})-competitive$ in reducing the weighted sum of job\nflowtimes within a cluster. Both of the algorithms explicitly consider the\nprecedence constraints between the two phases within the MapReduce framework.\nWe also demonstrate via trace-driven simulations that SRPTMS+C can\nsignificantly reduce the weighted/unweighted sum of job flowtimes by cutting\ndown the elapsed time of small jobs substantially. In particular, SRPTMS+C\nbeats the Microsoft Mantri scheme by nearly 25% according to this metric.\n"]}]

Methods: In\nthis cross-sectional, retrospective study, data from 9,948 US patients between\n2009 and 2012 were used to develop a pre-screening tool to predict current type\n2 diabetes, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared (1) a full EHR\nmodel containing prescribed medications, diagnoses, and traditional predictive\ninformation, (2) a restricted EHR model where medication information was\nremoved, and (3) a conventional model containing only traditional predictive\ninformation (BMI, age, gender, hypertensive and smoking status).

For instance, the optimal rate of parameter\nestimation in an over-fitted location-covariance Gaussian mixture is precisely\ndetermined by the order of a solvable system of polynomial equations --- these\nrates deteriorate rapidly as more extra components are added to the model.

Moreover, the\nexisting mmW standards schedule a single link in each time slot and hence do\nnot fully exploit the potential of mmW communications, where directional\ncommunications allow multiple concurrent transmissions.

More precisely, the\nscheduling solution affects the quality of the achievable placement solution\ndue to resource pressures that may be created as a result of operation\nscheduling whereas the operation placement and qubit routing solutions\ninfluence the scheduling solution due to resulting distances between\npredecessor and current operations, which in turn determines routing latencies.\nThe proposed flow for the quantum physical mapper captures these dependencies\nby applying (i) a loose scheduling step, which transforms an initial quantum\ndata flow graph into one that explicitly captures the no-cloning theorem of the\nquantum computing and then performs instruction scheduling based on a modified\nforce-directed scheduling approach to minimize the resource contention and\nquantum circuit latency, (ii) a placement step, which uses timing-driven\ninstruction placement to minimize the approximate routing latencies while\nmaking iterative calls to the aforesaid force-directed scheduler to correct\nscheduling levels of quantum operations as needed, and (iii) a routing step\nthat finds dynamic values of routing latencies for the qubits. In addition to\nthe quantum physical mapper, an approach is presented to determine the single\nbest ULB size for a target quantum circuit by examining the latency of\ndifferent FT quantum operations mapped onto different ULB sizes and using\ninformation about the occurrence frequency of operations on critical paths of\nthe target quantum algorithm to weigh these latencies.\n"]}]

Reflecting this, there has been a\ngrowing interest in studying information-flow properties which change during\nprogram execution, including concepts such as declassification, revocation, and\nrole-change.\n  A static verification of a dynamic information flow policy, from a semantic\nperspective, should only need to concern itself with two things: 1) the\ndependencies between data in a program, and 2) whether those dependencies are\nconsistent with the intended flow policies as they change over time. In this\npaper we provide a formal ground for this intuition. We present a\nstraightforward extension to the principal flow-sensitive type system\nintroduced by Hunt and Sands (POPL '06, ESOP '11) to infer both end-to-end\ndependencies and dependencies at intermediate points in a program. This allows\ntypings to be applied to verification of both static and dynamic policies. Our\nextension preserves the principal type system's distinguishing feature, that\ntype inference is independent of the policy to be enforced: a single, generic\ndependency analysis (typing) can be used to verify many different dynamic\npolicies of a given program, thus achieving a clean separation between (1) and\n(2).\n  We also make contributions to the foundations of dynamic information flow.\nArguably, the most compelling semantic definitions for dynamic security\nconditions in the literature are phrased in the so-called knowledge-based\nstyle.

Using the Unruh-DeWitt detectors we find an adiabatic\nexpansion of the detection properties along linear trajectories with slowly\nvarying acceleration in Minkowski, which allows us to calculate the spectrum\ndetected, finding the thermal spectrum as the zeroth order contribution. Using\nthe ETF we study the perception of Hawking radiation by observers following\nradial trajectories outside a Schwarzschild black hole. One of the most\nimportant results is that, in general, free-falling observers crossing the\nevent horizon do detect some radiation, even when the field is in the Unruh\nvacuum state, due to a Doppler blue-shift that diverges at the horizon. We give\na general expression for the ETF, which has a clear interpretation in terms of\nwell-known physical phenomena. We discuss which contribution to the perception\ncomes from the radiation emitted by the black hole, and which contribution is\ndue to the Unruh effect caused by the movement of the observer. We conclude\nthat the Unruh effect is not only due to the observer's proper acceleration and\ncannot even be defined locally, but is due to the observer's acceleration with\nrespect to the asymptotic region. We apply the ETF to the analysis of different\nphysical situations, in particular to a possible buoyancy scenario near the\nhorizon due to Hawking radiation pressure.
