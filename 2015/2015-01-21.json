Our main goal is to construct an inflationary model which not only\npredicts the important cosmological quantities such as $(n_s, r)$ compatible\nwith experimental observation, but also is consistent with the low energy\neffective theory framework. Therefore, all the fundamental scale apart from\n$M_p$ and quantities of our interest should be within the sub-Planckian region.\nIn order to achieve our goal we modify the usual single field natural\ninflationary model by a specific form of higher derivative kinetic term called\nkinetic gravity braiding (KGB). One of our guiding principles to construct such\na model is the constant shift symmetry of the axion. We have chosen the form of\nthe KGB term in such a way that it predicts the required value of $n_s\\simeq\n0.96$ and a large tensor to scalar ratio $r> 0.1$. Importantly for a wide range\nof parameter space our model has sub-Planckian axion decay constant $f$ and the\nscale of inflation $\\Lambda$. However, the reheating after the end of inflation\nlimits the value of $f$ so that we are unable to get $f$ to be significantly\nlower than $M_p$.

The extreme spatial extent of the outflow allows\nus, for the first time in an external galaxy, to estimate mass-loss rate,\nkinetic power and momentum rate of the outflow as a function of the projected\ndistance from the nucleus and the dynamical time-scale. These trends reveal\nmultiple outflow events during the past 100 Myr, although the bulk of the mass,\nenergy and momentum appear to have been released more recently, within the past\n~20 Myr. Surprisingly, we discover that also the quiescent gas at systemic\nvelocity is extremely extended. More specifically, we find that, while 30% of\nthe [CII] within v\\in(-200, 200) km/s traces a compact component that is not\nresolved by our observations, 70% of the [CII] emission in this velocity range\nis extended, with a projected FWHM size of 17.4+-1.4 kpc. We detect FIR\ncontinuum emission associated with both the compact and the extended [CII]\ncomponents, although the extended FIR emission has a FWHM of 11+-3 kpc, thus\nsmaller than the extended [CII] source. Overall, our results indicate that the\ncold gas traced by [CII] is distributed up to r~30 kpc. A large fraction of\nextended [CII] is likely associated with star formation on large scales, but\nthe [CII] source extends well beyond the FIR continuum.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A, 21 pages, 18 figures, 3 tables (v2:\n  accepted version, discussion expanded in Sect. 3, 4 and in the Appendices,\n  minor changes elsewhere)"]}]

The\nemission of all but one line is spatially resolved. The dust and molecular\nlines are centered around the continuum peak position. The dust emission has an\nasymmetric distribution with a central peak flux density of ~2 Jy. The\nmolecular emission lines trace different regions in the wind acceleration\nregion and suggest that the wind velocity increases rapidly from about 5 R*\nalmost reaching the terminal velocity at ~11 R*. The channel maps for the\nbrighter lines show a complex structure; specifically for the 13CO J=6-5 line\ndifferent arcs are detected within the first few arcseconds. The curved\nstructure present in the PV map of the 13CO J=6-5 line can be explained by a\nspiral structure in the inner wind, probably induced by a binary companion.\nFrom modeling the ALMA data, we deduce that the potential orbital axis for the\nbinary system lies at a position angle of ~10-20 deg to the North-East and that\nthe spiral structure is seen almost edge-on. We infer an orbital period of 55\nyr and a binary separation of 25 au (or ~8.2 R*). We tentatively estimate that\nthe companion is an unevolved low-mass main-sequence star. The ALMA data hence\nprovide us for the first time with the crucial kinematical link between the\ndust clumps seen at milli-arcsecond scale and the almost concentric arcs seen\nat arcsecond scale.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 18 Figures, Astronomy & Astrophysics"]}]

Disadvantages of the technique are also discussed, and\ninclude the disability to distinguish between different values of the spherical\ndegree and azimuthal order of the oscillation modes without additional\ntheoretical modelling. Conclusions. Despite the shortcomings, the method is\nshown to allow solid detections of period spacings for {\\gamma} Doradus stars,\nwhich will allow future asteroseismic analyses of these stars.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables.

MO is located along\nthe jet of NGC 541 and also shows star formation.

In the central galaxies, the spectra present a double-horn profile,\ntypical of a rotation pattern, from which we are able to estimate the molecular\ngas density profile of the galaxy.

The short delay times in the He channel support the young\nhost environments of SNe Iax.

In this paper, we propose an innovative source localization\nmethod for EEG, based on Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). Methods: To better\nspecify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the\nproposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside\nhuman brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with\nimposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain\nactivity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a\nrealistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head\nand includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity\nvalues. The results demonstrate that the isotropy constraint significantly\nimproves the performance of SBL. In a noiseless environment, the proposed\nmethod was 1 found to accurately (with accuracy of >75%) locate up to 6\nsimultaneously active sources, whereas for SBL without the isotropy constraint,\nthe accuracy of finding just 3 simultaneously active sources was <75%.\nConclusions: Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method\nis potentially more consistent in specifying the sparsity profile of human\nbrain activity and is able to produce better source localization for EEG.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1406.2434"]}]

The simulations show the\nemergence of a self-similar hierarchical structure in both the phase space and\nthe configuration space and invites the implementation of a multifractal\nanalysis. Here, after showing that symmetry considerations leads to the\nconstruction of a family of equations of motion of the one-dimensional\ngravitational system, we apply four different methods for computing generalized\ndimensions $D_q$ of the distribution of particles in configuration space. We\nfirst employ the conventional box counting and correlation integral methods\nbased on partitions of equal size and then the less familiar nearest-neighbor\nand k-neighbor methods based on partitions of equal mass. We show that the\nlatter are superior for computing generalized dimensions for indices $q<-1$\nwhich characterize regions of low density.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures"]}]

Various metrics have been proposed to\nmeasure the efficacy of the repair of a failed node, such as the amount of data\ndownload needed to repair (also known as the repair bandwidth), the amount of\ndata accessed at the helper nodes, and the number of helper nodes contacted.\nClearly, the amount of data accessed can never be smaller than the repair\nbandwidth. In the case of a help-by-transfer code, the amount of data accessed\nis equal to the repair bandwidth. It follows that a help-by-transfer code\npossessing optimal repair bandwidth is access optimal.

In computability theory the notion of\nencoding is crucial for defining computability on arbitrary domains, as well as\nfor comparing the power of models of computation. In language theory much\nattention has been devoted to regularity preserving functions.\n  A natural question arising in these contexts is: Is there a bijective\nencoding such that its image function preserves regularity of languages, but\nits pre-image function does not? Our main result answers this question in the\naffirmative: For every countable class C of languages there exists a bijective\nencoding f such that for every language L in C its image f[L] is regular.\n  Our construction of such encodings has several noteworthy consequences.\nFirstly, anomalies arise when models of computation are compared with respect\nto a known concept of implementation that is based on encodings which are not\nrequired to be computable: Every countable decision model can be implemented,\nin this sense, by finite-state automata, even via bijective encodings. Hence\ndeterministic finite-state automata would be equally powerful as Turing machine\ndeciders.\n  A second consequence concerns the recognizability of sets of natural numbers\nvia number representations and finite automata. A set of numbers is said to be\nrecognizable with respect to a representation if an automaton accepts the\nlanguage of representations.
