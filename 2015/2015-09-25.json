Although the methodology applies to general scenarios, the\npresent work focuses on a situation with an asymmetric observation structure\nthat only involves two agents. More precisely, one of the agents knows the\npast, present, and future realizations of a state (the system state) that\naffects the common payoff function of the agents; in contrast, the second agent\nis assumed either to know the past realizations of the system state or to have\nno knowledge of it. In both cases, the second agent has access to some strictly\ncausal observations of the first agent's actions, which enables the two agents\nto coordinate. These scenarios are applied to the problem of distributed power\ncontrol; the key idea is that a transmitter may embed information about the\nwireless channel state into its transmit power levels so that an observation of\nthese levels, e.g. the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, allows the\nother transmitter to coordinate its power levels. The main contributions of\nthis paper are twofold. First, we provide a characterization of the set of\nfeasible average payoffs when the agents repeatedly take long sequences of\nactions and the realizations of the system state are \\acs{iid}. Second, we\nexploit these results in the context of distributed power control and introduce\nthe concept of coded power control.

Furthermore, we\nfound that the graphene nanoribbon meta-surface based CPA is realizable with\nexperimental graphene data. The findings of CPA with graphene meta-surface can\nbe generalized for potential applications in optical detections and signal\nprocessing with two-dimensional optoelectronic materials.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 6 figures"]}]

This implies that the\nso-called finite section method for the approximate solution of a system\n$A_+x=b$ is applicable as soon as $A_+$ is invertible, and that the same method\nfor estimating the spectrum of $A_+$ does not suffer from spectral pollution.\nBoth results illustrate that tridiagonal stochastic Toeplitz operators share\nimportant properties of (classical) Toeplitz operators. One of our main tools\nis a new version of the Coburn lemma for classical Toeplitz operators, saying\nthat a stochastic tridiagonal Toeplitz operator, if Fredholm, is always\ninjective or surjective. In the final part we bound and compare the norms, and\nthe norms of inverses, of bi-infinite, semi-infinite and finite tridiagonal\nmatrices over $U$, $V$ and $W$. This allows the study of the resolvent norms,\nand hence the pseudospectra, of these operators and matrices.\n","Comment: 30 pages, 1 figure"]}]

In our system the\ninitially unknown Hamiltonian arises from transporting an ion through a static,\nnear-resonant laser beam. Hamiltonian estimation allows us to estimate the\nspatial dependence of the laser beam intensity and the ion's velocity as a\nfunction of time. This work is of direct value in optimizing transport\noperations and transport-based gates in scalable trapped ion quantum\ninformation processing, while the estimation technique is general enough that\nit can be applied to other quantum systems, aiding the pursuit of high\noperational fidelities in quantum control.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures"]}]

It renders\nT-duality on a torus manifest by adding $D$ winding coordinates in addition to\nthe $D$ space time coordinates. An essential consistency constraint of the\ntheory, the strong constraint, only allows for field configurations which\ndepend on half of the coordinates of the arising doubled space. I derive\nDFT${}_\\mathrm{WZW}$, a generalization of the current formalism. It captures\nthe low energy dynamics of a closed bosonic string propagating on a compact\ngroup manifold. Its classical action and the corresponding gauge\ntransformations arise from Closed String Field Theory up to cubic order in the\nmassless fields. These results are rewritten in terms of a generalized metric\nand extended to all orders in the fields. There is an explicit distinction\nbetween background and fluctuations. For the gauge algebra to close, the latter\nhave to fulfill a modified strong constraint, while for the former the weaker\nclosure constraint is sufficient. Besides the generalized diffeomorphism\ninvariance known from the original formulation, DFT${}_\\mathrm{WZW}$ is\ninvariant under standard diffeomorphisms of the doubled space. They are broken\nby imposing the totally optional extended strong constraint. In doing so, the\noriginal formulation is restored. A flux formulation for the new theory is\nderived and its connection to generalized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications is\ndiscussed. Further, a possible tree-level uplift of a genuinely non-geometric\nbackground (not T-dual to any geometric configuration) is presented. Finally, a\nlong standing problem, the missing of a prescription to construct the twist in\ngeneralized Scherk-Schwarz compactifications, is solved.

Regulated independently by the pushing beam, the atomic flux can be\nsubstantially optimized. The atomic flux maximum obtained in the 2D-HP MOT is\n$4.02\\times 10^{10}$ atoms/s, increased by 60 percent compared to the\ntraditional 2D$^+$ MOT in our experiment. Moreover, with the pushing power 10\n$\\mu$W and detuning $0\\Gamma$, the 2D-HP MOT can generate a rather intense cold\ncesium atomic beam with the concomitant light shift suppressed by 20 times in\nmagnitude. The axial velocity distribution of the cold cesium beams centers at\n6.8 m/s with a FMHW of about 2.8 m/s. The dependences of the atomic flux on the\npushing power and detuning are studied.

More precisely, the considered cost function results from a\nlinear combination of two parts: a cost with memory and a memoryless cost. In\nthis paper, the first component is identified to be the transformer ageing\nwhile the second one corresponds to distribution Joule losses. First, we\nformulate the problem as a non-trivial discrete-time optimal control problem\nwith finite time horizon. It is non-trivial because of the presence of\nsaturation constraints and a non-quadratic cost. It turns out that the system\nstate, which is the transformer hot-spot (HS) temperature here, can be\nexpressed as a function of the sequence of control variables; the cost function\nis then seen to be convex in the control for typical values for the model\nparameters. The problem of interest thus becomes a standard optimization\nproblem. While the corresponding problem can be solved by using available\nnumerical routines, three distributed charging policies are provided. The\nmotivation is threefold: to decrease the computational complexity; to model the\nimportant scenario where the charging profile is chosen by the EV itself; to\ncircumvent the allocation problem which arises with the proposed formulation.\nRemarkably, the performance loss induced by decentralization is verified to be\nsmall through simulations. Numerical results show the importance of the choice\nof the charging policies. For instance, the gain in terms of transformer\nlifetime can be very significant when implementing advanced charging policies\ninstead of plug-and-charge policies.

In this work, an aggregator is seen as an entity (a coalition) which\nis able to manage jointly the energy demand of a large group of consumers or\nusers. More precisely, the demand consists in charging an electrical vehicle\n(EV) battery. The way the EVs user charge their batteries matters since it\nstrongly impacts the network, especially the distribution network costs (e.g.,\nin terms of Joule losses or transformer ageing). Since the charging policy is\nchosen by the users or the aggregators, the charging problem is naturally\ndistributed. It turns out that one of the tools suited to tackle this\nheterogenous scenario has been introduced only recently namely, through the\nnotion of composite games. This paper exploits for the first time in the\nliterature of smart grids the notion of composite game and equilibrium. By\nassuming a rectangular charging profile for an EV, a composite equilibrium\nanalysis is conducted, followed by a detailed analysis of a case study which\nassumes three possible charging periods or time-slots. Both the provided\nanalytical and numerical results allow one to better understand the\nrelationship between the size (which is a measure) of the coalition and the\nnetwork sum-cost. In particular, a social dilemma, a situation where everybody\nprefers unilaterally defecting to cooperating, while the consequence is the\nworst for all, is exhibited.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures, keywords: EV charging - Electricity Distribution\n  Networks - Composite game - Composite Equilibrium"]}]

So far, work\nhas focused on Weyl semimetals with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However,\nWeyl semimetals with weak SOC may allow tunable spin-splitting for device\napplications and may exhibit a crossover to a spinless topological phase, such\nas a Dirac line semimetal in the case of spinless TaAs. NbP, isostructural to\nTaAs, may realize the first Weyl semimetal in the limit of weak SOC. Here we\nstudy the surface states of NbP by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) and we find that we $\\textit{cannot}$ show Fermi arcs based on our\nexperimental data alone. We present an $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculation of the\nsurface states of NbP and we find that the Weyl points are too close and the\nFermi level is too low to show Fermi arcs either by (1) directly measuring an\narc or (2) counting chiralities of edge modes on a closed path. Nonetheless,\nthe excellent agreement between our experimental data and numerical\ncalculations suggests that NbP is a Weyl semimetal, consistent with TaAs, and\nthat we observe trivial surface states which evolve continuously from the\ntopological Fermi arcs above the Fermi level. Based on these results, we\npropose a slightly different criterion for a Fermi arc which, unlike (1) and\n(2) above, does not require us to resolve Weyl points or the spin splitting of\nsurface states. We propose that raising the Fermi level by $> 20$ meV would\nmake it possible to observe a Fermi arc using this criterion in NbP.
