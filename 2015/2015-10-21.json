Temperature programmed\ndesorption (TPD) experiments were conducted for a wide range of C6H6 exposures,\nyielding information on both C6H6-SiO2 interactions and the C6H6-C6H6\ninteractions present in the bulk C6H6 ice. The low coverage experiments reveal\ncomplicated desorption behaviour that results both from porosity and roughness\nin the SiO2 substrate, and repulsive interactions between C6H6 molecules.\nKinetic parameters were obtained through a combination of direct analysis of\nthe TPD traces and kinetic modelling, demonstrating the coverage dependence of\nboth desorption energy and pre-exponential factor. Experiments were also\nperformed whereby the pores were blocked by pre-exposure of the SiO2 to water\nvapour. C6H6 was observed to be adsorbed preferentially on the SiO2 film not\ncovered by H2O at the temperature at which these experiments were performed.\nThis observation means that intermolecular repulsion likely becomes important\nat smaller C6H6 exposures on grains with a H2O mantle.

The progenitor models\nfor the SNIa available in the literature propose different distributions for\nregulating the explosion times of these events.

We find a good fit to both the present\nobserved SNIa rates in spheroidal dominated galaxies, and to the [O/Fe] ratios\nshown by the bulge of the Milky Way. Additionally, the SD scenario is found to\nreproduce a correlation between the specific SNIa rate and the specific star\nformation rate, which closely resembles the observational trend, at variance\nwith previous works.

This technique naturally accounts for degeneracies between\nnuisance parameters and can substantially reduce the dimension of the parameter\nspace that needs to be sampled. As a practical application, we apply PCA\nmarginalization to account for baryonic physics as an uncertainty in cosmic\nshear tomography.

In this paper, we show that measurements of positions and\ntime delays of strongly lensed images of a background galaxy, as well as those\nof the velocity dispersion and mass profile of a lens galaxy, can be combined\nto extract the angular diameter distance of the lens galaxy. Physically, as the\nvelocity dispersion and the time delay give a gravitational potential ($GM/r$)\nand a mass ($GM$) of the lens, respectively, dividing them gives a physical\nsize ($r$) of the lens. Comparing the physical size with the image positions of\na lensed galaxy gives the angular diameter distance to the lens. A mismatch\nbetween the exact locations at which these measurements are made can be\ncorrected by measuring a local slope of the mass profile. We expand on the\noriginal idea put forward by Paraficz and Hjorth, who analyzed singular\nisothermal lenses, by allowing for an arbitrary slope of a power-law spherical\nmass density profile, an external convergence, and an anisotropic velocity\ndispersion. We find that the effect of external convergence cancels out when\ndividing the time delays and velocity dispersion measurements. We derive a\nformula for the uncertainty in the angular diameter distance in terms of the\nuncertainties in the observables. As an application, we use two existing strong\nlens systems, B1608+656 ($z_{\\rm L}=0.6304$) and RXJ1131$-$1231 ($z_{\\rm\nL}=0.295$), to show that the uncertainty in the inferred angular diameter\ndistances is dominated by that in the velocity dispersion, $\\sigma^2$, and its\nanisotropy. We find that the current data on these systems should yield about\n16% uncertainty in $D_A$ per object. This improves to 13% when we measure\n$\\sigma^2$ at the so-called sweet-spot radius.

The library consist of 210 stars, with a total of 292 spectra,\ncovering the wavelength range of 0.94 to 2.41 micron at a resolution R = 2000.\nFor every star we infer the effective temperature (Teff), gravity (logg) and\nmetallicity ([Z/Zsun]) using a full-spectrum fitting approach in a section of\nthe K band (2.19 to 2.34 micron) and temperature-NIR colour relations. We test\nthe flux calibration of these stars by calculating their integrated colours and\ncomparing them with the Pickles library colour-temperature relations. We also\ninvestigate the NIR colours as a function of the calculated effective\ntemperature and compared them in colour-colour diagrams with the Pickles\nlibrary. This latter test shows a good broad-band flux calibration, important\nfor the SP models. Finally, we measure the resolution R as a function of\nwavelength. We find that the resolution increases as a function of lambda from\nabout 6 angstrom in J to 10 angstrom in the red part of the K-band. With these\ntests we establish that the IRTF library, the largest currently available\ngeneral library of stars at intermediate resolution in the NIR, is an excellent\ncandidate to be used in stellar population models.

The conservation of total frequency, or total\nprobability, shapes the characteristics of force. I begin with Fisher's\nfundamental theorem of natural selection. That theorem partitions the total\nevolutionary change of a population into two components. The first component is\nthe partial change caused by the direct force of natural selection, holding\nconstant all aspects of the environment. The second component is the partial\nchange caused by the changing environment. I demonstrate that Fisher's\npartition of total change into the direct force of selection and the forces\nfrom the changing environmental frame of reference is identical to d'Alembert's\nprinciple of mechanics, which separates the work done by the direct forces from\nthe work done by the inertial forces associated with the changing frame of\nreference. In d'Alembert's principle, there exist inertial forces from a change\nin the frame of reference that exactly balance the direct forces. I show that\nthe conservation of total probability strongly shapes the form of the balance\nbetween the direct and inertial forces. I then use the strong results for\nconserved probability to obtain general results for the change in any system\nquantity, such as biological fitness or energy. Those general results derive\nfrom simple coordinate changes between frequencies and system quantities.\nUltimately, d'Alembert's separation of direct and inertial forces provides deep\nconceptual insight into the interpretation of forces and the unification of\ndisparate fields of study.\n","Comment: version 2: New Methods section, revised throughout for minor\n  corrections and clarity, version 3: minor editing, publication information"]}]

We investigate how different star formation histories (SFHs) shape the\nfinal mass distribution of star clusters. We assume that every star cluster\npopulation forms during a formation epoch of length dt at a constant\nstar-formation rate (SFR). The mass distribution of such a population is\ndescribed by the embedded cluster mass function (ECMF), which is a pure power\nlaw extending to an upper limit M_max. Since the SFR determines M_max, the ECMF\nimplicitly depends on the SFR. Starting with different SFHs, each SFH is\ndivided into formation epochs of length dt at different SFRs. The requested\nmass function arises from the superposition of the star clusters of all\nformation epochs. An improved optimal sampling technique is introduced that\nallows generating number and mass distributions, both of which accurately agree\nwith the ECMF. Moreover, for each SFH the distribution function of all involved\nSFRs, F(SFR), is computed. For monotonically decreasing SFHs, F(SFR) always\nfollows a power law. With F(SFR), we develope the theory of the integrated\ngalactic embedded cluster mass function (IGECMF). It describes the distribution\nfunction of birth stellar masses of star clusters that accumulated over a\nformation episode much longer than dt. The IGECMF indeed reproduces the mass\ndistribution of star clusters created according to the superposition principle.\nInterestingly, all considered SFHs lead to a turn-down with increasing star\ncluster mass in their respective IGECMFs. In the past, a turn-down at the\nhigh-mass end has been observed for GC systems in different galaxy clusters and\nin the cluster initial mass function. This behavior can be explained naturally\nif the observed star cluster ensembles are superpositions of several individual\nstar cluster populations that formed at different times at different SFRs.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Such NLTE effects may be intensified or weakened by horizontal\nradiative transfer (RT) in a three-dimensionally (3-D) structured atmosphere.\nWe analyze the influence of horizontal RT on commonly used Fe I lines in a\nsnapshot of a 3-D radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a plage\nregion. NLTE- and horizontal RT effects occur with considerable strength (up to\n50% in line depth or equivalent width) in the analyzed snapshot. As they may\nhave either sign and both signs occur with approximately the same frequency and\nstrength, the net effects are small when considering spatially averaged\nquantities. The situation in the plage atmosphere turns out to be rather\ncomplex. Horizontal transfer leads to line-weakening relative to 1-D NLTE\ntransfer near the boundaries of kG magnetic elements. Around the centers of\nthese elements, however, we find an often significant line-strengthening. This\nbehavior is in contrast to that expected from previous 3-D RT computations in\nidealized flux-tube models, which display only a line weakening. The origin of\nthis unexpected behavior lies in the fact that magnetic elements are surrounded\nby dense and relatively cool down-flowing gas, which forms the walls of the\nmagnetic elements. The continuum in these dense walls is often formed in colder\ngas than in the central part of the magnetic elements. Consequently, the\ncentral parts of the magnetic element experience a sub-average UV-irradiation\nleading to the observed 3-D NLTE line strengthening.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

Our project\nhas greatly improved the statistics of the distribution of orbital periods,\nwhich is a good approximation of the distribution of cataclysmic variables at\nthe terminal evolutionary stage, and confirmed the presence of a period minimum\nat a period of 0.053 d and a period spike just above this period. The number\ndensity monotonically decreased toward the longer period and there was no\nstrong indication of a period gap. We detected possible negative superhumps in\nZ Cha. It is possible that normal outbursts are also suppressed by the presence\nof a disk tilt in this system. There was no indication of enhanced orbital\nhumps just preceding the superoutburst, and this result favors the\nthermal-tidal disk instability as the origin of superoutbursts. We detected\nsuperhumps in three AM CVn-type dwarf novae. Our observations and recent other\ndetections suggest that 8% of objects showing dwarf nova-type outbursts are AM\nCVn-type objects. AM CVn-type objects and EI Psc-type object may be more\nabundant than previously recognized. OT J213806, a WZ Sge-type object,\nexhibited a remarkably different feature between the 2010 and 2014\nsuperoutbursts. Although the 2014 superoutburst was much fainter the plateau\nphase was shorter than the 2010 one, the course of the rebrightening phase was\nsimilar. This object indicates that the O-C diagrams of superhumps can be\nindeed variable at least in WZ Sge-type objects. Four deeply eclipsing SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae (ASASSN-13cx, ASASSN-14ag, ASASSN-15bu, NSV 4618) were\nidentified.

The\nbrightening is due to emission in the blue wing of the Ca line, close to its\nknee. Non-LTE inversions reveal that the asymmetric emission is caused by a\ntemperature enhancement of about 700 K between -5.0<log tau<-3.0 and a\nblueshift of 3 km/s at log tau=-2.3. The photospheric blueshifts and redshifts\nseem to be caused by the emergence of a small-scale, flat Omega-loop with\nhighly inclined footpoints of opposite polarity. The gas motions detected in\nthe two footpoints are reminiscent of a siphon flow. The rising loop is\nprobably confined to the lower atmosphere by the overlying sunspot magnetic\nfield and the subsequent interaction may be responsible for temperature\nenhancements in the upper photosphere/lower chromosphere. This is the first\ntime that magnetic flux is observed to emerge in the strongly magnetised\nenvironment of sunspots, pushed upward by the convective flows of a granular\nlight bridge.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A: 11 pages, 11 figures, 1 movie"]}]

The fully developed homogeneous turbulence\nis studied in a number of numerical experiments. Results show that in both the\ncase of equal layer depths and surface intensified stratification an inverse\ncascade in kinetic energy is observed. The modal kinetic energy spectra for the\ncase with surface intensified stratification show higher energy for higher\nbaroclinic numbers at small scales, due to the decoupling of the layers. As a\nresult, while the case with equal layer depths shows large barotropic\ninstabilities with large scale gradients of potential temperature, the surface\nintensified stratification is characterized by a transition from surface\ndynamics, characterized by a patchy distribution of vorticity, to interior\ndynamics, characterized by vorticity filamentation. The effect of the\nshort-wave instabilities can be seen in the probability distribution functions\nof the potential vorticity anomaly, which reduces to a Gaussian distribution\nwhen the growth rate of the short-wave instabilities is larger than the growth\nrate for the long-wave instabilities. The surface intensified stratification\nalso alters the vertical structure of the potential vorticity fluxes and shows\ndeviations of the fluxes from a scaling obtained assuming that the turbulence\nacts as a downgradient diffusion.\n","Comment: 36 pages, 11 figures"]}]

The d.c. action of the memristor is a current spike which imparts a\nshort-term memory to the device. Here it is demonstrated that this short-term\nmemory works exactly like habituation (e.g. in \\emph{Aplysia}). We elucidate\nthe physical rules, based on energy conservation, governing the interaction of\nthese current spikes: summation, `bounce-back', directionality and `diminishing\nreturns'. Using these rules, we introduce 4 different logical systems to\nimplement sequential logic in the memristor and demonstrate how sequential\nlogic works by instantiating a NOT gate, an AND gate, an XOR gate and a Full\nAdder with a single memristor. The Full Adder makes use of the memristor's\nshort-term memory to add together three binary values and outputs the sum, the\ncarry digit and even the order they were input in. A memristor full adder also\noutputs the arithmetical sum of bits, allowing for a logically (but not\nphysically) reversible system. Essentially, we can replace an input/output port\nwith an extra time-step, allowing a single memristor to do a hither-to\nunexpectedly large amount of computation. This makes up for the memristor's\nslow operation speed and may relate to how neurons do a similarly-large\ncomputation with such slow operations speeds.

The second is\nthe possibility suggested by the data presented here, that climate change may\nlead to qualitatively different climate patterns, with a different relationship\nbetween e.g. strike frequency and temperature.\n","Comment: 10 figures"]}]
