A first approach to this\nidea is realized in Brunel's model the essence of which consists in the\nformation of an oscillating charge cloud in the vacuum in front of the target.\nThe investigation of statistical ensembles of orbits shows that the absorption\nprocess is localized at the ion-vacuum interface and in the skin layer: Single\nelectrons enter into resonance with the laser field thereby undergoing a phase\nshift which causes orbit crossing and braking of Brunel's laminar flow.

To date, introductions to\nthis theory have proved difficult for many readers to follow, but it depends\nmainly upon two relatively simple ideas: firstly that normative or teleological\nvalues can be expressed as probability distributions (active inference), and\nsecondly that approximate Bayesian reasoning can be effectively performed by\ngradient descent on model parameters (the free-energy principle). The notion of\nactive inference is of great interest for a number of disciplines including\ncognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive\nneuroscience, and deserves to be more widely known.\n  This paper attempts to provide an accessible introduction to active inference\nand informational free-energy, for readers from a range of scientific\nbackgrounds. In this work introduce an agent-based model with an agent trying\nto make predictions about its position in a one-dimensional discretized world\nusing methods from the FEP.\n"]}]

In this paper we highlight a number of features of\ngreat importance to librarians and discuss the additional functionality that we\nare currently developing. Starting in 2011, the ADS started to systematically\ncollect, parse and index full-text documents for all the major publications in\nPhysics and Astronomy as well as many smaller Astronomy journals and arXiv\ne-prints, for a total of over 3.5 million papers. Our citation coverage has\ndoubled since 2010 and now consists of over 70 million citations. We are\nnormalizing the affiliation information in our records and, in collaboration\nwith the CfA library and NASA, we have started collecting and linking funding\nsources with papers in our system. At the same time, we are undergoing major\ntechnology changes in the ADS platform which affect all aspects of the system\nand its operations. We have rolled out and are now enhancing a new\nhigh-performance search engine capable of performing full-text as well as\nmetadata searches using an intuitive query language which supports fielded,\nunfielded and functional searches. We are currently able to index\nacknowledgments, affiliations, citations, funding sources, and to the extent\nthat these metadata are available to us they are now searchable under our new\nplatform. The ADS private library system is being enhanced to support reading\ngroups, collaborative editing of lists of papers, tagging, and a variety of\nprivacy settings when managing one's paper collection. While this effort is\nstill ongoing, some of its benefits are already available through the ADS Labs\nuser interface and API at http://adslabs.org/adsabs/\n","Comment: Submitted to Library and Information Services in Astronomy VII,\n  Naples, Italy"]}]

Such modelling needs the spatial distribution of density,\nchemical abundances and temperature, that can be provided by chemo-dynamical\nsimulations (ChDS) of dwarf galaxies. We perform multicomponent photoionization\nmodelling (MPhM) of the ionized gas using 2-D ChDSs of dwarf galaxies. We\ncalculate emissivity maps for important nebular emission lines. Their\nintensities are used to derive the chemical abundance of oxygen by the\nso-called Te- and R23-methods. Some disagreements are found between oxygen\nabundances calculated with these methods and the ones coming from the ChDSs. We\ninvestigate the fraction of ionizing radiation emitted in the star-forming\nregion which is able to leak out the galaxy. The time- and direction-averaged\nescape fraction in our simulation is 0.35-0.4. Finally, we have calculated the\ntotal Halpha lumi- nosity of our model galaxy using Kennicutt's calibration to\nderive the star-formation rate. This value has been compared to the 'true' rate\nin the ChDSs. The Halpha-based star-formation rate agrees with the true one\nonly at the beginning of the simulation. Minor deviations arise later on and\nare due in part to the production of high-energy photons in the warm-hot gas,\nin part to the leakage of energetic photons out of the galaxy. The effect of\nartificially introduced thin dense shells (with thicknesses smaller than the\nChDSs spatial resolution) is investigated, as well.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 14 figures.
