Identifying invariant hyperplanes of the RG flow and\nclassifying their attractive/repulsive properties, we find evidence for\nemergent higher chiral symmetries as a function of Nf. For the case of the\nThirring model, we discover a new critical flavor number that separates the RG\nstable large-Nf regime from an intermediate-Nf regime in which\nsymmetry-breaking perturbations become RG relevant. This new critical flavor\nnumber has to be distinguished from the chiral-critical flavor number, below\nwhich the Thirring model is expected to allow spontaneous chiral symmetry\nbreaking, and its existence offers a resolution to the discrepancy between\nprevious results obtained in the continuum and the lattice Thirring models.\nMoreover, we find indications for a new feature of universality: details of the\ncritical behavior can depend on additional \"spectator symmetries\" that remain\nintact across the phase transition.

Our method, on the other hand, captures\nconformational information in-situ using local data only while reducing the\nstorage space needed for the part of the trajectory under consideration. This\nmethod processes the input trajectory data in one pass, breaks from the\ncentralized approach of traditional analysis, avoids the movement of trajectory\ndata, and still builds the global knowledge on the formation of individual\n$\\alpha$-helices or $\\beta$-strands as trajectory frames are generated.\n","Comment: 40 pages, 15 figures, this paper is presently in the format request\n  of the journal to which it was submitted for publication"]}]

Dendritic spines are\nmarkedly distinct in shape and size, and certain types of stimulation prompt\nspines to evolve, in fairly predictable fashion, from thin nascent morphologies\nto the mushroom-like shapes associated with mature spines. This striking\nprogression is coincident with the (re)configuration of the neuronal network\nduring early development, learning and memory formation, and has been\nconjectured to be part of the machinery that encodes these processes at the\nscale of individual neuronal connections.

Due to the vast number of environmental degrees of freedom, it is\nchallenging to accurately calculate decoherence times $T_2$, especially when\nthe qubit and environment are highly correlated.\n  Hybrid or mixed electron-nuclear spin qubits, such as donors in silicon,\npossess 'optimal working points' (OWPs) which are sweet-spots for reduced\ndecoherence in magnetic fields. Analysis of sharp variations of $T_2$ near OWPs\nwas previously based on insensitivity to classical noise, even though hybrid\nqubits are situated in highly correlated quantum environments, such as the\nnuclear spin bath of $^{29}$Si impurities. This presented limited understanding\nof the decoherence mechanism and gave unreliable predictions for $T_2$.\n  I present quantum many-body calculations of the qubit-bath dynamics, which\n(i) yield $T_2$ for hybrid qubits in excellent agreement with experiments in\nmultiple regimes, (ii) elucidate the many-body nature of the nuclear spin bath\nand (iii) expose significant differences between quantum-bath and\nclassical-field decoherence. To achieve these, the cluster correlation\nexpansion was adapted to include electron-nuclear state mixing. In addition, an\nanalysis supported by experiment was carried out to characterise the nuclear\nspin bath for a bismuth donor as the hybrid qubit, a simple analytical formula\nfor $T_2$ was derived with predictions in agreement with experiment, and the\nestablished method of dynamical decoupling was combined with operating near\nOWPs in order to maximise $T_2$. Finally, the decoherence of a $^{29}$Si spin\nin proximity to the hybrid qubit was studied, in order to establish the\nfeasibility for its use as a quantum register.\n","Comment: PhD thesis; University College London; 212 pages; pdf size ~ 13 MB;\n  http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1470543"]}]

When seeking to combine these material features\ninto QD structures, however, confinement can cause hybridization that inhibits\nthe robustness of these emergent properties for insertion into quantum devices.\nHere, we show that a new class of laterally-confined materials, monolayer\nMoS$_2$ QDs, can be created through top-down nanopatterning of an\natomically-thin two-dimensional semiconductor so that they exhibit the same\nvalley polarization as in a continuous monolayer sheet.\nSemiconductor-compatible nanofabrication process allows for these\nlow-dimensional materials to be integrated into complex systems, an important\nfeature for advancing quantum information applications. The inherited bulk spin\nand valley properties, the size dependence of excitonic energies, and the\nability to fabricate MoS$_2$ QDs using semiconductor-compatible processing\nsuggest that monolayer semiconductor QDs have the potential to be multimodal\nbuilding blocks of integrated quantum information and spintronics systems.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures"]}]

We analyzed\nthe spontaneous neural activity evolution in a hippocampal and a cortical\nnetwork over several weeks exploring whether the same PS coding mechanism\nappears in neuronal cultures as well. We show that self-organized neural in\nvitro networks not only develop characteristic bursting activity, but feature\nrobust in vivo-like PS activity. PS activity formed spatiotemporal patterns\nthat started at early days in vitro (DIVs) and lasted until the end of the\nrecording sessions. Initially random-like and sparse PS patterns became robust\nafter three weeks in vitro (WIVs). They were characterized by a high number of\noccurrences and short inter-paired spike intervals (IPSIs). Spatially, the\ndegree of complexity increased by recruiting new neighboring sites in PS as a\nculture matured. Moreover, PS activity participated in establishing functional\nconnectivity between different sites within the developing network. Employing\ntransfer entropy (TE) as an information transfer measure, we show that PS\nactivity is robustly involved in establishing effective connectivities. Spiking\nactivity at both individual sites and network level robustly followed each PS\nwithin a short time interval. PS may thus be considered a spiking predictor.\nThese findings suggest that PS activity is preserved in spontaneously active in\nvitro networks as part of a robust coding mechanism as encountered in vivo. We\nsuggest that, presumably in lack of any external sensory stimuli, PS may act as\nan internal surrogate stimulus to drive neural activity at different\ndevelopmental stages.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 9 figures; 2 supplementary pages, 2 supplementary figures"]}]
