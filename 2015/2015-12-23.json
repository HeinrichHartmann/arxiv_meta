This expulsion is accomplished by a spike instability that arises\nfrom superbubbles, when they break out of the galactic disc and their shell\nfragment. This leads to a {\\it cut } in the lines of force that still remain in\nthe disc. Subsequently, normal disc turbulence rotates the {\\it cut} lines and\nthus dissipates their mean flux removing them from a role in the dynamo theory.\nThis new process takes a length of time comparable, but a little longer than\nthe previous growth time of the disc dynamo, but avoids the previous\ndifficulties associated with flux-freezing and flux expulsion.\n","Comment: 30 pages 3 figures (JPP in Press)"]}]

Multiferroics are materials which\nexhibit electric and magnetic order simultaneously. Due to the coupling of\nelectric and magnetic effects, these materials show a strong potential to\ncontrol electricity and magnetism and, more generally, the properties and\npropagation of light. One of the most fascinating and counter-intuitive recent\nresults in multiferroics is directional anisotropy, the asymmetry of light\npropagation with respect to the direction of propagation. The absorption in the\nmaterial can be different for forward and backward propagation of light, which\nin extreme case may lead to complete suppression of absorption in one\ndirection. Another remarkable effect in multiferroics is directional\nbirefringence, i.e. different velocities of light for different directions of\npropagation. In this paper, we demonstrate giant directional birefringence in a\nmultiferroic samarium ferroborate. The effect is easily observed for linear\npolarization of light in the range of millimeter-wavelengths, and survives down\nto very low frequencies. The dispersion and absorption close to the\nelectromagnon resonance can be controlled and fully suppressed in one\ndirection. Therefore, samarium ferroborate is a universal tool for optical\ncontrol: with a magnetic field as an external parameter it allows switching\nbetween two functionalities: polarization rotation and directional anisotropy.\n","Comment: Corrected version.

This direct collapse process is a leading\ncandidate for rapid formation of supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds at high\nz. To circumvent the Courant condition at small radii, we have used the sink\nparticle method, and focus on the evolution on scales ~0.01-10 pc. The collapse\nproceeds in two stages, with the secondary runaway happening within the central\n10 pc, and with no detected fragmentation. The sink particles form when the\ncollapsing gas requires additional refinement of the grid size at the highest\nrefinement level. Their mass never exceeds ~10^3 Mo, with the sole exception of\nthe central seed which grows dramatically to ~ 2 x 10^6 Mo in ~2 Myr,\nconfirming the feasibility of this path to the SMBH. The time variability of\nangular momentum axis in the accreted gas results in the formation of two\nmisaligned disks --- a small inner disk, and a more massive, outer disk which\nis inclined by ~45^o to the inner disk. The self-gravity of these disks is\nheavily diluted --- both disks lie within the Roche limit of the central seed.\nWhile the inner disk is geometrically thin and weakly asymmetric, the outer\ndisk flares due to turbulent motions as a result of the massive inflow along a\npair of penetrating filaments. The geometry of inflow via filaments determines\nthe dominant and secondary Fourier modes in this disk --- these modes have a\nnon-self-gravitational origin. We do not confirm that m=1 is a principal mode\nthat drives the inflow in the presence of a central massive object. While the\npositions of the disks depend on the scale chosen to break the self-similar\ncollapse, the overall configuration appears to be generic, and is expected to\nform when the central seed becomes sufficiently massive.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 11 figures, MNRAS, in press, typos corrected"]}]

The inhomogeneous\nphotometric calibration between different SN samples is one of the largest\nsystematic uncertainties of the cosmological parameter estimation. To place\nthese different samples on a single system, analyses currently use observations\nof a small sample of very bright flux standards on the $HST$ system.

In particular, X-rays are very\nefficient at heating the IGM before it became completely ionized, an effect\nthat can be measured through the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen. High-mass\nX-ray binaries (HMXBs), known to be prolific X-ray sources in star-forming\ngalaxies at lower redshifts, are prime candidates for driving the thermal\nevolution of the IGM at redshifts $z > 20$. Despite their importance, the\nformation efficiency of HMXBs from the first stellar populations is not well\nunderstood---as such, their collective X-ray emission and the subsequent\nimprint on the 21 cm signature are usually evaluated using free parameters.\nUsing $N$-body simulations, we estimate the rate of HMXB formation via mutual\ngravitational interactions of nascent, small groups of the first stars (Pop III\nstars). We run two sets of calculations: one in which stars form in small\ngroups of five in nearly Keplerian initial orbits, and another in which two\nsuch groups collide (expected from mergers of host protogalaxies).

Due to the severe optical extinction in the inner Bulge region, only\na few detailed investigations have been performed of this region. Here we aim\nat investigating the inner 2 degrees by observing the [alpha/Fe] element trends\nversus metallicity, and by trying to derive the metallicity gradient.\n[alpha/Fe] and metallicities have been determined by spectral synthesis of 2\nmicron spectra observed with VLT/CRIRES of 28 M-giants, lying along the\nSouthern minor axis at (l,b)=(0,0), (0,-1), and (0,-2). VLT/ISAAC spectra are\nused to determine the effective temperature of the stars. We present the first\nconnection between the Galactic Center and the Bulge using similar stars, high\nspectral resolution, and analysis techniques. The [alpha/Fe] trends in all our\n3 fields show a large similarity among each other and with trends further out\nin the Bulge, with a lack of an [\\alpha/Fe] gradient all the way into the\ncentre. This suggests a homogeneous Bulge when it comes to the enrichment\nprocess and star-formation history. We find a large range of metallicities\n(-1.2<[Fe/H]<+0.3), with a lower dispersion in the Galactic center:\n-0.2<[Fe/H]<+0.3. The derived metallicities get in the mean, progressively\nhigher the closer to the Galactic plane they lie. We could interpret this as a\ncontinuation of the metallicity gradient established further out in the Bulge,\nbut due to the low number of stars and possible selection effects, more data of\nthe same sort as presented here is necessary to conclude on the inner\nmetallicity gradient from our data alone. Our results firmly argues for the\ncenter being in the context of the Bulge rather than very distinct.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in AJ"]}]

As we demonstrate,\nthe effects of a Type IV singularity appear in the Hubble flow parameters,\nwhich determine the dynamical evolution of the cosmological system. So we study\nvarious inflation models incorporating a Type IV singularity, with the\nsingularity occurring at the end of inflation.

As we evince,\nsome of the Hubble flow parameters become singular at the singularity, an\neffect which indicates that at that point a dynamical instability occurs. This\ndynamical instability eventually indicates the graceful exit from inflation. We\ndemonstrate that the toy model has an unstable de Sitter point at the\nsingularity, so indeed graceful exit could be triggered. In the case of the\nsingular inflation model, graceful exit proceeds in the standard way.

The presence of dust can have a strong impact on the chemical\ncomposition of molecular clouds. While observations show that many species that\nformed onto dust grains populate the gas phase, the process that transforms\nsolid state into gas phase remains unclear. Aims. The aim of this paper is to\nconsider the chemical desorption process, i.e. the process that releases solid\nspecies into the gas phase, in astrochemical models. These models allow\ndetermining the chemical composition of star-forming environments with an\naccurate treatment of the solid-phase chemistry. Methods. In paper I we derived\na formula based on experimental studies with which we quantified the\nefficiencies of the chemical desorption process.

The simulations of astrophysical\nenvironments show that the abundances of gas-phase methanol and H2O2 increase\nby four orders of magnitude, whereas gas-phase H2CO and HO2 increase by one\norder of magnitude when the chemical desorption process is taken into account.\nThe composition of the ices strongly varies when the chemical desorption is\nconsidered or neglected.

Moreover: (i) the peak rail capacity of Port Botany is 1.78\nmillion TEU per annum; over six times higher than 2011/12 rail volumes; (ii)\nthere are no infrastructural impediments to the achievement of peak rail\ncapacity; (iii) operational changes, not infrastructural investment, are the\nkey to unlocking the potential of the port; (iv) Port Botany is well positioned\nto handle projected increases in container volumes over the next decade and\nbeyond, including the 28% rail mode share target established by the New South\nWales State Government.\n"]}]

In Paper~I, we presented the optimal ways to coadd images in order to\ndetect faint sources and to perfrom flux measurements under the assumption that\nthe noise is approximately Gaussian. Here, we build on these results and derive\nfrom first principles a coaddition technique which is optimal for any\nhypothesis testing and measurement (e.g., source detection, flux or shape\nmeasurements and star/galaxy separation), in the background-noise-dominated\ncase. This method has several important properties. The pixels of the resulting\ncoadd image are uncorrelated. This image preserves all the information (from\nthe original individual images) on all spatial frequencies. Any hypothesis\ntesting or measurement that can be done on all the individual images\nsimultaneously, can be done on the coadded image without any loss of\ninformation. The PSF of this image is typically as narrow, or narrower than the\nPSF of the best image in the ensemble. Moreover, this image is practically\nindistinguishable from a regular single image, meaning that any code that\nmeasures any property on a regular astronomical image can be applied to it\nunchanged. In particular, the optimal source detection statistic derived in\npaper~I is reproduced by matched filtering this image with its own PSF. This\ncoaddition process, which we call proper coaddition, can be understood as a the\nmaximum signal-to-noise ratio measurement of the Fourier transform of the\nimage, weighted in such a way that the noise in the entire Fourier domain is of\nequal variance. This method has important implications for multi-epoch\nseeing-limited deep surveys, weak lensing galaxy shape measurements, and\ndiffraction-limited imaging via speckle observations.

While in that work positive assumptions for both facts and rules can\noccur in the premise, negative assumptions are not allowed. In this work, we\ncover this subject by introducing a new concept: a restricted predicate, which\nallows negative assumptions by pruning the usual semantics of a predicate. This\nnew setting has been implemented in the deductive system DES.\n","Comment: In Proceedings PROLE 2015, arXiv:1512.06178"]}]

Informally,\nidentities are used for tackling two of the fundamental difficulties that\nareinherent to deterministic distributed computing, namely: (1) symmetry\nbreaking, and (2) topological information gathering. In the context of local\ncomputation, i.e., when nodes can gather information only from nodes at bounded\ndistances, some insight regarding the role of identities has been established.\nFor instance, it was shown that, for large classes of construction problems,\nthe role of the identities can be rather small. However, for theidentities to\nplay no role, some other kinds of mechanisms for breaking symmetry must be\nemployed, such as edge-labeling or sense of direction. When it comes to local\ndistributed decision problems, the specification of the decision task does not\nseem to involve symmetry breaking. Therefore, it is expected that, assuming\nnodes can gather sufficient information about their neighborhood, one could get\nrid of the identities, without employing extra mechanisms for breaking\nsymmetry. We tackle this question in the framework of the $\\local$ model. Let\n$\\LD$ be the class of all problems that can be decided in a constant number of\nrounds in the $\\local$ model. Similarly, let $\\LD^*$ be the class of all\nproblems that can be decided at constant cost in the anonymous variant of the\n$\\local$ model, in which nodes have no identities, but each node can get access\nto the (anonymous) ball of radius $t$ around it, for any $t$, at a cost of $t$.\nIt is clear that $\\LD^*\\subseteq \\LD$. We conjecture that $\\LD^*=\\LD$. In this\npaper, we give several evidences supporting this conjecture. In particular, we\nshow that it holds for hereditary problems, as well as when the nodes know an\narbitrary upper bound on the total number of nodes. Moreover, we prove that the\nconjecture holds in the context of non-deterministic local decision, where\nnodes are given certificates (independent of the identities, if they exist),\nand the decision consists in verifying these certificates. In short, we prove\nthat $\\NLD^*=\\NLD$.\n","Comment: Principles of Distributed Systems, 16th International Conference, Dec\n  2012, Rome, Italy"]}]

Our goal is to reprove this\nassertion in the case of points in projective spaces (as asked in\n\\cite{PAGII}*{Example 11.3.5}) without recurring to deep methods of algebraic\ngeometry. Instead of working with subsets of projective space, we will\nconcentrate on the affine cones over them; our aim hence becomes to understand\nsymbolic and ordinary powers ideals of sets of line through the origin. We will\nend up reducing the general case to a study of the ideals \\[ I_{2,n}\n=(x_ix_j\\mid 1\\leq i<j\\leq n) \\subseteq k[x_1,\\dots,x_n] \\] defining the union\nof coordinate axes in $\\AA^n_{k}$. We work over an arbitrary field $k$. Our\nmain result is as follows. Let $\\Sigma\\subseteq P^{n-1}$ be a set of $n$ points\nnot lying in a hyperplane. Then \\[\n  S_{\\Sigma}^{(\\lceil (2-\\frac{2}{n})m \\rceil) } \\subseteq S^m_{\\Sigma} \\] for\nall positive integers $m$. If $n=3$, then the same statement holds for three\ndistinct points in arbitrary position.\n","Comment: 5 pages"]}]

We introduce the notion of an adelic amoeba for varieties over\nglobal fields, and establish a form of the local-global principle for them.\nThis principle is used to explain the calculation of the nonexpansive set for a\nrelated dynamical system.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 2 figures.
