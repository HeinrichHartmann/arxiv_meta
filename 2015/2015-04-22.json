The first is that the measured\ndark-matter relic density can be satisfied with new physics at O(100 GeV - 1\nTeV), while the null results from direct-detection experiments place lower\nbounds of O(10 TeV) on a new-physics scale. The second puzzle is that the\nsevere suppression of lepton-flavor-violating processes involving electrons,\ne.g. mu->3e, tau->e mu mu, etc., implies that generic new-physics contributions\nto lepton interactions cannot exist below O(10 - 100 TeV), whereas the 3.6sigma\ndeviation of the muon g-2 from the standard model can be explained by a\nnew-physics scale < O(1 TeV).

We consider the possibility of a gauged lepton-flavor\ninteraction that couples at tree level only to mu- and tau-flavored leptons and\nthe dark sector. Dark matter thus interacts appreciably only with particles of\nmu and tau flavor at tree level and has loop-suppressed couplings to quarks and\nelectrons. Remarkably, if such a gauged flavor interaction exists at a scale\nO(100 GeV - 1 TeV), it allows for a consistent phenomenological framework,\ncompatible with the muon g-2, the relic density, direct detection, indirect\ndetection, charged-lepton decays, neutrino trident production, and results from\nhadron and e+e- colliders.

METHODS: Using high-resolution spectra obtained with MIKE, FEROS,\nSOFIN, FIES, UVES and HARPS spectrographs, we determine Sc, V, Mn, and Co\nabundances for a large sample of F and G dwarfs in Solar neighbourhood. The\nmethod is based on spectral synthesis and using one-dimensional (1-D),\nplane-parallel, LTE model stellar atmospheres calculated with the MARCS 2012\ncode.

RESULTS: We\nfind that the abundance trends derived for Sc (594 stars), V (466 stars), and\nCo (567 stars) are very similar to what has been observed for the\nalpha-elements in the thin and thick disks. On the contrary Mn (569 stars) is\ngenerally underabundant relative to the Sun (i.e. [Mn/Fe]<0) for [Fe/H]<0.\nAlso, for Mn, when NLTE corrections are applied, the trend changes and is\nalmost flat over the entire metallicity range that the stars in our sample span\n(-2<[Fe/H]<+0.4). The [Sc/Fe]-[Fe/H] abundance trends show a small separation\nbetween the thin and thick disks, while for V and Co they completely overlap.\nFor Mn there is a small difference in [Mn/Fe] but only when NLTE corrections\nare used.

In two and three\ndimensions, the Z2 phases have a surface consistent with the nonsymmorphic\nspace group symmetry, and thus they support topological gapless surface states.\nRemarkably, the surface states have a unique energy dispersion with the Mobius\ntwist, which identifies the Z2 phases experimentally.

Although oxygen is an important tracer of Galactic chemical\nevolution, measurements of its abundance in the atmospheres of the oldest\nGalactic stars are still scarce and rather imprecise. At the lowest end of the\nmetallicity scale, oxygen can only be measured in giant stars and in most of\ncases such measurements rely on a single forbidden [O I] 630 nm line that is\nvery weak and frequently blended with telluric lines. Although molecular OH\nlines located in the ultraviolet and infrared could also be used for the\ndiagnostics, oxygen abundances obtained from the OH lines and the [O I] 630 nm\nline are usually discrepant to a level of ~0.3-0.4 dex. Aims. We study the\ninfluence of convection on the formation of the infrared (IR) OH lines and the\nforbidden [O I] 630 nm line in the atmospheres of extremely metal-poor (EMP)\nred giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution and high signal-to-noise\nratio spectra of four EMP red giant stars obtained with the VLT CRIRES\nspectrograph. For each EMP star, 4-14 IR OH vibrational-rotational lines\nlocated in the spectral range of 1514-1548 and 1595-1632 nm were used to\ndetermine oxygen abundances by employing standard 1D LTE abundance analysis\nmethodology.

We find that the\ninfluence of convection on the formation of [O I] 630 nm line in the\natmospheres of EMP giants studied here is minor, which leads to very small\n3D-1D abundance corrections (< -0.01 dex). On the contrary, IR OH lines are\nstrongly affected by convection and thus the abundance corrections for these\nlines are significant, 3D-1D ~ -0.2 ... -0.3 dex.

There are many uncertainties involved in modelling the\nevolution and nucleosynthesis of AGB stars, and this is especially the case at\nlow metallicity, where most of the stars with high enough masses to enter the\nAGB have evolved to become white dwarfs and can no longer be observed. The\nstellar population in the Galactic halo is of low mass ($\\lesssim\n0.85M_{\\odot}$) and only a few observed stars have evolved beyond the first\ngiant branch. However, we have evidence that low-metallicity AGB stars in\nbinary systems have interacted with their low-mass secondary companions in the\npast. The aim of this work is to investigate AGB nucleosynthesis at low\nmetallicity by studying the surface abundances of chemically peculiar very\nmetal-poor stars of the halo observed in binary systems. To this end we select\na sample of 15 carbon- and $s$-element-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP-$s$) halo\nstars that are found in binary systems with measured orbital periods.

As probably less than 0.2 Jy of the flux from Sgr\nA* can be attributed to accretion from G2, one finds an effective accretion\nrate eta*Mdot < 1.5*10^9 kg/s ~ 7.7*10^-9 Mearth/yr for material from G2.\nExploiting the kinetic jet power--accretion power relation of radio galaxies,\none finds that the rate of accretion of matter that ends up in jets is limited\nto Mdot < 10^17 kg/s ~ 0.5 Mearth/yr, less than about 20% of the mass of G2.\nAccordingly, G2 appears to be largely stable against loss of angular momentum\nand subsequent (partial) accretion at least on time scales < 1 year.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table; A&A Letter, in press (submitted 2015\n  February 26; accepted 2015 March 31)"]}]

A Maple program devel- oped earlier is implemented to\ndetermine the stability of limit cycles bifurcating from the Hopf bifurcation.\nNumerical simulations are presented to illustrate phenomena of interest such as\nbistability, recurrence and oscillation. We also discuss the physical\nmotivations for the models and the clinical implications of the resulting\ndynamics.\n","Comment: 28 pages, 5 figures"]}]

We make\nseveral major contributions: (i) we derive an important theoretical result\nwhich shows that the change in the quantile of a stream is constrained\nregardless of the stochastic properties of data, (ii) we describe a set of\nhigh-level design goals for an effective estimation algorithm that emerge as a\nconsequence of our theoretical findings, (iii) we introduce a novel algorithm\nwhich implements the aforementioned design goals by retaining a sample of data\nvalues in a manner adaptive to changes in the distribution of data and\nprogressively narrowing down its focus in the periods of quasi-stationary\nstochasticity, and (iv) we present a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed\nalgorithm and compare it with the existing methods in the literature on both\nsynthetic data sets and three large `real-world' streams acquired in the course\nof operation of an existing commercial surveillance system. Our findings\nconvincingly demonstrate that the proposed method is highly successful and\nvastly outperforms the existing alternatives, especially when the target\nquantile is high valued and the available buffer capacity severely limited.\n","Comment: International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2015"]}]

Single-domain protein side-chain\npacking has been thoroughly studied. A major challenge in generalizing these\nmethods to protein complexes is that they, unlike monomers, often have very\nlarge treewidth, and thus algorithms such as TreePack cannot be directly\napplied. To address this issue, SCWRL4 treats the complex effectively as a\nmonomer, heuristically excluding weak interactions to decrease treewidth; as a\nresult, SCWRL4 generates poor packings on protein interfaces. To date, few\nside-chain packing methods exist that are specifically designed for protein\ncomplexes. In this paper, we introduce a method, iTreePack, which solves the\nside-chain packing problem for complexes by using a novel combination of dual\ndecomposition and tree decomposition. In particular, iTreePack overcomes the\nproblem of large treewidth by decomposing a protein complex into smaller\nsubgraphs and novelly reformulating the complex side-chain packing problem as a\ndual relaxation problem; this allows us to solve the side-chain packing of each\nsmall subgraph separately using tree-decomposition. A projected subgradient\nalgorithm is applied to enforcing the consistency among the side-chain packings\nof all the small subgraphs. Computational results demonstrate that our\niTreePack program outperforms SCWRL4 on protein complexes. In particular,\niTreePack places side-chain atoms much more accurately on very large complexes,\nwhich constitute a significant portion of protein-protein interactions.\nMoreover, the advantage of iTreePack over SCWRL4 increases with respect to the\ntreewidth of a complex. Even for monomeric proteins, iTreePack is much more\nefficient than SCWRL and slightly more accurate.\n"]}]

We present the first polylogarithmic\nspace $O(1)$-approximation to the metric $k$-median and metric $k$-means\nproblems in the sliding window model, answering the main open problem posed by\nBabcock, Datar, Motwani and O'Callaghan, which has remained unanswered for over\na decade. Our algorithm uses $O(k^3 \\log^6 n)$ space and\n$\\operatorname{poly}(k, \\log n)$ update time. This is an exponential\nimprovement on the space required by the technique due to Babcock, et al. We\nintroduce a data structure that extends smooth histograms as introduced by\nBraverman and Ostrovsky to operate on a broader class of functions. In\nparticular, we show that using only polylogarithmic space we can maintain a\nsummary of the current window from which we can construct an $O(1)$-approximate\nclustering solution.\n  Merge-and-reduce is a generic method in computational geometry for adapting\noffline algorithms to the insertion-only streaming model. Several well-known\ncoreset constructions are maintainable in the insertion-only streaming model\nusing this method, including well-known coreset techniques for the $k$-median,\n$k$-means in both low-and high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Previous work has\nadapted these techniques to the insertion-deletion model, but translating them\nto the sliding window model has remained a challenge. We give the first\nalgorithm that, given an insertion-only streaming coreset construction of space\n$s$, maintains a $(1\\pm\\epsilon)$-approximate coreset in the sliding window\nmodel using $O(s^2\\epsilon^{-2}\\log n)$ space.\n  For clustering problems, our results constitute the first significant step\ntowards resolving problem number 20 from the List of Open Problems in Sublinear\nAlgorithms.\n"]}]
