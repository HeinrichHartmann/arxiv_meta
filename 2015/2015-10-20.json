As an example we write down the most general theory of\ndissipative fluids consistent with the second law in curved non-relativistic\ngeometries and find significant differences in the allowed transport\ncoefficients from those found previously. Kubo formulas for all response\ncoefficients are presented. Our approach also immediately generalizes to\nsystems with independent mass and charge currents as would arise in\nmulticomponent fluids. Along the way we also discuss how to write general\nlocally Galilean invariant non-relativistic actions for multiple particle\nspecies at any order in derivatives. A detailed review of the geometry and its\nrelation to non-relativistic limits may be found in a companion paper\n[arXiv:1503.02682].\n","Comment: Reference added. 44 pages"]}]

Because biological evolution\nis an example of trial and error and not a simple causation, there may be\nmultiple answers to the evolution of bipedalism. The postural feeding\nhypothesis (reaching for food/balancing) provides an explanation for the\npartial bipedalism of the earliest hominins.

In this case the classical expressions for the Casimir\nfree energy and pressure are common for both configurations considered. If the\nplasma model approach is used, the classical limit is not achieved for any film\nthickness. Instead, the Casimir free energy and pressure are decreasing\nexponentially to zero. When the plasma frequency goes to infinity, the Casimir\nfree energy obtained using the Drude model approach goes to a nonzero limit in\ncontradiction with expectations. If the plasma model approach is used the free\nenergy of metallic film goes to zero in the limit of infinitely large plasma\nfrequency. All analytic results are accompanied by numerical computations\nperformed for a Au film and sapphire plates. The possibilities to observe the\npredicted effects discriminating between the Drude and plasma model approaches\nare discussed.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 6 figures; to appear in Phys. Rev. A"]}]

In this respect,\nefficiently decodable deterministic coding schemes which achieve capacity\nprovably have been elusive until as recent as 2008, even though schemes which\ncome close to it in practice existed. This survey tries to give the interested\nreader an overview of the area.\n  Erdal Arikan came up with his landmark polar coding shemes which achieve\ncapacity on symmetric channels subject to the constraint that the input\ncodewords are equiprobable. His idea is to convert any B-DMC into efficiently\nencodable-decodable channels which have rates 0 and 1, while conserving\ncapacity in this transformation. An exponentially decreasing probability of\nerror which independent of code rate is achieved for all rates lesser than the\nsymmetric capacity. These codes perform well in practice since encoding and\ndecoding complexity is O(N log N). Guruswami et al. improved the above results\nby showing that error probability can be made to decrease doubly exponentially\nin the block length.\n  We also study recent results by Urbanke et al. which show that 2-transitive\ncodes also achieve capacity on erasure channels under MAP decoding. Urbanke and\nhis group use complexity theoretic results in boolean function analysis to\nprove that EXIT functions, which capture the error probability, have a sharp\nthreshold at 1-R, thus proving that capacity is achieved. One of the oldest and\nmost widely used codes - Reed Muller codes are 2-transitive.

It is also\nimplemented in mainstream dense linear algebra libraries. However, we note that\ntheoretical study of the parallelism of this algorithm is currently lacking. In\nthis paper, we present new theoretical results about the tiled Cholesky\nfactorization in the context of a parallel homogeneous model without\ncommunication costs. We use standard flop-based weights for the tasks. For a\n$t$-by-$t$ matrix, we know that the critical path of the tiled Cholesky\nalgorithm is $9t-10$ and that the weight of all tasks is $t^3$. In this\ncontext, we prove that no schedule with less than $0.185 t^2$ processing units\ncan finish in a time less than the critical path. In perspective, a naive bound\ngives $0.11 t^2.$ We then give a schedule which needs less than $0.25\nt^2+0.16t+3$ processing units to complete in the time of the critical path. In\nperspective, a naive schedule gives $0.50 t^2.$ In addition, given a fixed\nnumber of processing units, $p$, we give a lower bound on the execution time as\nfollows: $$\\max( \\frac{t^{3}}{p}, \\frac{t^{3}}{p} - 3\\frac{t^2}{p} + 6\\sqrt{2p}\n- 7 , 9t-10).$$ The interest of the latter formula lies in the middle term. Our\nresults stem from the observation that the tiled Cholesky factorization is much\nbetter behaved when we schedule it with an ALAP (As Late As Possible) heuristic\nthan an ASAP (As Soon As Possible) heuristic. We also provide scheduling\nheuristics which match closely the lower bound on execution time. We believe\nthat our theoretical results will help practical scheduling studies.

The MF technique utilizes\nthe latent factor model to obtain static user preferences (user latent vectors)\nand item characteristics (item latent vectors) based on historical rating data.\nHowever, in the real world user preferences are not static but full of\ndynamics. Though there are several previous works that addressed this time\nvarying issue of user preferences, it seems (to the best of our knowledge) that\nnone of them is specifically designed for tracking concept drift in individual\nuser preferences. Motivated by this, we develop a Temporal Matrix Factorization\napproach (TMF) for tracking concept drift in each individual user latent\nvector. There are two key innovative steps in our approach: (i) we develop a\nmodified stochastic gradient descent method to learn an individual user latent\nvector at each time step, and (ii) by the Lasso regression we learn a linear\nmodel for the transition of the individual user latent vectors. We test our\nmethod on a synthetic dataset and several real datasets. In comparison with the\noriginal MF, our experimental results show that our temporal method is able to\nachieve lower root mean square errors (RMSE) for both the synthetic and real\ndatasets. One interesting finding is that the performance gain in RMSE is\nmostly from those users who indeed have concept drift in their user latent\nvectors at the time of prediction. In particular, for the synthetic dataset and\nthe Ciao dataset, there are quite a few users with that property and the\nperformance gains for these two datasets are roughly 20% and 5%, respectively.\n"]}]

The system then splits the application and as a result\ndelivers two instrumented applications ready for distribution across devices.\nDuring runtime, the system uses a mirroring phase to maintain the functionality\nof the distributed application and to support a dynamic splitting process.\nDeveloped as a Chrome extension, our approach is validated on several web\napplications, including a YouTube page and a video application from Mozilla.\n"]}]

This assertion was conjectured by B. Jonsson in the 1960's\nand proven by J.B. Nation in 1980. However, there is a desire for a new proof\nto this deep result as Nation's proof is very involved and more insight into\nsublattices of free lattices is sought after.\n  In this article, a sufficient condition involving a construct known as a join\nminimal pair, or just a minimal pair, implying J'onsson's conjecture is proven.\nMinimal pairs were first defined by H. Gaskill when analysing sharply\ntransferable lattices. Using this sufficient condition, research by I.Rival and\nB.Sands is used to compare this condition with properties of finite\nsemidistributive lattices and in the process refute the main assertion of a\nmanuscript by H.Muhle. Moreover, inspired by the approaches used by Henri\nMuhle, I will make a partial result which investigates a possible forbidden\nsublattice characterization involving breadth-two planar semidistributive\nlattices.

Based on the\nobservation that smoothness or textures within an image patch corresponds to\nsparse spectral components in the frequency domain, ALOHA exploits the\nexistence of annihilating filters and the associated rank-deficient Hankel\nmatrices in the image domain to estimate the missing pixels. By extending this\nidea, here we propose a novel impulse noise removal algorithm using sparse +\nlow rank decomposition of an annihilating filter-based Hankel matrix. The new\napproach, what we call the robust ALOHA, is motivated by the observation that\nan image corrupted with impulse noises has intact pixels; so the impulse noises\ncan be modeled as sparse components, whereas the underlying image can be still\nmodeled using a low-rank Hankel structured matrix. To solve the sparse + low\nrank decomposition problem, we propose an alternating direction method of\nmultiplier (ADMM) method with initial factorized matrices coming from low rank\nmatrix fitting (LMaFit) algorithm. To adapt the local image statistics that\nhave distinct spectral distributions, the robust ALOHA is applied patch by\npatch.

The authors consider a particular\nsystem---multiple vesicles suspended in a periodic channel of arbitrary\nshape---to describe the numerical method and test its performance. Rather than\nrelying on the periodic Green's function as classical BIE methods do, the\nmethod combines the free-space Green's function with a small auxiliary basis,\nand imposes periodicity as an extra linear condition. As a result, we can\nexploit existing free-space solver libraries, quadratures, and fast algorithms,\nand handle a large number of vesicles in a geometrically complex channel.\nSpectral accuracy in space is achieved using the periodic trapezoid rule and\nproduct quadratures, while a first-order semi-implicit scheme evolves particles\nby treating the vesicle-channel interactions explicitly. New\nconstraint-correction formulas are introduced that preserve reduced areas of\nvesicles, independent of the number of time steps taken. By using two types of\nfast algorithms, (i) the fast multipole method (FMM) for the computation of the\nvesicle-vesicle and the vesicle-channel hydrodynamic interaction, and (ii) a\nfast direct solver for the BIE on the fixed channel geometry, the computational\ncost is reduced to $O(N)$ per time step where $N$ is the spatial discretization\nsize. Moreover, the direct solver inverts the wall BIE operator at $t = 0$,\nstores its compressed representation and applies it at every time step to\nevolve the vesicle positions, leading to dramatic cost savings compared to\nclassical approaches.

In the same time,\nsome of their components are unstable in the temperature and pressure regimes\nof central regions of giant planets and only ab-initio EOS computations can\naddress the question of the state of matter. In this framework, several works\ndemonstrated that erosion and redistribution of core materials in the envelope\nmust be taken into account. These complex mechanisms thus may deeply modify\ngiant planet interiors for which signatures of strong tidal dissipation have\nbeen obtained for Jupiter and Saturn. The best candidates to explain this\ndissipation are the viscoelastic dissipation in the central dense core and\nturbulent friction acting on tidal inertial waves in their fluid convective\nenvelope. In this work, we study the consequences of the possible melting of\ncentral regions for the efficiency of each of these mechanisms.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 2 figures, Proceedings of the SF2A 2015 conference"]}]

The model described here is based on results from Quantum Field\nMechanics, according to which all fundamental particles and interactions\noriginate from the interaction of two pre-space/pre-time protofields. In\ncontrast with the Standard Model, (virtual) interaction-particles are absent in\nthe description of any of the four fundamental interactions. Electrons perform\na single quantum beat process while mesons and baryons have, respectively, two\nand three bound quantum beat processes. Quantum Field Mechanics suggests that\nthe charge of an electron and positron can be identified with the two possible\nphases of a quantum beat process as observed in the electromagnetic protofield.\nThis report assumes that short-range binding interaction between quantum beat\nprocesses has a masking effect on the externally observable charge of hadrons.\nUsing this assumption, the internal structure of particles is derived from\ntheir known particle charges and relative masses. The particle structures are\nused to obtain the so-called charge-quantum phase law. The fractional charge of\nquantum beat processes inside a particle is deduced by rewriting the\ncharge-quantum phase law in terms of a linear combination of charge\ncontributions of individual constituent quantum beat processes. Strangeness and\nisospin are mathematically defined in terms of the quantum beat phases of sets\nof particles of the same type. Application of conservation laws to particle\nprocesses leads to relations between quantum phase, strangeness and isospin.\n","Comment: renamed to better reflect content and rewritten, eliminated split\n  tables, 32 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables, pdf Withdraw due to new insights in\n  the nature of fundamental particles"]}]
