A goniopolarimetric inversion was applied\nto RPWS 3-antenna electric measurements to determine the wave vector k and the\ncomplete state of polarization of detected waves.

The longitudinal and transverse Langevin\ndiffusion coefficients depend strongly on the anisotropy, the direction of\nmotion and the transverse direction considered. We analyze the anisotropy\neffects to the coefficients and compare them to each other and to them of the\nisotropic theory. To examine the dependence of the coefficients on the type of\nthe geometry, we consider another bottom-up anisotropic model. Changing the\ngeometry from prolate to oblate, certain diffusion coefficients interchange\ntheir behaviors. In both anisotropic backgrounds we find cases that the\ntransverse diffusion coefficient is larger than the longitudinal, but we find\nno negative excess noise.\n","Comment: 1+25 pages, 17 figures"]}]

In order to\ncharacterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physical\nconditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of the\nentire sample of 61 galaxies from Key Insights into Nearby Galaxies:\nFar-Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH). The main goal of our work is the\ncharacterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellar\nradiation fields responsible for heating the dust. After fitting the dust and\nstellar radial profiles with exponential functions, we fit the far-infrared\nspectral energy distribution (SED) in each annular region with\nsingle-temperature modified black bodies using both variable (MBBV) and fixed\n(MBBF) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dust\nmodels. Results show that while most SED parameters decrease with radius, the\nemissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but in\nothers is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outer\nones. Despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta~ 2.1) of the\nphysically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectral\nslopes with beta<= 1. We find that flatter slopes (beta<= 1.5) are associated\nwith cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usual\nTdust-beta degeneracy. This trend is related to variations in Umin since beta\nand Umin are very closely linked over the entire range in Umin sampled by the\nKINGFISH galaxies: low Umin is associated with flat beta<=1. Both these results\nstrongly suggest that the low apparent \\beta values (flat slopes) in MBBV fits\nare caused by temperature mixing along the line-of-sight, rather than by\nintrinsic variations in grain properties.

Accordingly, we explore the time evolution and the dynamical\ncharacteristics of a spatially-flat cosmological model, in which, in principle,\nthere is no DE at all. Instead, in this model, the DM itself possesses some\nsort of fluid-like properties, i.e., the fundamental units of the Universe\nmatter-energy content are the volume elements of a DM fluid, performing\npolytropic flows. In this case, the energy of this fluid's internal motions is\nalso taken into account as a source of the universal gravitational field. This\nform of energy can compensate for the extra energy needed to compromise spatial\nflatness, namely, to justify that, today, the total-energy density parameter is\nexactly unity. The polytropic cosmological model, depends on only one free\nparameter, the corresponding exponent, \\Gamma.

Spectral fitting of neutron star atmosphere models to the\nthermal component is one of the leading methods for measuring the neutron star\nradius. However, it has been known for years that the X-ray spectra of\nquiescent neutron stars vary between observations. While most quiescent\nvariability is explained through a variable power-law component, the brightest\nand best-studied object, Cen X-4, requires a change in the thermal component\nand such thermal variability could be a problem for measuring neutron star\nradii. In this paper, we significantly increase the number of sources whose\nquiescent spectra have been studied for variability. We examine 9 potential\nquiescent neutron stars with luminosities <1E34 erg/s over the course of\nmultiple Chandra observations of the globular clusters NGC 6440 and Terzan 5\nand find no strong evidence for variability in the effective temperature in 7\nof the 9 sources. Two sources show a potential change in temperature, though\nthis depends on the exact model fitted. CX1 in NGC 6440 is equally well fit by\na variable thermal component or a variable power law. Therefore, the results\nare inconclusive and we cannot exclude or require thermal variability in that\nsource. CX5 in NGC 6440 shows a potential change in temperature, though this\ndepends on whether a power-law is included in the spectral fit or not. This\nsuggests that thermal variability may not be widespread among quiescent neutron\nstars with luminosities < 1E34 erg/s, and hence thermal radiation remains a\npromising means to constraining neutron star radii.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables, resubmitted to MNRAS after addressing\n  referee's comments"]}]

Most observational results on the high redshift restframe UV-bright\ngalaxies are based on samples pinpointed using the so called dropout technique\nor Ly-alpha selection. However, the availability of multifilter data allows now\nreplacing the dropout selections by direct methods based on photometric\nredshifts. In this paper we present the methodology to select and study the\npopulation of high redshift galaxies in the ALHAMBRA survey data. Aims. Our aim\nis to develop a less biased methodology than the traditional dropout technique\nto study the high redshift galaxies in ALHAMBRA and other multifilter data.\nThanks to the wide area ALHAMBRA covers, we especially aim at contributing in\nthe study of the brightest, less frequent, high redshift galaxies. Methods. The\nmethodology is based on redshift probability distribution functions (zPDFs). It\nis shown how a clean galaxy sample can be obtained by selecting the galaxies\nwith high integrated probability of being within a given redshift interval.\nHowever, reaching both a complete and clean sample with this method is\nchallenging. Hence, a method to derive statistical properties by summing the\nzPDFs of all the galaxies in the redshift bin of interest is introduced.\nResults. Using this methodology we derive the galaxy rest frame UV number\ncounts in five redshift bins centred at z=2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.5, being\ncomplete up to the limiting magnitude at m_UV(AB)=24. With the wide field\nALHAMBRA data we especially contribute in the study of the brightest ends of\nthese counts, sampling well the surface densities down to m_UV(AB)=21-22.\nConclusions. We show that using the zPDFs it is easy to select a clean sample\nof high redshift galaxies. We also show that statistical analysis of the\nproperties of galaxies is better done using a probabilistic approach, which\ntakes into account both the incompleteness and contamination in a natural way.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 figures; Accepted for A&A; language corrected"]}]

We elucidate the transition from statistically homogeneous\nturbulence without zonal flows to statistically inhomogeneous turbulence with\nsteady zonal flows. Starting from the Hasegawa--Mima equation, we employ both\nthe quasilinear approximation and a statistical average, which retains a great\ndeal of the qualitative behavior of the full system. Within the resulting\nframework known as CE2, we extend recent understanding of the symmetry-breaking\n`zonostrophic instability'. Zonostrophic instability can be understood in a\nvery general way as the instability of some turbulent background spectrum to a\nzonally symmetric coherent mode. As a special case, the background spectrum can\nconsist of only a single mode. We find that in this case the dispersion\nrelation of zonostrophic instability from the CE2 formalism reduces exactly to\nthat of the 4-mode truncation of generalized modulational instability. We then\nshow that zonal flows constitute pattern formation amid a turbulent bath.\nZonostrophic instability is an example of a Type I$_s$ instability of\npattern-forming systems. The broken symmetry is statistical homogeneity. Near\nthe bifurcation point, the slow dynamics of CE2 are governed by a well-known\namplitude equation, the real Ginzburg-Landau equation. The important features\nof this amplitude equation, and therefore of the CE2 system, are multiple.\nFirst, the zonal flow wavelength is not unique. In an idealized, infinite\nsystem, there is a continuous band of zonal flow wavelengths that allow a\nnonlinear equilibrium.

The anchoring transition is explained by the balance of\n(a) the intrinsic perpendicular surface anchoring produced by the polyimide\naligning layer and (b) tangential alignment caused by ionic impurities forming\nelectric double layers.

Although there are many software quality models, to the\nauthors' knowledge no works survey the challenges related to software\nquality-in-use measurement. This article has two main contributions: 1) it\nidentifies and explains major issues and challenges in measuring software\nquality in use in the context of the ISO SQuaRE series and related software\nquality models and highlights open research areas; and 2) it sheds light on a\nresearch direction that can be used to predict software quality in use. In\nshort, the quality-in-use measurement issues are related to the complexity of\nthe current standard models and the limitations and incompleteness of the\ncustomized software quality models. A sentiment analysis of software reviews is\nproposed to deal with these issues.\n","Comment: 4 Figures"]}]

A\nfractional diffusion-drift equation is used to solve the bulk behavior of the\nmobile charges in the electrolyte. The complex adsorption-desorption process at\nthe electrode-electrolyte interface produces an anomalous effect in the system.\nThe model gives a very good fit for the observed impedance data for this\nbiopolymer based solid electrolyte in wide range of frequencies.
