This method, however, relies on the assumption\nthat the baryon fraction in clusters agrees with the cosmic value\nOmega_b/Omega_m, and does not differ from one system to another. We test this\nhypothesis by measuring the gas mass fraction over the entire cluster volume in\na sample of local clusters.

The gas mass fraction increases with radius and reaches\nthe cosmic baryon fraction close to R200. At R200, we measure\nfgas,200=0.176+/-0.009. We find significant differences between the baryon\nfraction of relaxed, cool-core (CC) systems and unrelaxed, non-cool core (NCC)\nclusters in the outer regions. In average, the gas fraction in NCC clusters\nslightly exceeds the cosmic baryon fraction, while in CC systems the gas\nfraction converges to the expected value when accounting for the stellar\ncontent, without any evidence for variations from one system to another. We\nfind that fgas estimates in NCC systems slightly disagree with the cosmic value\napproaching R200. This result could be explained either by a violation of the\nassumption of hydrostatic equilibrium or by an inhomogeneous distribution of\nthe gas mass.

To\ndate, however, the primary mechanism of disseminating CARS spectroscopic\ninformation is through pseudocolor imagery, which explicitly neglects a vast\nmajority of the hyperspectral data. Furthermore, current paradigms in CARS\nspectral processing do not lend themselves to quantitative sample-to-sample\ncomparability. The primary limitation stems from the need to accurately measure\nthe so-called nonresonant background (NRB) that is used to extract the\nchemically-sensitive Raman information from the raw spectra. Measurement of the\nNRB on a pixel-by-pixel basis is a nontrivial task; thus, reference NRB from\nglass or water are typically utilized, resulting in error between the actual\nand estimated amplitude and phase. In this manuscript, we present a new\nmethodology for extracting the Raman spectral features that significantly\nsuppresses these errors through phase detrending and scaling. Classic methods\nof error-correction, such as baseline detrending, are demonstrated to be\ninaccurate and to simply mask the underlying errors.

This is in\ncontrast to legacy wireless systems where data is embedded in a Radio Frequency\n(RF) source prior to the transmit antenna. MBM offers several advantages vs.\nlegacy systems, including \"additivity of information over multiple receive\nantennas\", and \"inherent diversity over a static fading channel\". MBM is\nparticularly suitable for transmitting high data rates using a single transmit\nand multiple receive antennas (Single Input-Multiple Output Media-Based\nModulation, or SIMO-MBM). However, complexity issues limit the amount of data\nthat can be embedded in the channel state using a single transmit unit.

This performance is achieved using a single transmission\nand without adding any redundancy for Forward-Error-Correction (FEC). This\nmeans, in addition to its excellent SER vs. energy/rate performance, MBM\nrelaxes the need for complex FEC structures, and thereby minimizes the\ntransmission delay. Overall, LMIMO-MBM provides a promising alternative to MIMO\nand Massive MIMO for the realization of 5G wireless networks.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 11 figures, additional examples are given to further\n  explain the idea of Media-Based Modulation.

Analog processing techniques can be\nused on receive to reduce the number of measurements to N, the number of\npotential delay bins. If the scene interrogated by the radar is assumed to be\nsparse consisting of K point targets, results from compressive sensing suggest\nthat number of measurements can be further reduced to scale with K logN for\nstable recovery of a sparse scene from measurements with additive noise. While\nunstructured random projectors guarantee successful recovery under sparsity\nconstraints, they cannot be implemented in the radar hardware in practice.\nRecently, structured random Toeplitz and Circulant matrices that result from\nusing stochastic waveforms in time delay estimation setting have been shown to\nyield recovery guarantees similar to unstructured sensing matrices.

A numerical study shows that the anti-SU(7) model\nsatisfies the CKM fit. It is shown that the doublet-triplet splitting is\nobtained naturally, where the dominant process for proton decay is by the\nexchange of GUT scale gauge bosons such that proton to pi-zero plus positron is\nthe dominant channel.\n","Comment: 19 pages, with 8 figures, talk at Planck 2015, Ioannina, Greece"]}]

The motivation for this work was to achieve a more balanced\ntreatment of the position and momentum variables (aka. holonomies and fluxes).\nIndeed, states in the AL Hilbert spaces describe discrete quantum excitations\non top of a vacuum which is an eigenstate of the flux variables (a\n`no-geometry' state): in such states, most holonomies are totally spread,\nmaking it difficult to approximate a smooth, classical 4-geometry. However,\ngoing beyond the AL sector does not fully resolve this difficulty: one uncovers\na deeper issue hindering the construction of states semi-classical with respect\nto a full set of observables. In the present article, we analyze this issue in\nthe case of real-valued holonomies (we will briefly comment on the heuristic\nimplications for other gauge groups, eg. $\\mathcal{SU}(2)$). Specifically, we\nshow that, in this case, there does not exist any state on the holonomy-flux\nalgebra in which the variances of the holonomies and fluxes observables would\nall be finite, let alone small. It is important to note that this obstruction\ncannot be bypassed by further enlarging the quantum state space, for it arises\nfrom the structure of the algebra itself: as there are too many (uncountably\nmany) non-vanishing commutators between the holonomy and flux operators, the\ncorresponding Heisenberg inequalities force the quantum uncertainties to blow\nup uncontrollably. A way out would be to suitably restrict the algebra of\nobservables. In a companion paper we take the first steps in this direction by\ndeveloping a general framework to perform such a restriction without giving up\nthe universality and diffeomorphism invariance of the theory.\n","Comment: 51 pages, 1 figure"]}]

One can thus bypass the need to select a\nvacuum state for the theory, and still be provided with an explicit and\nconstructive description of the quantum state space, at least as long as the\nlabel set indexing the projective structure is countable. Because uncountable\nlabel sets are much less practical in this context, we develop in the present\narticle a general procedure to trim an originally uncountable label set down to\ncountable cardinality. In particular, we investigate how to perform this\ntightening of the label set in a way that preserves both the physical content\nof the algebra of observables and its symmetries. This work is notably\nmotivated by applications to the holonomy-flux algebra underlying Loop Quantum\nGravity. Building on earlier work by Okolow [arXiv:1304.6330], a projective\nstate space was introduced for this algebra in [arXiv:1411.3592]. However, the\nnon-trivial structure of the holonomy-flux algebra prevents the construction of\nsatisfactory semi-classical states. Implementing the general procedure just\nmentioned in the case of a one-dimensional version of this algebra, we show how\na discrete subalgebra can be extracted without destroying universality nor\ndiffeomorphism invariance.

The construction does not give the digits of the fractional expansion\nexplicitly, but it gives a sequence of increasing approximations whose limit is\nthe announced absolutely normal number. The $n$-th approximation has an error\nless than $2^{2^{-n}}$. To obtain the $n$-th approximation the construction\nrequires, in the worst case, a number of mathematical operations that is double\nexponential in $n$. We consider variants on the construction that reduce the\ncomputational complexity at the expense of an increment in discrepancy.\n","Comment: 20 pages with references; submitted to AMS Mathematics of Computation"]}]

In\nthe context of inflationary cosmology, this implies that the CMB data are now\nsensitive to the form of the inflaton potential. Most of the current approaches\ndevoted to the derivation of the inflationary primordial power spectra, or to\nthe inflaton potential reconstruction problem, rely on approximate analytical\ntreatments that may break down for exotic models. In this article, we\nnumerically solve the inflationary evolution of both the background and all the\nperturbed quantities to extract the primordial power spectra exactly. Such a\nmethod solely relies on General Relativity and linear perturbation theory. More\nthan providing a tool to test analytical approximations, one may consider,\nwithout complications, the treatment of non-standard inflationary models as\nthose involving several fields, eventually non-minimally coupled to gravity.\n  The usefulness of the exact numerical approach to deal with CMB data is\nillustrated by analysing the WMAP third year data in the context of single\nfield models. For this purpose, we introduce a new inflationary related\nparameter encoding the basic properties of the reheating era. This reheating\nparameter has significant observable effects and provides a self-consistency\ntest of inflationary models. As a working example, the marginalised probability\ndistributions of the reheating and potential parameters associated with the\nsmall field models are presented.\n","Comment: 33 pages, 12 figures.
