In\nthis paper we show how to express this quantity as a regularised optimisation\nof the entanglement formation over states that can be generated between sender\nand receiver. Our formula is the channel analog of a well-known formula for the\nentanglement cost of quantum states in terms of the entanglement of formation;\nand shares a similar relation to the recently shattered hope for additivity.\nThe entanglement cost of a quantum channel can be seen as the analog of the\nquantum reverse Shannon theorem in the case where free classical communication\nis allowed.

This not only improves the\nrange of parameters where security can be shown, but also allows us to prove\nsecurity for storage devices for which no results were known before.

Our perspective is that such\nsimulations should be based on transforming observations to account for GCM\nprojected changes, in contrast to methods that transform GCM output to account\nfor discrepancies with observations. Our methodology is designed for simulating\ntransient (non-stationary) climates, which are evolving in response to changes\nin CO$_2$ concentrations (as is the Earth at present).

We find that, at least in CCSM3, changes in the local\ncovariance structure can be explained as a function of the regional mean change\nin temperature and the rate of change of warming. This feature means that the\nstatistical model can be used to emulate the evolving covariance structure of\nGCM temperatures under scenarios for which the GCM has not been run.

With more personalized mobile devices\nin hand, many services choose to offer alternative, usually more convenient,\napproaches to authenticating and delivering the content between mobile users\nand service providers. One main option is to use SMS (i.e., short messaging\nservice). Such carrier-grade text service has been widely used to assist\nversatile mobile services, including social networking, banking, to name a few.\nThough the text service can be spoofed via certain Internet text service\nproviders which cooperated with carriers, such attacks haven well studied and\ndefended by industry due to the efforts of research community. However, as\ncellular network technology advances to the latest IP-based 4G LTE, we find\nthat these mobile services are somehow exposed to new threats raised by this\nchange, particularly on 4G LTE Text service (via brand-new distributed\nMobile-Initiated Spoofed SMS attack which is not available in legacy 2G/3G\nsystems). The reason is that messaging service over LTE shifts from the\ncircuit-switched (CS) design to the packet-switched (PS) paradigm as 4G LTE\nsupports PS only. Due to this change, 4G LTE Text Service becomes open to\naccess. However, its shields to messaging integrity and user authentication are\nnot in place. As a consequence, such weaknesses can be exploited to launch\nattacks (e.g., hijack Facebook accounts) against a targeted individual, a large\nscale of mobile users and even service providers, from mobile devices. Current\ndefenses for Internet-Initiated Spoofed SMS attacks cannot defend the\nunprecedented attack. Our study shows that 53 of 64 mobile services over 27\nindustries are vulnerable to at least one threat.

After gas dispersal, orbits of these trapped planets\nare altered through interaction with a residual planetesimal disk. They found\nthat for massive enough disks planet-planetesimal disk interactions can break\nresonances and naturally create moderate to large positive offsets from the\ninitial period ratio for large ranges of planetesimal disk and planet\nproperties. Divergence from resonance only happens if the mass of planetesimals\nthat interact with the planets is at least a few percent of the total planet\nmass. This threshold, above which resonances are broken and the offset from\nresonances can grow, naturally explains why the asymmetric large offsets were\nnot seen in more massive planet pairs found via past radial velocity surveys.\nIn this article we will highlight some of the key findings of CF15. In\naddition, we report preliminary results from an extension of this study, that\ninvestigates the effects of planet-planetesimal disk interactions on initially\nnon-resonant planet pairs.

Incentive equilibria generalise well-studied solution concepts such as\nNash equilibria and leader equilibria (also known as Stackelberg equilibria).\nRecall that a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can improve\nhis payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally. In the setting of incentive\nand leader equilibria, there is a distinguished player called the leader who\ncan assign strategies to all other players, referred to as her followers. A\nstrategy profile is a leader strategy profile if no player, except for the\nleader, can improve his payoff by changing his strategy unilaterally, and a\nleader equilibrium is a leader strategy profile with a maximal return for the\nleader. In the proposed case of incentive equilibria, the leader can\nadditionally influence the behaviour of her followers by transferring parts of\nher payoff to her followers. The ability to incentivise her followers provides\nthe leader with more freedom in selecting strategy profiles, and we show that\nthis can indeed improve the payoff for the leader in such games. The key\nfundamental result of the paper is the existence of incentive equilibria in\nmean-payoff games. We further show that the decision problem related to\nconstructing incentive equilibria is NP-complete. On a positive note, we show\nthat, when the number of players is fixed, the complexity of the problem falls\nin the same class as two-player mean-payoff games.

However, there are still a\nfew concerns: new Planck data impose constraints on the shape of the inflaton\npotential, which exclude a lot of inflationary models; dark matter is not\ndetected directly, and dark energy is not understood theoretically on a\nsatisfactory level. In this brief sketch we investigate an alternative\ncosmological model with spherical spatial geometry and an additional perfect\nfluid with the constant parameter $\\omega=-1/3$ in the linear equation of\nstate. It is demonstrated explicitly that in the framework of such a model it\nis possible to satisfy the supernovae data at the same level of accuracy as\nwithin the $\\Lambda$CDM model and at the same time suppose that the observed\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation originates from a very limited\nspace region. This is ensured by introducing an additional condition of light\npropagation between the antipodal points during the age of the Universe.\nConsequently, the CMB uniformity can be explained without the inflation\nscenario.

Without fitting a\nfull information model, the method is computationally fast and allows for\nparallel implementation.

Imagine an infinite list of \"boxes\", with a \"treasure\"\nhidden in one of them, where the boxes' order reflects the importance of\nfinding the treasure in a given box. At each time step, a search protocol\nexecuted by a searcher has the ability to peek into one box, and see whether\nthe treasure is present or not. By equally dividing the workload between them,\n$k$ searchers can find the treasure $k$ times faster than one searcher.\nHowever, this straightforward strategy is very sensitive to failures (e.g.,\ncrashes of processors), and overcoming this issue seems to require a large\namount of communication. We therefore address the question of designing\nparallel search algorithms maximizing their speed-up and maintaining high\nlevels of robustness, while minimizing the amount of resources for\ncoordination. Based on the observation that algorithms that avoid communication\nare inherently robust, we analyze the best running time performance of\nnon-coordinating algorithms. Specifically, we devise non-coordinating\nalgorithms that achieve a speed-up of $9/8$ for two searchers, a speed-up of\n$4/3$ for three searchers, and in general, a speed-up of $\\frac{k}{4}(1+1/k)^2$\nfor any $k\\geq 1$ searchers. Thus, asymptotically, the speed-up is only four\ntimes worse compared to the case of full-coordination, and our algorithms are\nsurprisingly simple and hence applicable. Moreover, these bounds are tight in a\nstrong sense as no non-coordinating search algorithm can achieve better\nspeed-ups. Overall, we highlight that, in faulty contexts in which coordination\nbetween the searchers is technically difficult to implement, intrusive with\nrespect to privacy, and/or costly in term of resources, it might well be worth\ngiving up on coordination, and simply run our non-coordinating exhaustive\nsearch algorithms.\n"]}]

In Graham & Fruchter (2013), we showed that LGRBs\nexhibit a strong and apparently intrinsic preference for low metallicity\nenvironments (12+log(O/H) < 8.4 in the KK04 scale) in spite of these three\ncases with abundances of about solar and above. These exceptions however are\nconsistent with the general star-forming galaxy population of comparable\nbrightness & redshift. This is surprising: even among a preselected sample of\nhigh metallicity LGRBs, were the metal aversion to remain in effect for these\nobjects, we would expect their metallicity to still be lower than the typical\nmetallicity for the galaxies at that luminosity and redshift. Therefore we\ndeduce that it is possible to form an LGRB in a high metallicity environment\nalthough with greater rarity.\n  From this we conclude that there are three possible explanations for the\npresence of the LGRBs observed in high metallicity hosts as seen to date: (1)\nLGRBs do not occur in high metallicity environments and those seen in high\nmetallicity hosts are in fact occurring in low metallicity environments that\nhave become associated with otherwise high metallicity hosts but remain\nunenriched. (2) The LGRB formation mechanism while preferring low metallicity\nenvironments does not strictly require it resulting in a gradual decline in\nburst formation with increasing metallicity. (3) The typical low metallicity\nLGRBs and the few high metallicity cases are the result of physically different\nburst formation pathways with only the former affected by the metallicity and\nthe later occurring much more infrequently.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 10 figures"]}]
