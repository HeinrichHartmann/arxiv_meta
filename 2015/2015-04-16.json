As such, the resulting reduced-order model retains key properties\nsuch as energy conservation and symplectic time-evolution maps. We focus on\nparameterized simple mechanical systems subjected to Rayleigh damping and\nexternal forces, and consider an application to nonlinear structural dynamics.\nTo preserve structure, the method first approximates the system's `Lagrangian\ningredients'---the Riemannian metric, the potential-energy function, the\ndissipation function, and the external force---and subsequently derives\nreduced-order equations of motion by applying the (forced) Euler--Lagrange\nequation with these quantities. From the algebraic perspective, key\ncontributions include two efficient techniques for approximating parameterized\nreduced matrices while preserving symmetry and positive definiteness: matrix\ngappy POD and reduced-basis sparsification (RBS). Results for a parameterized\ntruss-structure problem demonstrate the importance of preserving Lagrangian\nstructure and illustrate the proposed method's merits: it reduces computation\ntime while maintaining high accuracy and stability, in contrast to existing\nnonlinear model-reduction techniques that do not preserve structure.\n","Comment: Submitted to SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing (SISC)"]}]

To model normed errors, the method employs existing\nrigorous error bounds and residual norms as indicators; numerical experiments\nshow that the method leads to a near-optimal expected effectivity in contrast\nto typical error bounds. To model errors in general outputs, the method uses\ndual-weighted residuals---which are amenable to uncertainty control---as\nindicators. Experiments illustrate that correcting the reduced-order-model\noutput with this surrogate can improve prediction accuracy by an order of\nmagnitude; this contrasts with existing `multifidelity correction' approaches,\nwhich often fail for reduced-order models and suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality.

These degeneracies cannot be broken by the CMB constraint on the\neffective number of neutrinos, N_eff. However, since big bang nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) is also affected by a light WIMP and equivalent neutrinos, complementary\nBBN and CMB constraints can break some of the degeneracy. In a previous paper\nBBN and CMB were combined to explore allowed ranges for m_chi, Delta N_nu, and\nN_eff for light WIMPs that annihilate electromagnetically (EM) to photons\nand/or electrons/positrons. In this paper BBN predictions with a light WIMP\nthat only couples to neutrinos are calculated.

The phase transition predicted by our method\nis weakly first order and the Goldstone theorem is satisfied. We also show\nthat, in contrast to PT, the symmetry improved 3PIEA at 2 loops does not\npredict the correct Higgs decay rate, but does at 3 loops. These results\nsuggest that symmetry improvement should not be applied to $n$PIEA truncated to\n$<n$ loops. We also show that symmetry improvement is compatible with the\nColeman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, a check on the consistency of the formalism.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 15 figures, 2 supplemental Mathematica notebooks.

Thanks to work of Hooley, we know that this\nconjecture is true, conditional on the truth of the Generalized Riemann\nHypothesis. Using a combination of Hooley's analysis and the techniques of\nMaynard-Tao used to prove the existence of bounded gaps between primes, Pollack\nhas shown that (conditional on GRH) there are bounded gaps between primes with\na prescribed primitive root. In the present article, we provide an\nunconditional proof of the analogue of Pollack's work in the function field\ncase; namely, that given a monic polynomial $g(t)$ which is not an $v$th power\nfor any prime $v$ dividing $q-1$, there are bounded gaps between monic\nirreducible polynomials $P(t)$ in $\\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ for which $g(t)$ is a\nprimitive root (which is to say that $g(t)$ generates the group of units modulo\n$P(t)$). In particular, we obtain bounded gaps between primitive polynomials,\ncorresponding to the choice $g(t) = t$.\n"]}]

The hybrid processing is performed through\nlow-dimensional digital baseband processing combined with analog RF processing\nenabled by phase shifters.

The constant amplitude constraint of\nanalog RF processing results in the matrix decomposition problem non-convex.\nBased on an alternate optimization technique, the non-convex matrix\ndecomposition problem can be decoupled into a series of convex sub-problems and\neffectively solved by restricting the phase increment of each entry in the RF\nprecoder/combiner within a small vicinity of its preceding iterate. A singular\nvalue decomposition based technique is proposed to secure an initial point\nsufficiently close to the global solution of the original non-convex problem.\nThrough simulation, the convergence of the alternate optimization for such a\nmatrix decomposition based hybrid processing (MD-HP) scheme is examined, and\nthe performance of the MD-HP scheme is demonstrated to be near-optimal.\n"]}]

The key of our idea is that the pairing symmetry of a\nFermi superfluid is fully dominated by the symmetry of the superfluid order\nparameter, which is essentially given by the product of a pair amplitude and a\npairing interaction. Noting this, in our proposal, we first prepare a $p$-wave\npair amplitude by, not using a $p$-wave interaction, but using the phenomenon\nthat a $p$-wave pair amplitude is induced in an $s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas\nwith antisymmetric spin-orbit interaction. In this case, although the system is\nstill in the $s$-wave superfluid state with the $s$-wave superfluid order\nparameter, when one suddenly replaces the $s$-wave interaction by an\nappropriate $p$-wave one (which is possible in cold Fermi gases by using a\nFeshbach resonance technique), the product of the $p$-wave interaction and the\n$p$-wave pair amplitude that has already been prepared in the spin-orbit\ncoupled $s$-wave superfluid state immediately gives a finite $p$-wave\nsuperfluid order parameter. Thus, at least just after this manipulation, the\nsystem is in the $p$-wave superfluid state, being characterized by the\nartificially produced $p$-wave superfluid parameter. In this paper, to assess\nour idea, we evaluate the $p$-wave pair amplitude in a spin-orbit coupled\n$s$-wave superfluid Fermi gas at $T=0$. We determine the region where a large\n$p$-wave pair amplitude is obtained in the phase diagram with respect to the\nstrengths of the $s$-wave pairing interaction and the spin-orbit coupling. We\nalso discuss the accessibility of this optimal region on the viewpoint of the\nsuperfluid phase transition temperature.

However, providing backhaul connectivity for all macro and pico\nbase stations (BSs) in HetNets constitutes a significant share of\ninfrastructure cost. Recently, the idea of flexible backhaul has drown a lot of\nattention both from industry and academia. Under this architecture, not all the\npico BSs are connected to the backhaul, resulting in a significant reduction in\nthe infrastructure costs. In this regard, pico BSs without backhaul\nconnectivity need to communicate with their nearby BSs in order to have\nindirect accessibility to the backhaul. This makes the radio resource\nmanagement (RRM) in such networks more complex and challenging. In this paper,\nwe address the problem of cross-layer RRM in HetNets with flexible backhaul. We\nformulate the RRM problem as a two timescale non-convex stochastic optimization\nproblem which jointly optimizes flow control, routing control, interference\nmitigation and link scheduling in order to maximize a generic network utility.\nBy exploiting the hidden convexity of this non-convex problem, we propose an\niterative algorithm which is converges to the global optimal solution.
