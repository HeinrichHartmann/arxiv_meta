In case of a tie, the agent does not change her\ncurrent preference. A profile of the agents' preferences is stable if the\npreference of each agent coincides with the preference of at least half of the\nneighbors (thus, the system is in equilibrium).\n  We ask whether there are network topologies that are robust to social\npressure.

We completely\ncharacterize the graphs with this robustness property by showing that this is\npossible only if the graph has no edge or is a clique or very close to a\nclique. In other words, except for this handful of graphs, every graph admits\nat least one initial profile of preferences in which the majority dynamics can\nsubvert the initial majority.

The joint\noptimization of the deep recurrent neural networks with an extra masking layer\nenforces a reconstruction constraint. Moreover, we explore a discriminative\ncriterion for training neural networks to further enhance the separation\nperformance. We evaluate the proposed system on the TSP, MIR-1K, and TIMIT\ndatasets for speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising\ntasks, respectively. Our approaches achieve 2.30--4.98 dB SDR gain compared to\nNMF models in the speech separation task, 2.30--2.48 dB GNSDR gain and\n4.32--5.42 dB GSIR gain compared to existing models in the singing voice\nseparation task, and outperform NMF and DNN baselines in the speech denoising\ntask.\n"]}]

Sequential posted price\nmechanisms are conceptually simple mechanisms that work by proposing a\ntake-it-or-leave-it offer to each buyer. We apply sequential posted price\nmechanisms to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands\nonly one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the\nbuyers.

We extend this result to the the case of a continuous\nvaluation distribution when various standard assumptions hold simultaneously.\nIn fact, it turns out that the best fraction of the optimal revenue that is\nextractable by a sequential posted price mechanism is proportional to ratio of\nthe highest and lowest possible valuation. We prove that for two simple\ngeneralizations of these mechanisms, a better revenue performance can be\nachieved: if the sequential posted price mechanism has for each buyer the\noption of either proposing an offer or asking the buyer for its valuation, then\na Omega(1/max{1,d}) fraction of the optimal revenue can be extracted, where d\ndenotes the degree of dependence of the valuations, ranging from complete\nindependence (d=0) to arbitrary dependence (d=n-1).

We present measurement and classification results numerically\nand visually that: provide details on IPv6 address use and structure in global\noperation across the past year; establish the efficacy of our classification\nmethods; and demonstrate that such classification can clarify dimensions of the\nInternet that otherwise appear quite blurred by current IPv6 addressing\npractices.\n"]}]

Here, to reveal the\norigins of this ill-conditioning, we start with a general treatment of the\npoint charge fitting problem as an inverse problem, and construct an\nanalytically soluble model with the point charges spherically arranged\naccording to Lebedev quadrature naturally suited for the inverse electrostatic\nproblem. This analytical model is contrasted to the atom-centered point-charge\nmodel that can be viewed as an irregular quadrature poorly suited for the\nproblem. This analysis shows that the numerical problems of the point charge\nfitting are due to the decay of the curvatures corresponding to the\neigenvectors of LS sum Hessian matrix. In part, this ill-conditioning is\nintrinsic to the problem and related to decreasing electrostatic contribution\nof the higher multipole moments, that are, in the case of Lebedev grid model,\ndirectly associated with the Hessian eigenvectors. For the atom-centered model,\nthis association breaks down beyond the first few eigenvectors related to the\nhigh-curvature monopole and dipole terms; this leads to even wider spread-out\nof the Hessian curvature values. Using these insights, it is possible to\nalleviate the ill-conditioning of the LS point-charge fitting without\nintroducing external restraints and/or constraints.

However, the two core, non-functional\nrequirements were negated from the project due to lack of experience and strict\ntime constraints. This project aimed to investigate whether the application\nwould be more suited to a non-relational solution.\n  Method: The application was re-written using the MEAN stack (MongoDB,\nExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS), an open source, fully JavaScript stack and then\nperformance tests were carried out to compare the two applications. A\nscalability review was also conducted to assess the benefits and drawbacks of\neach technology in this aspect.\n  Results: The investigation proved that the non-relational solution was much\nmore efficient and performed faster.

We use an iteration method generated by an\nelliptic operator, associated with a certain simplified (e.g., homogenized)\nproblem. On each step of this procedure it is required to solve an auxiliary\nelliptic boundary value problem with non--oscillating coefficients $A_0$. All\nthe information related to complicated coefficients of the original\ndifferential problem is encompasses in the linear functional, which forms the\nright hand side of the auxiliary problem. Therefore, explicit inversion of the\noriginal operator associated with oscillating coefficients is avoided. The only\noperation used instead is multiplication of the operator by a vector (vector\nfunction), which can be efficiently performed due to the low-rank QTT tensor\noperations with the rank parameter controlled by the given precision $\\delta\n>0$ independent on the parameter $\\epsilon$.

Under\ntruthful bidding, the SMRA is known to output a Walrasian equilibrium that\nmaximizes social welfare provided the bidder valuation functions satisfy the\ngross substitutes property. Recently, it was shown that the combinatorial clock\nauction (CCA) provides good welfare guarantees for general classes of valuation\nfunctions. This motivates the question of whether similar welfare guarantees\nhold for the SMRA in the case of general valuation functions.\n  We show the answer is no. But we prove that good welfare guarantees still\narise if the degree of complementarities in the bidder valuations are bounded.\nIn particular, if bidder valuations functions are $\\alpha$-near-submodular\nthen, under truthful bidding, the SMRA has a welfare ratio (the worst case\nratio between the social welfare of the optimal allocation and the auction\nallocation) of at most $(1+\\alpha)$. The special case of submodular valuations,\nnamely $\\alpha=1$, and produces individually rational solutions. However, for\n$\\alpha>1$, this is a bicriteria guarantee, to obtain good welfare under\ntruthful bidding requires relaxing individual rationality.\n  Finally, we examine what strategies are required to ensure individual\nrationality in the SMRA with general valuation functions. First, we provide a\nweak characterization, namely \\emph{secure bidding}, for individual\nrationality. We then show that if the bidders use a profit-maximizing secure\nbidding strategy the welfare ratio is at most $1+\\alpha$. Consequently, by\nbidding securely, it is possible to obtain the same welfare guarantees as\ntruthful bidding without the loss of individual rationality.\n"]}]

Most studies on\ndynamic failure focus on the behaviour of bulk systems in one, two and three\ndimensions under impact and explosive loading, showing universal power law\nbehaviour of fragment size distribution. However, hardly any studies have been\ndevoted to fragmentation of shells. We present a detailed experimental and\ntheoretical study on the fragmentation of closed thin shells of various\nmaterials, due to an excess load inside the system and impact with a hard wall.\nCharacteristic fragmentation mechanisms are identified by means of a high speed\ncamera and fragment shapes and mass distributions are evaluated. Theoretical\nrationalisation is given by means of stochastic break-up models and large-scale\ndiscrete element simulations with spherical shell systems under different\nextreme loading situations. By this we ex-plain fragment shapes and\ndistributions and prove a power law for the fragment mass distribution.\nSatisfactory agreement between experimental findings and nu-merical predictions\nof the exponents of the power laws for the fragment shapes is obtained.\n"]}]

Our main focus is on optimizing\nthe memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by\nthe limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three\nmain techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing\nclassical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first,\nwherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to\nmodify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is\nintroduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing\nto clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to \"garbage collection\" for\nreversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to\ntransform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space\nconstraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed.\n  We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a\nsubset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which\ncan then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific\nlanguage for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a\nnumber of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including\nreversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions,\nreversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational\ncircuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method,\nREVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an\nonly moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to\ncompile the reversible networks.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables"]}]
