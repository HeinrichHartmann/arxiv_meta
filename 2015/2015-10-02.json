This imitating behavior might lead to the\nstrategic decision of adopting a public behavior that differs from what the\nagent believes is the right one and this can subvert the behavior of the\npopulation as a whole.\n  In this paper, we consider the case in which agents express preferences over\ntwo alternatives and model social pressure with the majority dynamics: at each\nstep an agent is selected and its preference is replaced by the majority of the\npreferences of her neighbors. In case of a tie, the agent does not change her\ncurrent preference. A profile of the agents' preferences is stable if the\npreference of each agent coincides with the preference of at least half of the\nneighbors (thus, the system is in equilibrium).\n  We ask whether there are network topologies that are robust to social\npressure.

We completely\ncharacterize the graphs with this robustness property by showing that this is\npossible only if the graph has no edge or is a clique or very close to a\nclique. In other words, except for this handful of graphs, every graph admits\nat least one initial profile of preferences in which the majority dynamics can\nsubvert the initial majority.

We apply sequential posted price\nmechanisms to single-parameter multi-unit settings in which each buyer demands\nonly one item and the mechanism can assign the service to at most k of the\nbuyers.

In early\n2015, one large Content Distribution Network handles 50 billion IPv6 requests\nper day from hundreds of millions of IPv6 client addresses; billions of unique\nclient addresses are observed per month. Address counts, however, obscure the\nnumber of hosts with IPv6 connectivity to the global Internet. There are\nnumerous address assignment and subnetting options in use; privacy addresses\nand dynamic subnet pools significantly inflate the number of active IPv6\naddresses. As the IPv6 address space is vast, it is infeasible to\ncomprehensively probe every possible unicast IPv6 address. Thus, to survey the\ncharacteristics of IPv6 addressing, we perform a year-long passive measurement\nstudy, analyzing the IPv6 addresses gleaned from activity logs for all clients\naccessing a global CDN.\n  The goal of our work is to develop flexible classification and measurement\nmethods for IPv6, motivated by the fact that its addresses are not merely more\nnumerous; they are different in kind. We introduce the notion of classifying\naddresses and prefixes in two ways: (1) temporally, according to their\ninstances of activity to discern which addresses can be considered stable; (2)\nspatially, according to the density or sparsity of aggregates in which active\naddresses reside. We present measurement and classification results numerically\nand visually that: provide details on IPv6 address use and structure in global\noperation across the past year; establish the efficacy of our classification\nmethods; and demonstrate that such classification can clarify dimensions of the\nInternet that otherwise appear quite blurred by current IPv6 addressing\npractices.\n"]}]

This analytical model is contrasted to the atom-centered point-charge\nmodel that can be viewed as an irregular quadrature poorly suited for the\nproblem. This analysis shows that the numerical problems of the point charge\nfitting are due to the decay of the curvatures corresponding to the\neigenvectors of LS sum Hessian matrix. In part, this ill-conditioning is\nintrinsic to the problem and related to decreasing electrostatic contribution\nof the higher multipole moments, that are, in the case of Lebedev grid model,\ndirectly associated with the Hessian eigenvectors. For the atom-centered model,\nthis association breaks down beyond the first few eigenvectors related to the\nhigh-curvature monopole and dipole terms; this leads to even wider spread-out\nof the Hessian curvature values. Using these insights, it is possible to\nalleviate the ill-conditioning of the LS point-charge fitting without\nintroducing external restraints and/or constraints.

Over time, dynamical evolution through two-body relaxation will\ncause the most massive objects to migrate to the cluster center, while the\nrelatively lower-mass objects remain in or migrate to orbits at greater radii.\nThis process will globally dominate a cluster's stellar distribution. However,\nclose encounters involving binary systems may disrupt `soft' binaries. This\nprocess will occur more frequently in a cluster's central, dense region than in\nits periphery, which may mask the effects of mass segregation. Using high\nresolution Hubble Space Telescope observations, combined with sophisticated\n$N$-body simulations, we investigate the radial distributions of the\nmain-sequence binary fractions in massive young Large Magellanic Cloud star\nclusters. We show that binary disruption may play an important role on very\nshort timescales, depending on the environmental conditions in the cluster\ncores. This may lead to radial binary fractions that initially decline in the\ncluster centers, which is contrary to the effects expected from dynamical mass\nsegregation.\n","Comment: To appear in Proc.

We use an iteration method generated by an\nelliptic operator, associated with a certain simplified (e.g., homogenized)\nproblem. On each step of this procedure it is required to solve an auxiliary\nelliptic boundary value problem with non--oscillating coefficients $A_0$. All\nthe information related to complicated coefficients of the original\ndifferential problem is encompasses in the linear functional, which forms the\nright hand side of the auxiliary problem. Therefore, explicit inversion of the\noriginal operator associated with oscillating coefficients is avoided. The only\noperation used instead is multiplication of the operator by a vector (vector\nfunction), which can be efficiently performed due to the low-rank QTT tensor\noperations with the rank parameter controlled by the given precision $\\delta\n>0$ independent on the parameter $\\epsilon$.

Most studies on\ndynamic failure focus on the behaviour of bulk systems in one, two and three\ndimensions under impact and explosive loading, showing universal power law\nbehaviour of fragment size distribution. However, hardly any studies have been\ndevoted to fragmentation of shells. We present a detailed experimental and\ntheoretical study on the fragmentation of closed thin shells of various\nmaterials, due to an excess load inside the system and impact with a hard wall.\nCharacteristic fragmentation mechanisms are identified by means of a high speed\ncamera and fragment shapes and mass distributions are evaluated. Theoretical\nrationalisation is given by means of stochastic break-up models and large-scale\ndiscrete element simulations with spherical shell systems under different\nextreme loading situations. By this we ex-plain fragment shapes and\ndistributions and prove a power law for the fragment mass distribution.\nSatisfactory agreement between experimental findings and nu-merical predictions\nof the exponents of the power laws for the fragment shapes is obtained.\n"]}]

Our main focus is on optimizing\nthe memory footprint of the resulting reversible networks. This is motivated by\nthe limited availability of qubits for the foreseeable future. We apply three\nmain techniques to keep the number of required qubits small when computing\nclassical, irreversible computations by means of reversible networks: first,\nwherever possible we allow the compiler to make use of in-place functions to\nmodify some of the variables. Second, an intermediate representation is\nintroduced that allows to trace data dependencies within the program, allowing\nto clean up qubits early. This realizes an analog to \"garbage collection\" for\nreversible circuits. Third, we use the concept of so-called pebble games to\ntransform irreversible programs into reversible programs under space\nconstraints, allowing for data to be erased and recomputed if needed.\n  We introduce REVS, a compiler for reversible circuits that can translate a\nsubset of the functional programming language F# into Toffoli networks which\ncan then be further interpreted for instance in LIQui|>, a domain-specific\nlanguage for quantum computing and which is also embedded into F#. We discuss a\nnumber of test cases that illustrate the advantages of our approach including\nreversible implementations of SHA-2 and other cryptographic hash-functions,\nreversible integer arithmetic, as well as a test-bench of combinational\ncircuits used in classical circuit synthesis. Compared to Bennett's method,\nREVS can reduce space complexity by a factor of $4$ or more, while having an\nonly moderate increase in circuit size as well as in the time it takes to\ncompile the reversible networks.\n","Comment: 32 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables"]}]
