This equation is a simple model for the\ncirculation of currents in closed basins. A crude analysis shows that as $\\nu\n\\to 0$, the weak limit of $\\psi$ satisfies the so-called Sverdrup transport\nequation inside the domain, namely $\\d\\_x \\psi^0=\\tau$, while boundary layers\nappear in the vicinity of the boundary. These boundary layers, which are the\nmain center of interest of the present paper, exhibit several types of peculiar\nbehaviour. First, the size of the boundary layer on the western and eastern\nboundary, which had already been computed by several authors, becomes formally\nvery large as one approaches northern and southern portions of the boundary,\ni.e. pieces of the boundary on which the normal is vertical. This phenomenon is\nknown as geostrophic degeneracy. In order to avoid such singular behaviour,\nprevious studies imposed restrictive assumptions on the domain $\\Omega$ and on\nthe forcing term $\\tau$. Here, we prove that a superposition of two boundary\nlayers occurs in the vicinity of such points: the classical western or eastern\nboundary layers, and some northern or southern boundary layers, whose\nderivation is completely new. The size of northern/southern boundary layers is\nmuch larger than the one of western boundary layers ($\\nu^{1/4}$ vs.\n$\\nu^{1/3}$). We explain in detail how the superposition takes place, depending\non the geometry of the boundary. Moreover, when the domain $\\Omega$ is not\nconnected in the $x$ direction, $\\psi^0$ is not continuous in $\\Omega$, and\nsingular layers appear in order to correct its discontinuities. These singular\nlayer are concentrated in the vicinity of horizontal lines, and therefore\npenetrate the interior of the domain $\\Omega$. Hence we exhibit some kind of\nboundary layer separation. However, we emphasize that we remain able to prove a\nconvergence theorem, so that the boundary layers somehow remain stable, in\nspite of the separation. Eventually, the effect of boundary layers is non-local\nin several aspects. On the first hand, for algebraic reasons, the boundary\nlayer equation is radically different on the west and east parts of the\nboundary. As a consequence, the Sverdrup equation is endowed with a Dirichlet\ncondition on the East boundary, and no condition on the West boundary.\nTherefore western and eastern boundary layers have in fact an influence on the\nwhole domain $\\Omega$, and not only near the boundary. On the second hand, the\nnorthern and southern boundary layer profiles obey a propagation equation,\nwhere the space variable $x$ plays the role of time, and are therefore not\nlocal.\n"]}]

We introduce a simple Encoding Rule that selectively turns \"on\"\nsynapses between neurons that co-appear in one or more patterns.

How\ndoes the brain do this? To address this question, it is important to determine\nwhat stimulus space features can - in principle - be extracted from neural\ncodes. This motivates us to define the neural ring and a related neural ideal,\nalgebraic objects that encode the full combinatorial data of a neural code. Our\nmain finding is that these objects can be expressed in a \"canonical form\" that\ndirectly translates to a minimal description of the receptive field structure\nintrinsic to the code.

The choice of model has an impact on the\nreliability of the aggregated trust information as well as on the procedure\nused to compute reputations. Two prominent models are flow-based reputation\n(e.g., EigenTrust, PageRank) and Subjective Logic based reputation.

We vary the disk mass, halo concentration,\ninitial disk thickness and inclination of the satellite orbit. The disky dwarf\ngalaxies are heated and disrupted due to the minor merger event, more extremely\nfor higher satellite over disk mass ratios, and the morphology and kinematics\nare significantly altered. Moreover, for less concentrated haloes the minor\nmerger can completely destroy the disk leaving a low-luminosity spheroidal-like\ngalaxy instead. We conclude that dwarf galaxies are very much susceptible to\nbeing disturbed by dark galaxies and that even a minor merger event can\nsignificantly disrupt and alter the structure and kinematics of a dwarf galaxy.\nThis process may be seen as a new channel for the formation of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 13 figures, A&A accepted.

We present the first\nsystematic study of the incidence of binarity for a sample of BSGs across the\ntheoretical terminal age main sequence (TAMS). To account for the distribution\nof effective temperatures of the BSGs it may be necessary to extend the TAMS to\nlower temperatures. This is consistent with the derived distribution of mass\ndiscrepancies, projected rotational velocities (vsini) and N abundances,\nprovided that stars cooler than this temperature are post RSG objects. For the\nBSGs in the Tarantula and previous FLAMES surveys, most have small vsini. About\n10% have larger vsini (>100 km/s) but surprisingly these show little or no N\nenhancement. All the cooler BSGs have low vsini of <70km/s and high N abundance\nestimates, implying that either bi-stability braking or evolution on a blue\nloop may be important. A lack of cool binaries, possibly reflects the small\nsample size. Single star evolutionary models, which include rotation, can\naccount for the N enhancement in both the single and binary samples. The\ndetailed distribution of N abundances in the single and binary samples may be\ndifferent, possibly reflecting differences in their evolutionary history. The\nfirst comparative study of single and binary BSGs has revealed that the main\nsequence may be significantly wider than previously assumed, extending to\nTeff=20000K.

There is little systematic knowledge of the contribution\nof collective excitations to the interaction between nuclei, particularly in\nthe overlap region of heavy nuclei.\n  Purpose: To study the dynamic polarization potential (DPP) generated by\nchannel coupling that had been validated for a case where scattering is\nsensitive to the nuclear potential over a wide radial range; to exhibit\nevidence of the non-locality due to collective coupling; to validate, or\notherwise, the representation of DPPs by uniform renormalization of potentials.\n  Methods: S-matrix to potential inversion yields local potentials reproducing\nthe elastic channel S-matrix of coupled channel calculations. Subtracting the\nelastic channel uncoupled potential yields a local L-independent representation\nof the DPP. The dependence of the DPP on the nature of the coupled states and\nother parameters can be studied.\n  Results: Local DPPs were found due to the excitation of C-12 and the combined\nexcitation of O-16 and C-12. The radial forms found were very different from\nuniform renormalization of the potential. Full coupling led to a 10 percent\nincrease in the volume integral of the real potential. Evidence for the\nnon-locality of the underlying formal DPP and the effect of direct coupling\nbetween the collective states is found.\n  Conclusions: The local DPP generating the secondary rainbow is found. DPPs\nhave forms depending on the specific excitations and cannot be represented by a\nuniform renormalization of the potential. The method is useful for study of the\ncontribution of collective excitations to internuclear potentials, concerning\nwhich remarkably little is known in general.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures"]}]

Here we show,\nboth theoretically and experimentally, that a wide-band-matched thin resonant\nabsorber, invisible in reflection, can be realized if one and the same resonant\nmode of the absorbing array unit cells is utilized to create both electric and\nmagnetic responses. We test this concept using chiral particles in each unit\ncells, arranged in a periodic planar racemic array, utilizing chirality\ncoupling in each unit cell but compensating the field coupling at the\nmacroscopic level. We prove that the concept and the proposed realization\napproach also can be used to create non-reflecting layers for full control of\ntransmitted fields. Our results can have a broad range of potential\napplications over the entire electromagnetic spectrum including, for example,\nperfect ultra-compact wave filters and selective multi-frequency sensors.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures"]}]

The interface is modeled as a\nlayer separating two isotropic turbulent regions with different kinetic energy\nand vapor concentration. In particular, we focus on the small scale part of the\ninertial range as well as on the dissipative range of scales which are\nimportant to the micro-physics of warm clouds. We have numerically investigated\nstably stratified interfaces by locally perturbing at an initial instant the\nstandard temperature lapse rate at the cloud interface and then observing the\ntemporal evolution of the system. When the buoyancy term becomes of the same\norder of the inertial one, we observe a spatial redistribution of the kinetic\nenergy which produce a concomitant pit of kinetic energy within the mixing\nlayer. In this situation, the mixing layer contains two interfacial regions\nwith opposite kinetic energy gradient, which in turn produces two intermittent\nsublayers in the velocity fluctuations field. This changes the structure of the\nfield with respect to the corresponding non-stratified shearless mixing: the\ncommunication between the two turbulent region is weak, and the growth of the\nmixing layer stops.

In the first approach,\nthe wavefunction of a BEC is encoded in the $N$-particle sector of an extended\n\"catalytic state\". Going to a time-dependent interaction picture, we can\norganize the effective Hamiltonian by powers of ${N}^{-1/2}$. Requiring the\nterms of order ${N}^{1/2}$ to vanish, we get the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation.\nGoing to the next order, $N^0$, we obtain the number-conserving Bogoliubov\napproximation. Our approach allows one to stay in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger picture\nand to apply many techniques from quantum optics. Moreover, it is easier to\ntrack different orders in the Hamiltonian and to generalize to the\nmulti-component case. In the second approach, I consider a state of $N =l\\times\nn$ bosons that is derived by symmetrizing the $n$-fold tensor product of an\narbitrary $l$-boson state. Particularly, we are interested in the pure state\ncase for $l=2$, which we call the Pair-Correlated State (PCS). I show that PCS\nreproduces the number-conserving Bogoliubov approximation; moreover, it also\nworks in the strong interaction regime where the Bogoliubov approximation\nfails. For the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, I find numerically that the error\n(measured by the trace distance of the two-particle reduced density matrices)\nof PCS is less than two percent over the entire parameter space, thus making\nPCS a bridge between the superfluid and Mott insulating phases. Amazingly, the\nerror of PCS does not increase, in the time-dependent case, as the system\nevolves for longer times. I derive both time-dependent and -independent\nequations for the ground state and the time evolution of the PCS ansatz. The\ntime complexity of simulating PCS does not depend on $N$ and is linear in the\nnumber of orbitals in use.\n","Comment: PhD thesis, University of New Mexico.\n  http://hdl.handle.net/1928/24564"]}]
