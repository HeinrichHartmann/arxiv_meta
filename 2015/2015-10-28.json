It is however well known that the dynamics of the\nmagnetic field is linked to that of the velocity field in the core and any\nattempt to model secular variations will involve a coupled dynamical system for\nmagnetic field and core velocity. Unfortunately, there is no direct observation\nof the velocity. Independently of the exact nature of the above-mentioned\ncoupled system -- some version being currently under construction -- the\nquestion is debated in this paper whether good knowledge of the magnetic field\ncan be translated into good knowledge of core dynamics. Furthermore, what will\nbe the impact of the most recent and precise geomagnetic data on our knowledge\nof the geomagnetic field of the past and future? These questions are cast into\nthe language of variational data assimilation, while the dynamical system\nconsidered in this paper consists in a set of two oversimplified\none-dimensional equations for magnetic and velocity fields. This toy model\nretains important features inherited from the induction and Navier-Stokes\nequations: non-linear magnetic and momentum terms are present and its linear\nresponse to small disturbances contains Alfv\\'en waves. It is concluded that\nvariational data assimilation is indeed appropriate in principle, even though\nthe velocity field remains hidden at all times; it allows us to recover the\nentire evolution of both fields from partial and irregularly distributed\ninformation on the magnetic field.

Instead, certain `anomalous' SETs can only occur on the\nsurface of a 3D symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase. In this paper we\ndescribe a procedure for determining whether an SET of a discrete, onsite,\nunitary symmetry group $G$ is anomalous or not. The basic idea is to gauge the\nsymmetry and expose the anomaly as an obstruction to a consistent topological\ntheory combining both the original anyons and the gauge fluxes. Utilizing a\nresult of Etingof, Nikshych, and Ostrik, we point out that a class of\nobstructions are captured by the fourth cohomology group $H^4( G, \\,U(1))$,\nwhich also precisely labels the set of 3D SPT phases, with symmetry group $G$.\nWe thus establish a general bulk-boundary correspondence between the anomalous\nSET and the 3d bulk SPT whose surface termination realizes it. We illustrate\nthis idea using the chiral spin liquid ($U(1)_2$) topological order with a\nreduced symmetry $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\subset SO(3)$, which can\nact on the semion quasiparticle in an anomalous way. We construct exactly\nsolved 3d SPT models realizing the anomalous surface terminations, and\ndemonstrate that they are non-trivial by computing three loop braiding\nstatistics. Possible extensions to anti-unitary symmetries are also discussed.\n","Comment: 18 pages + 3 pages appendices. v2: added section on identifying the\n  SPT order from nontrivial loop statistics in the 3D bulk with projective\n  semion surface state"]}]

For distributions on a continuous state space, one can\nfind diffusions with the target distribution as equilibrium measure, so that\nthe state of the diffusion after a long time provides a good sample from the\ndesired distribution. There exist many diffusions with a common equilibrium,\nand one would naturally like to choose those that make the convergence to\nequilibrium faster. One way to do this is to consider a reversible diffusion,\nand add to it an antisymmetric drift which preserves the invariant measure.

In atomic\nnuclei the momentum distribution of nucleons above the Fermi momentum ($k>k_F\n\\approx 250$ Mev/c) is also dominated by short rangecorrelated\ndifferent-fermion (neutron-proton) pairs.\n  Purpose: Compare high-momentum unlike-fermion momentum distributions in\natomic and nuclear systems.\n  Methods: We show that, for $k>k_F$ MeV/c, nuclear momentum distributions are\nproportional to that of the deuteron. We then examine the deuteron momentum\ndistributions derived from a wide variety of modern nucleon-nucleon potentials\nthat are consistent with $NN$-scattering data.\n  Results: The high momentum tail of the deuteron momentum distribution, and\nhence of the nuclear momentum distributions appears to decrease as $k^{-4}$.\nThis behavior is shown to arise from the effects of the tensor part of the\nnucleon-nucleon potential. In addition, when the dimensionless interaction\nstrength for the atomic system is chosen to be similar to that of atomic\nnuclei, the probability for finding a short range different-fermion pair in\nboth systems is the same.\n  Conclusions: Although nuclei do not satisfy all of the conditions for Tan's\ncontact, the observed similarity of the magnitude and $k^{-4}$ shape of nuclear\nand atomic momentum distributions is remarkable because these systems differ by\nabout $20$ orders of magnitude in density.

The\nlikelihood of such binary events -- the cornerstone also for the categoric (as\nopposed to probabilistic) prediction of threshold exceedences -- is established\nfrom long time series of one or more observables of the same system. The\nprediction skill is measured by a summary index of the ROC curve that relates\nthe hit- and false alarm rates.

This can be\nviewed as a confirmation of a counterintuitive (and seemingly contrafactual)\nstatement that was previously formulated for more simple autoregressive\nstochastic processes. However, we argue that for dynamical systems in general\nit may be typical only, but not universally true. We argue that when there is a\nsufficient amount of data depending on the precision of observation, the skill\nof a class of data-driven categoric predictions of threshold exceedences\napproximates the skill of the analogous model-driven prediction, assuming\nstrictly no model errors.

However, the\napplication of state-of-the-art LSEs is compromised by laborious parameter\ntuning and expensive computation. In this paper, we proposed two fast LSEs for\nman-made object extraction from high spatial resolution remote sensing images.\nThe traditional mean curvature-based regularization term is replaced by a\nGaussian kernel and it is mathematically sound to do that. Thus a larger time\nstep can be used in the numerical scheme to expedite the proposed LSEs. In\ncontrast to existing methods, the proposed LSEs are significantly faster. Most\nimportantly, they involve much fewer parameters while achieving better\nperformance. The advantages of the proposed LSEs over other state-of-the-art\napproaches have been verified by a range of experiments.\n","Comment: This paper includes 31 pages and 12 figures"]}]

A 2nd-order sensitivity analysis is\nconducted for the linear temporal stability of parallel flows U0 subject to\nsmall-amplitude spanwise-periodic modification e*U1, e<<1. Spanwise-periodic\nmodifications have a quadratic effect on stability, i.e. the 1st-order\neigenvalue variation is zero. A 2nd-order sensitivity operator is computed from\na 1D calculation, allowing one to predict how eigenvalues are affected by any\nU1, without actually solving for modified eigenvalues/eigenmodes.

Next, optimisation is performed on the\n2nd-order sensitivity operator: for each eigenmode streamwise wavenumber and\nbase flow modification spanwise wavenumber b, the most stabilising profiles U1\nare computed, together with lower bounds for the variation in leading\neigenvalue. These bounds increase like b^-2 as b goes to 0, yielding a large\nstabilising potential. However, 3D modes with wavenumbers |b0|=b and b/2 are\ndestabilised, thus larger control wavenumbers should be preferred.

The objective of\nthis paper is to study centralized and decentralized mechanisms that can enable\nand sustain non-trivial data exchanges among the agents. A centralized\nmechanism determines the data sharing policies that optimize a network-wide\nobjective function combining the fidelities and leakages at both agents. Using\ncommon-goal games and best-response analysis, the optimal policies allow for\ndistributed implementation. In contrast, in the decentralized setting, repeated\ndiscounted games are shown to naturally enable data exchange without any\ncentral control nor economic incentives. The effect of repetition is modeled by\na time-averaged payoff function at each agent which combines its fidelity and\nleakage at each interaction stage. For both approaches, it is shown that\nnon-trivial data exchange can be sustained for specific fidelity ranges even\nwhen privacy is a limiting factor.\n","Comment: submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing"]}]

Such systems allow for an\nextension of the constant shift symmetry to a shift by a polynomial of degree\n$P$ in spatial coordinates. These \"polynomial shift symmetries\" in turn protect\nthe technical naturalness of modes with a higher-order dispersion relation, and\nlead to a refinement of the proposed classification of infrared Gaussian fixed\npoints available to describe NG modes in nonrelativistic theories. Generic\ninteractions in such theories break the polynomial shift symmetry explicitly to\nthe constant shift. It is thus natural to ask: Given a Gaussian fixed point\nwith polynomial shift symmetry of degree $P$, what are the lowest-dimension\noperators that preserve this symmetry, and deform the theory into a\nself-interacting scalar field theory with the shift symmetry of degree $P$? To\nanswer this (essentially cohomological) question, we develop a new\ngraph-theoretical technique, and use it to prove several classification\ntheorems. First, in the special case of $P=1$ (essentially equivalent to\nGalileons), we reproduce the known Galileon $N$-point invariants, and find\ntheir novel interpretation in terms of graph theory, as an equal-weight sum\nover all labeled trees with $N$ vertices.

By exploiting sparsity in the signal model, we derive explicit\ntheoretical guarantees under which both x and D can be recovered exactly,\nrobustly, and numerically efficiently via linear programming.

Experiments on\nkeratocytes suggest that polarization is triggered by the increased\ncontractility of motor proteins but the conditions of re-symmetrization remain\nunknown. In this paper we show that if adhesion with the extra-cellular\nsubstrate is sufficiently low, the progressive intensification of motor-induced\ncontraction may be responsible for both transitions: from static (symmetric) to\nmotile (polarized) at a lower contractility threshold and from motile\n(polarized) back to static (symmetric) at a higher contractility threshold.

In the interest of\nanalytical transparency we also neglect active protrusion and view adhesion as\npassive. Despite the unavoidable oversimplifications associated with these\nassumptions, the model reproduces quantitatively the motility initiation\npattern in fish keratocytes and reveals a crucial role played in cell motility\nby the nonlocal feedback between the mechanics and the transport of active\nagents.

Here we report real-space observations of\nspin configurations of the skyrmion cubic-lattice in MnGe with a very short\nperiod (~3 nm) and hence endowed with the largest skyrmion number density. The\nskyrmion lattices parallel to the {100} atomic lattices are directly observed\nusing Lorentz transmission electron microscopes (Lorentz TEMs). It enables the\nfirst simultaneous observation of magnetic skyrmions and underlying\natomic-lattice fringes. These results indicate the emergence of\nskyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice in MnGe, which is a source of emergent\nelectromagnetic responses and will open a possibility of controlling\nfew-nanometer scale skyrmion lattices through atomic lattice modulations.\n"]}]

Despite many proposals and major\nexperimental efforts, so far it has not been possible to prepare the ground\nstate of this system. Here we report the observation of Bose-Einstein\ncondensation for the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian with one-half flux quantum\nper lattice unit cell. The diffraction pattern of the superfluid state directly\nshows the momentum distribution on the wavefuction, which is gauge-dependent.\nIt reveals both the reduced symmetry of the vector potential and the twofold\ndegeneracy of the ground state.

It is apparent that disk\nclearing progresses from the inside-out on a short time scale and models of\nphotoevaporation are frequently used to explain this. However, the\nphotoevaporation rates predicted by models differ by up to two orders of\nmagnitude, resulting in uncertain time scales for the final stages of disk\nclearing. Photoevaporation theories predict that the final stages of\ndisk-clearing progress in objects that have ceased accretion but still posses\nconsiderable material at radii far from the star. Weak-line T Tauri stars\n(WTTS) with infrared excess are likely in this configuration. We aim to provide\nobservational constraints on theories of disk-clearing by measuring the dust\nmasses and CO content of a sample of young (1.8-26.3 Myr) WTTS. We used ALMA\nBand 6 to obtain continuum and 12 CO(2-1) line fluxes for a sample of 24 WTTS\nstars with known infrared excess. We detect continuum emission in only four of\n24 WTTS, and no 12 CO(2-1) emission in any. For those WTTS where no continuum\nwas detected, their ages and derived upper limits suggest they are debris\ndisks, which makes them some of the youngest debris disks known. Of those where\ncontinuum was detected, three are possible photoevaporating disks, although the\nlack of CO detection suggests a severely reduced gas-to-dust ratio. The low\nfraction of continuum detections implies that, once accretion onto the star\nstops, the clearing of the majority of dust progresses very rapidly. Most WTTS\nwith infrared excess are likely not in transition but are instead young debris\ndisks, whose dust is either primordial and has survived disk-clearing, or is of\nsecond-generation origin.\n","Comment: submitted to A&A"]}]

As the network density is expected to\ndrastically increase in order to accommodate the exponentially growing mobile\ndata traffic, performance optimization problems are entering a new era\ncharacterized by a high dimension and/or a large number of constraints, which\nposes significant design and computational challenges. In this paper, we\npresent a novel two-stage approach to solve large-scale convex optimization\nproblems for dense wireless cooperative networks, which can effectively detect\ninfeasibility and enjoy modeling flexibility. In the proposed approach, the\noriginal large-scale convex problem is transformed into a standard cone\nprogramming form in the first stage via matrix stuffing, which only needs to\ncopy the problem parameters such as channel state information (CSI) and\nquality-of-service (QoS) requirements to the pre-stored structure of the\nstandard form. The capability of yielding infeasibility certificates and\nenabling parallel computing is achieved by solving the homogeneous self-dual\nembedding of the primal-dual pair of the standard form. In the solving stage,\nthe operator splitting method, namely, the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM), is adopted to solve the large-scale homogeneous self-dual\nembedding. Compared with second-order methods, ADMM can solve large-scale\nproblems in parallel with modest accuracy within a reasonable amount of time.\nSimulation results will demonstrate the speedup, scalability, and reliability\nof the proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art modeling\nframeworks and solvers.\n","Comment: to appear in IEEE Trans.

We find that the maximum efficiency is similar for\nboth current directions within the error bars, which is in line with a\ndominating damping-like spin-orbit torque (SOT) and indicates that no large\nadditional torques arise for currents parallel to the DW. Finally, we find a\nvarying dependence of the maximum depinning efficiency angle for different DWs\nand pinning levels. This emphasizes the importance of our full angular scans\ncompared to previously used measurements for just two field directions\n(parallel and perpendicular to the DW) and shows the sensitivity of the\nspin-orbit torque to the precise DW structure and pinning sites.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures"]}]

We consider two samples of galaxies: the Dwarf\nGalaxy Survey (DGS) and KINGFISH, totalling 109 galaxies, spanning almost 2 dex\nin metallicity. We collect infrared (IR) to submillimetre (submm) data for both\nsamples and present the complete data set for the DGS sample. We model the\nobserved spectral energy distributions (SED) with a physically-motivated dust\nmodel to access the dust properties. Using a different SED model (modified\nblackbody), dust composition (amorphous carbon), or wavelength coverage at\nsubmm wavelengths results in differences in the dust mass estimate of a factor\ntwo to three, showing that this parameter is subject to non-negligible\nsystematic modelling uncertainties. For eight galaxies in our sample, we find a\nrather small excess at 500 microns (< 1.5 sigma). We find that the dust SED of\nlow-metallicity galaxies is broader and peaks at shorter wavelengths compared\nto more metal-rich systems, a sign of a clumpier medium in dwarf galaxies. The\nPAH mass fraction and the dust temperature distribution are found to be driven\nmostly by the specific star-formation rate, SSFR, with secondary effects from\nmetallicity. The correlations between metallicity and dust mass or total-IR\nluminosity are direct consequences of the stellar mass-metallicity relation.\nThe dust-to-stellar mass ratios of metal-rich sources follow the well-studied\ntrend of decreasing ratio for decreasing SSFR. The relation is more complex for\nhighly star-forming low-metallicity galaxies and depends on the chemical\nevolutionary stage of the source (i.e., gas-to-dust mass ratio).

Additionally,\nthe full time series, and different segments thereof are analyzed. For more\nthan 18,500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from\nMcQuillan et al. (2014). Thereof, more than 12,300 stars show multiple\nsignificant peaks, which we interpret as DR. Gyrochronology ages between 100\nMyr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17,000 stars using different\ngyrochronology relations. We find a bimodal age distribution for Teff between\n3200-4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using\nphotometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079\nstars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may\nbe associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other\nhalf might be due to pulsations. The derived gyrochronology ages are well\nconstrained since more than 93.0 % of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun\nwhere calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age\ndistribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The\nexistence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than\nthree years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar\ncompanions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely\nstable.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 15 figures; Tables 2 & 4 will entirely be available\n  (later...)"]}]

Studies of nearby starbursts have shown that Lyman continuum\nand line emission are absorbed by dust and that the Lyman-alpha is resonantly\nscattered by neutral hydrogen. A source of feedback is required to prevent\nscattering and allow the Lyman-alpha emission to escape. There are two X-ray\npoint sources embedded in the Lyman Break Analog (LBA) galaxy Haro 11.

Haro 11 X-1 is similar to the\nextreme Black Hole Binary (BHB) M82 X-1. The hard X-ray spectrum indicates Haro\n11 X-1 may be a Black Hole Binary (BHB) in a low accretion state.

Conventional\nmethods often study these two steps separately, e.g., learning hash functions\nfrom a predefined hand-crafted feature space. Meanwhile, the bit lengths of\noutput hashing codes are preset in most previous methods, neglecting the\nsignificance level of different bits and restricting their practical\nflexibility. To address these issues, we propose a supervised learning\nframework to generate compact and bit-scalable hashing codes directly from raw\nimages. We pose hashing learning as a problem of regularized similarity\nlearning. Specifically, we organize the training images into a batch of triplet\nsamples, each sample containing two images with the same label and one with a\ndifferent label. With these triplet samples, we maximize the margin between\nmatched pairs and mismatched pairs in the Hamming space. In addition, a\nregularization term is introduced to enforce the adjacency consistency, i.e.,\nimages of similar appearances should have similar codes. The deep convolutional\nneural network is utilized to train the model in an end-to-end fashion, where\ndiscriminative image features and hash functions are simultaneously optimized.\nFurthermore, each bit of our hashing codes is unequally weighted so that we can\nmanipulate the code lengths by truncating the insignificant bits. Our framework\noutperforms state-of-the-arts on public benchmarks of similar image search and\nalso achieves promising results in the application of person re-identification\nin surveillance. It is also shown that the generated bit-scalable hashing codes\nwell preserve the discriminative powers with shorter code lengths.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures.

Despite the fixed load, the number and structure of the confined IL\nlayers changes with changing charge, and that in turn drives strong friction\nvariations. The latter involve first of all charging-induced freezing of the IL\nfilm, followed by a discharging-induced melting, both made possible by the\nnanoscale confinement. Another mechanism for charging-induced frictional\nchanges is a shift of the plane of maximum shear from mid-film to the\nplate-film interface, and viceversa.

Several post-formation\nprocesses have been proposed for explaining the origin of the compositional\ndiversity: the mass loss via stellar XUV irradiation, degassing of accreted\nmaterial, and in-situ accumulation of the disk gas. Close-in planets are also\nlikely to experience giant impacts during the advanced stage of planet\nformation. This study examines the possibility of transforming volatile-rich\nsuper-Earths / mini-Neptunes into volatile-depleted super-Earths through giant\nimpacts. We present the results of three-dimensional giant impact simulations\nin the accretionary and disruptive regimes. Target planets are modeled with a\nthree-layered structure composed of an iron core, silicate mantle and\nhydrogen/helium envelope. In the disruptive case, the giant impact can remove\nmost of the H/He atmosphere immediately and homogenize the refractory material\nin the planetary interior. In the accretionary case, the planet can retain more\nthan half of the gaseous envelope, while a compositional gradient suppresses\nefficient heat transfer as its interior undergoes double-diffusive convection.\nAfter the giant impact, a hot and inflated planet cools and contracts slowly.\nThe extended atmosphere enhances the mass loss via both a Parker wind induced\nby thermal pressure and hydrodynamic escape driven by the stellar XUV\nirradiation. As a result, the entire gaseous envelope is expected to be lost\ndue to the combination of those processes in both cases. We propose that\nKepler-36b may have been significantly devolatilized by giant impacts, while a\nsubstantial fraction of Kepler-36c's atmosphere may remain intact. Furthermore,\nthe stochastic nature of giant impacts may account for the large dispersion in\nthe mass--radius relationship of close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, to be published in ApJ, readability\n  improved according to the proof"]}]

High-resolution\nrotational molecular spectroscopy has been employed to extend the available\ndataset of four isotopic species, SO, $^{34}$SO, S$^{17}$O, and S$^{18}$O up to\nthe 1.5 THz region. The frequency coverage and the spectral resolution of our\nmeasurements allowed a better constraint of the molecular constants of the four\nspecies considered, focusing especially for the two oxygen substituted\nisotopologues. Our measurements were also employed in an isotopically invariant\nfit including all available pure rotational and ro-vibrational transitions for\nall SO isotopologues, thus enabling accurate predictions for rotational\ntransitions at higher frequencies. Comparison with recent works performed on\nthe same system are also provided, showing the quality of our experiment and\nthe improvement of the datasets for all the species here considered. Transition\nfrequencies for this system can now be used with confidence by the astronomical\ncommunity well into the THz spectral region.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 3 figures, to be published in ApJ"]}]

The large/small (e1/e3) eigenvalues of the\nhessian matrix define the fast/slow collapse direction of dark matter on large\nscale.

On a theoretical\nground, the response of gas to a bar is generally thought to cause nuclear\nstarbursts and, possibly, AGN activity once the perturbed gas reaches the\ncentral super-massive black hole. By means of high resolution numerical\nsimulations we detail the purely dynamical effects that a forming bar exerts on\nthe gas of an isolated disc galaxy. The galaxy is initially unstable to the\nformation of non-axisymmetric structures, and within 1 Gyr it develops spiral\narms that eventually evolve into a central stellar bar on kpc scale. A first\nmajor episode of gas inflow occurs during the formation of the spiral arms\nwhile at later times, when the stellar bar is establishing, a low density\nregion is carved between the bar co-rotational and inner Lindblad resonance\nradii. The development of such \"dead zone\" inhibits further massive gas\ninflows. Indeed, the gas inflow reaches its maximum during the relatively fast\nbar formation phase and not, as often assumed, when the bar is fully formed. We\nconclude that the low efficiency of long-lived, evolved bars in driving gas\ntoward galactic nuclei is the reason why observational studies have failed to\nestablish an indisputable link between bars and AGNs. On the other hand, the\nhigh efficiency in driving strong gas inflows of the intrinsically transient\nprocess of bar formation suggests that the importance of bars as drivers of AGN\nactivity in disc galaxies has been overlooked so far.

In all cases, we obtain a Bell\ninequality violation, whose value depends on the demultiplexer features.

Rotating superfluid\nhelium can support rectilinear quantized line vortices, which in certain\nregimes are accurately modeled by point vortices.

The ringlet\nis mainly composed of micron-sized particles (Showalter, 1991, Hedman et al.,\n2011), implying that these particles may be significantly perturbed by\nnon-gravitational forces, which can limit their lifetimes. We establish a\nkinetic model considering the birth, evolution, and death of dust in the Encke\ncentral ringlet allowing to evaluate the ringlet optical depth. First, we\ninvestigate the generation of dust by micrometeorite impacts (the\n`impact-ejecta' process) on putative, yet undetected embedded moonlets. Taking\ninto account the orbital evolution under the influence of the relevant\nperturbation forces, the dominant loss mechanisms are collisions with ring\nparticles in the gap edges, the putative moonlets in the gap, or erosion by\nsputtering in Saturn's plasma environment. However, our results show that this\nimpact-ejecta process alone can only sustain a ringlet of optical depth 3-4\norders of magnitude smaller than the observed values. Consequently, other\nprocesses must be taken into account. For example, mutual collisions among\nputative moonlets should produce dust at about the same rate, while further\ndisruption of ejecta, as proposed by Dikarev (1999), should increase the total\namount of particles. Furthermore, observations show an azimuthal asymmetry of\nthe material in the Encke gap ringlets (Ferrari and Brahic 1997, M.\nSrem\\v{c}evi\\'c, private communication).

The simulation results indicate that agents with\nsimilar traits aggregate to form community by homophily, while heterophily\nplays a major role in the formation of inter-communal links. The pattern of\nnetwork evolution revealed in simulations is essentially consistent with what\nis observed in empirical analyses, as in both cases the giant component evolves\nfrom a small cluster to a structure of chained-communities, and then to a small\nworld network with community structure. This work may provides an alternative\nview on the underlying mechanisms for the formation of community and small\nworld structures, complementary to the mainstream view that the small-world is\ngenerated from the combination of the structural embeddedness and structural\nholes mechanisms.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, working paper"]}]
