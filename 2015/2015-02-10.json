In other words, when $S$ and $\\phi$ are related by\n$\\phi = \\exp \\left(-\\frac{S}{\\tau} \\right)$ and $\\phi$ satisfies a specific\nlinear differential equation corresponding to the extremum of a variational\nproblem, we obtain the approximate Euclidean distance function $S = -\\tau\n\\log(\\phi)$ which converges to the true solution in the limit as $\\tau\n\\rightarrow 0$. This is in sharp contrast to techniques like the fast marching\nand fast sweeping methods which directly solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation by\nthe Godunov upwind discretization scheme. Our linear formulation results in a\nclosed-form solution to the approximate Euclidean distance function expressible\nas a discrete convolution, and hence efficiently computable using the fast\nFourier transform (FFT).

As $\\tau\\rightarrow0$ we show the\nconvergence of our results to the true solution and also bound the error for a\ngiven value of $\\tau$. The differentiability of our solution allows us to\ncompute---using a set of convolutions---the first and second derivatives of the\napproximate distance function.

Ellipsoidal particles are\nknown to be more efficient stabilizers of fluid interfaces than spherical\nparticles and their anisotropic shape and the related additional rotational\ndegrees of freedom have an impact on the dynamics of emulsion formation. In\nthis paper, we investigate this point by means of simple model systems\nconsisting of a single ellipsoidal particle or a particle ensemble at a flat\ninterface as well as a particle ensemble at a spherical interface. By applying\ncombined multicomponent lattice Boltzmann and molecular dynamics simulations we\ndemonstrate that the anisotropic shape of ellipsoidal particles causes two\nadditional timescales to be of relevance in the dynamics of emulsion formation:\na relatively short timescale can be attributed to the adsorption of single\nparticles and the involved rotation of particles towards the interface. As soon\nas the interface is jammed, however, capillary interactions between the\nparticles cause a local reordering on very long timescales leading to a\ncontinuous change in the interface configuration and increase of interfacial\narea.

We derive the general analytic form of the evolution of the key\ngalaxy properties, i.e. gas mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass,\nspecific SFR, gas fraction, gas phase metallicity and stellar metallicity,\nwithout assuming that galaxies live in the equilibrium state. We find that the\ntimescale required to reach equilibrium, tau_eq, which is determined by the\nproduct of star-formation efficiency and mass-loading factor, is the central\nparameter that is essentially in control of the evolution of all key galaxy\nproperties. The scatters in most of the key scaling relations, such as the\nmass-SFR relation and mass-metallicity relation, are primarily governed by\ntau_eq. Most strikingly, the predicted sSFR evolution is controlled solely by\ntau_eq (apart from the cosmic time). Although the precise evolution of the sSFR\ndepends on tau_eq, the sSFR history is largely insensitive to different values\nof tau_eq. The difference between the minimum and maximum sSFR at any epoch is\nless than a factor of four. The shape of the predicted sSFR history simply\nmimics that of the specific mass increase rate of the dark matter halos\n(sMIR_DM) with the typical value of the sSFR around 2*sMIR_DM, in good\nagreement with the predictions from typical Semi-Analytic Models (SAMs), but\nboth are fundamentally different from the observed sSFR history. This clearly\nimplies that some key process is missing in both typical SAMs and gas regulator\nmodel, and we hint at some possible culprit.

The central idea is to apply the diffusion maps algorithm to a\ntraining data set to produce a stochastic matrix whose generator is a discrete\napproximation to the backward Kolmogorov operator of the underlying dynamics.\nThe eigenvectors of this stochastic matrix, which we will refer to as the\ndiffusion coordinates, are discrete approximations to the eigenfunctions of the\nKolmogorov operator and form an orthonormal basis for functions defined on the\ndata set. Using this basis, we consider the projection of three uncertainty\nquantification (UQ) problems (prediction, filtering, and response) into the\ndiffusion coordinates. In these coordinates, the nonlinear prediction and\nresponse problems reduce to solving systems of infinite-dimensional linear\nordinary differential equations. Similarly, the continuous-time nonlinear\nfiltering problem reduces to solving a system of infinite-dimensional linear\nstochastic differential equations. Solving the UQ problems then reduces to\nsolving the corresponding truncated linear systems in finitely many diffusion\ncoordinates. By solving these systems we give a model-free algorithm for UQ on\ngradient flow systems with isotropic diffusion. We numerically verify these\nalgorithms on a 1-dimensional linear gradient flow system where the analytic\nsolutions of the UQ problems are known.

Second, multi-topicality indicates\nthat a document has a broad discussion of multi-topics, rather than single\ntopic.

Apart from the benefits, existing TA\ndesign also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions\nwith students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of\nbelievability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive\nlearning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA,\nAffective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and\nimplement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with\nstudents with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of\npedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory\nto design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors\nof students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to\nlearn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and\nAffectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage\nthem to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can\ninteract with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the\nagent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an\neducator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent\ncan perform as an authoring tool.

The first one is to find\na trajectory in the configuration space of a mobile manipulator so as to follow\na given trajectory in the task space. The second objective consists in locally\nadjusting the trajectory in the configuration space in order to avoid\ncollisions with potentially moving obstacles and self-collisions in\nunstructured and dynamic environments. The perception is exclusively based on a\nset of proximity sensors distributed on the robot mechanical structure and\nvisual information are not required. Thanks to the adoption of this kind of\nproximity distributed perception, the approach does not require a 3D model of\nthe robot and allows the real-time collision avoidance without the need of a\nsensorized environment. To achieve the features cited above, a behaviour-based\ntechnique known as Null-Space-Based (NSB) approach has been adopted with some\nmodifications.On one hand, the concept of a total pseudo-energy based on the\ninformation from the distributed sensors has been introduced. On the other\nhand, a method to combine different tasks has been proposed to guarantee the\nsmoothness of the realtime trajectory adjustments. Another significant feature\nof the method is the strict coordination between the base and the arm\nexploiting the redundant degrees of freedom, that is a relevant topic in mobile\nmanipulation.\n","Comment: Master's Thesis"]}]

First, we considered several increasingly complex boosted\nregression trees (BRT), a convenient and efficient multiple regression model\nfrom the statistical learning field. Further, we considered a robust\ngeostatistical approach coupled to the BRT models. Testing the different\napproaches was performed on the dataset from the French Soil Monitoring\nNetwork, with a consistent cross-validation procedure. We showed that when a\nlimited number of predictors were included in the BRT model, the standalone BRT\npredictions were significantly improved by robust geostatistical modelling of\nthe residuals. However, when data for several SOC drivers were included, the\nstandalone BRT model predictions were not significantly improved by\ngeostatistical modelling. Therefore, in this latter situation, the BRT\npredictions might be considered adequate without the need for geostatistical\nmodelling, provided that i) care is exercised in model fitting and validating,\nand ii) the dataset does not allow for modelling of local spatial\nautocorrelations, as is the case for many national systematic sampling schemes.\n"]}]
