In particular,\nwe calculate a lower bound on the clustering coefficient of the model which is\nindependent of the network size, as seen in real-world networks. More than\ntheoretical analysis, the main properties of the model are evaluated\nempirically and it is shown that the model can precisely simulate real-world\nnetworks from different domains with and different specifications.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables"]}]

It has been shown that these two notions are maximally inequivalent in\na static (metric) sense -- as they coincide only on a set of states of zero\nmeasure. We extend and reinforce quantitatively this inequivalence by\naddressing the dynamical relation between these types of non-classicality in a\nparadigmatic quantum-optical setting: the linear mixing at a beam splitter of a\nsingle-mode Gaussian state with a thermal reference state. Specifically, we\nshow that almost all P-classical input states generate outputs that are not\nC-classical. Indeed, for the case of zero thermal reference photons, the more\nP-classical resources at the input the less C-classicality at the output. In\naddition, we show that the P-classicality at the input -- as quantified by the\nnon-classical depth -- does instead determine quantitatively the potential of\ngenerating output entanglement. This endows the non-classical depth with a new\noperational interpretation: it gives the maximum number of thermal reference\nphotons that can be mixed at a beam splitter without destroying the output\nentanglement.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 10 figures"]}]

Observations\nsince 2009 have been made with new wider-bandwidth spectrometers than were\npreviously employed in this survey. A new data reduction pipeline has been in\nplace since mid-2011 which consists of standard methods using dedispersion,\nsearches for accelerated periodic sources, and search for single pulses, as\nwell as new interference-excision strategies and candidate selection\nheuristics. This pipeline has been used to discover 41 pulsars, including 8\nmillisecond pulsars (MSPs; P < 10 ms), bringing the PALFA survey's discovery\ntotals to 145 pulsars, including 17 MSPs, and one Fast Radio Burst (FRB). The\npipeline presented here has also re-detected 188 previously known pulsars\nincluding 60 found in PALFA data by re-analyzing observations previously\nsearched by other pipelines. A comprehensive description of the survey\nsensitivity, including the effect of interference and red noise, has been\ndetermined using synthetic pulsar signals with various parameters and\namplitudes injected into real survey observations and subsequently recovered\nwith the data reduction pipeline. We have confirmed that the PALFA survey\nachieves the sensitivity to MSPs predicted by theoretical models. However, we\nalso find that compared to theoretical survey sensitivity models commonly used\nthere is a degradation in sensitivity to pulsars with periods P >= 100 ms that\ngradually becomes up to a factor of ~10 worse for P > 4 s at DM < 150 pc/cc.\nThis degradation of sensitivity at long periods is largely due to red noise. We\nfind that 35 +- 3% of pulsars are missed despite being bright enough to be\ndetected in the absence of red noise. This reduced sensitivity could have\nimplications on estimates of the number of long-period pulsars in the Galaxy.\n","Comment: 24 pages, 13 figures, submitted to ApJ"]}]

The radio emission\npeaks at low-frequencies ($\\sim 7$ GHz) at early times, only $2.2$ days after\nthe burst occurred. More notably, the radio spectrum at frequencies above $10$\nGHz exhibits a rather steep cut-off, compared to other long GRB radio\nafterglows. This cut-off can be explained if the emitting electrons are either\nmono-energetic or originate from a rather steep, $dN/dE \\propto E^{-4}$,\npower-law energy distribution. An alternative electron acceleration mechanism\nmay be required to produce such an electron energy distribution. Furthermore,\nthe radio spectrum exhibits a secondary underlying and slowly varying\ncomponent.

Brightness-temperature fluctuations in the 21-cm line during the\ndark ages (z ~ 30-100) are a promising successor to CMB studies, giving access\nto a much larger number of modes.

We show that the secondary\nbispectrum is highly degenerate with the primordial one, and argue that even\npercent-level uncertainties in the amplitude of the former lead to a bias of\norder Delta f_NL ~ 10.

For out-of-plane spins, this Zeeman-like field\nis superimposed by the identical Hartree-Fock effective magnetic fields in the\ntwo valleys, and hence different total effective magnetic fields between two\nvalleys are obtained.

Moreover, at large spin\npolarization and low temperature, due to the weak intravalley hole-phonon\nscattering but relatively strong hole-hole Coulomb scattering, the fast spin\nprecessions are found to result in a quasi hot-hole Fermi distribution\ncharacterized by an effective hot-hole temperature larger than the temperature,\nwhich also enhances the intervalley scattering.

To that end, we argue that in one-graviton\nEinstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes, the graviton with momentum P can be replaced by\na pair of collinear gauge bosons carrying arbitrary momentum fractions xP and\n(1-x)P.\n","Comment: 8 pages"]}]

This releases\ngravitational energy within the AGB envelope, leading to a very asymmetrical\nenvelope ejection, with an irregular and `messy' planetary nebula as a\ndescendant. The evolution of the triple-stellar system can be in a full common\nenvelope evolution (CEE) or in a grazing envelope evolution (GEE). Both before\nand after destruction (if take place) the system might lunch pairs of opposite\njets. One pronounced signature of triple-stellar evolution might be a large\ndeparture from axisymmetrical morphology of the descendant planetary nebula. I\nestimate that about one in eight non-spherical PNe is shaped by one of these\ntriple-stellar evolutionary routes.\n","Comment: Accepted by MNRAS"]}]

We use a gas-grain chemical model including a time-dependent\ntreatment of depletion onto grain surfaces, which strongly influences the gas\ntemperature as the main coolant, CO, depletes from the gas.

The direct detection of exoplanets with high-contrast imaging\nrequires advanced data processing methods to disentangle potential planetary\nsignals from bright quasi-static speckles.

The method presented in this paper, called ANDROMEDA for ANgular\nDifferential OptiMal Exoplanet Detection Algorithm is based on a maximum\nlikelihood approach to ADI and is used to estimate the position and the flux of\nany point source present in the field of view. Aims. In order to optimize and\nexperimentally validate this previously proposed method, we applied ANDROMEDA\nto real VLT/NaCo data.

To assess the performance of the method, we applied ANDROMEDA\non VLT/NaCo data of TYC-8979-1683-1 which is surrounded by numerous bright\nstars and on which we added synthetic planets of known position and flux in the\nfield.

We also identify if the diffuse gas has the same spatial\ndistribution as the high-surface brightness (HSB) HI features detected in the\nVLA maps of these groups by comparing the HI strengths between the observed and\nmodeled masses based on VLA maps. We found that the HI observed with the GBT to\nhave a similar spatial distribution as the HSB structures in HCGs 31 and 68.\nConversely, the observed HI distributions in HCGs44 and 92 were extended and\nshowed significant offsets from the modeled masses. Most of the faint gas in\nHCG44 lies to the Northeast-Southwest region and in HCG 92 lies in the\nNorthwest region of their respective groups. The spatial and dynamical\nsimilarities between the total (faint+HSB) and the HSB HI indicate that the\nfaint gas is of tidal origin.

We find that $P$ and $\\tau$ depend on the\ncombination of $[R/v_{\\rm Ai}, L/R, l/R, \\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e}]$, where $R$\nis the loop radius, $L$ is the looplength, $v_{\\rm Ai}$ is the internal\nAlfv\\'en speed, and $\\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e}$ is the density contrast. For\nall the density profiles examined, $P$ and $\\tau$ experience saturation when\n$L/R \\gg 1$, yielding an inversion curve in the $[R/v_{\\rm Ai}, l/R, \\rho_{\\rm\ni}/\\rho_{\\rm e}]$ space with a specific density profile when $L/R$ is\nsufficiently large. When applied to a spatially unresolved QPP event, the\nscheme yields that $R/v_{\\rm Ai}$ is the best constrained, whereas $l/R$\ncorresponds to the other extreme. For spatially resolved QPPs, while $L/R \\gg\n1$ cannot be assumed beforehand, an inversion curve remains possible due to\nadditional geometrical constraints. When a spatially resolved QPP event\ninvolves another mode, as is the case for a recent event, the full set of\n$[v_{\\rm Ai}, l, \\rho_{\\rm i}/\\rho_{\\rm e}]$ can be inferred.

It has been found that CME apparent mass\nmeasured from the brightness enhancement in coronagraph images shows an\nincreasing trend during its evolution in the corona. However, the physics\nbehind it is not clear. Does the apparent mass gain come from the mass outflow\nfrom the dimming regions in the low corona, or from the pileup of the solar\nwind plasma around the CME when it propagates outwards from the Sun? We\nanalyzed the mass evolution of six CME events. Their mass can increase by a\nfactor of 1.6 to 3.2 from 4 to 15 Rs in the field of view (FOV) of the\ncoronagraph on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Over\nthe distance about 7 to 15 Rs, where the coronagraph occulting effect can be\nnegligible, the mass can increase by a factor of 1.3 to 1.7. We adopted the\n`snow-plough' model to calculate the mass contribution of the piled-up solar\nwind in the height range from about 7 to 15 Rs. For 2/3 of the events, the\nsolar wind pileup is not sufficient to explain the measured mass increase. In\nthe height range from about 7 to 15 Rs, the ratio of the modeled to the\nmeasured mass increase is roughly larger than 0.55. Although the ratios are\nbelieved to be overestimated, the result gives evidence that the solar wind\npileup probably makes a non-negligible contribution to the mass increase. It is\nnot clear yet whether the solar wind pileup is a major contributor to the final\nmass derived from coronagraph observations. However, our study suggests that\nthe solar wind pileup plays increasingly important role in the mass increase as\na CME moves further away from the Sun.\n","Comment: 27 pages, 2 tables, 9 figures, accepted by ApJ"]}]

We use the radiative\ntransfer code MCFOST to create a generic model of a transition disk using\ndifferent grain size distributions and dust masses. From these models we\ngenerate synthetic polarized images at 2.2\\mum. We find that even for moderate\ninclinations (e.g., i = 40degr), multiple scattering alone can produce\nsignificant (up to ~4.5% of the Q_phi image) non-azimuthal polarization\nreflected in the U_phi images. We also find that different grain populations\ncan naturally produce radial polarization (negative values in the Q_phi\nimages). Our results suggest that caution is recommended when interpreting\npolarized images by only analyzing the Q_phi and U_phi images. We find that\nthere can be astrophysical signal in the U_phi images and negative values in\nthe Q_phi images, which indicate departures from azimuthal polarization. If\nsignificant signal is detected in the U_phi images, we recommend to check the\nstandard Q and U images to look for departures from azimuthal polarization. On\nthe positive side, signal in the U_phi images once all instrumental and\ndata-reduction artifacts have been corrected for means that there is more\ninformation to be extracted regarding the dust population and particle density.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A letters.

The limit of the core position as the frequency\napproaches infinity, which suggests a jet base, is separated by 82$\\pm$16\n${\\mu}$as upstream in projection, corresponding to (310$\\pm$60)Rs (Rs:\nSchwarzschild radius) as a deprojected distance, from the 43 GHz core in the\napproaching jet. In addition, the innermost component at the counter jet side\nappeared to approach the same position at infinity of the frequency, indicating\nthat cores on both sides are approaching the same position, suggesting a\nspatial coincidence with the central engine. Applying a phase referencing\ntechnique, we also obtained spectral index maps, which indicate that emission\nfrom the counter jet is affected by free-free absorption (FFA). The result of\nthe core shift profile on the counter jet also requires FFA because the core\npositions at 5-15GHz cannot be explained by a simple core shift model based on\nsynchrotron self-absorption (SSA). Our result is apparently consistent with the\nSSA core shift with an additional disk-like absorber over the counterjet side.\nCore shift and opacity profiles at the counter jet side suggest a two-component\naccretion: a radiatively inefficient accretion flow at the inner region and a\ntruncated thin disk in the outer region.

This equivalence allows for an epistemic\ninterpretation of the standard quantum formalism describing nonrelativistic\nlocalized systems and their correlations, hence a clarification of the origin\nof the finite measures of entanglement between such systems.

In this calculation we have used an\noff-shell matrix element squared calculated using recently developed\ntechniques. The results are compared with our earlier result obtained within\nthe collinear approach. Only slightly larger cross sections are obtained than\nin the case of the collinear approach but still the SPS mechanism contribution\nis much smaller than the DPS one. Inclusion of transverse momenta of gluons\nentering the hard process leads to a much stronger azimuthal decorrelation\nbetween $c c$ and $\\bar c \\bar c$ than in the collinear-factorization approach.\nA comparison to predictions of double parton scattering (DPS) results and the\nLHCb data strongly suggests that the assumption of two fully independent DPS\n($g g \\to c \\bar c \\otimes g g \\to c \\bar c$) may be too approximate.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, talk given by A.

The aim of this paper is to provide novel insights on differences among\nthe ways how different types of human digital trails represent the actual\nmobility patterns and therefore the differences between the approaches\ninterpreting those trails for inferring said patterns. Namely, with the\nemergence of different digital sources that provide information about user\nmobility, it is of vital importance to fully understand that not all of them\ncapture exactly the same picture. With that being said, in this paper we start\nfrom an example showing how human mobility patterns described by means of\nradius of gyration are different for Flickr social network and dataset of bank\ncard transactions. Rather than capturing human movements closer to their homes,\nFlickr more often reveals people travel mode. Consequently, home location\ninferring methods used in both cases cannot be the same. We consider several\nmethods for home location definition known from the literature and demonstrate\nthat although for bank card transactions they provide highly consistent\nresults, home location definition detection methods applied to Flickr dataset\nhappen to be way more sensitive to the method selected, stressing the paramount\nimportance of adjusting the method to the specific dataset being used.\n"]}]

We\nintroduce the following framework. First, we partition the control subdomain\ninto two disjoint open subdomains, with smooth boundaries, that are compatible\nwith the strategy subspaces of the {\\it leader} (which is responsible for the\ncontrollability-type criterion) and that of the {\\it follower} (which is\nassociated with the second criterion), respectively. Moreover, we account at\nthe optimization stage for model uncertainty by allowing the {\\it leader} to\nchoose its control strategy based on a class of alternative models about the\nsystem, whereas the {\\it follower} makes use of an approximate model about the\nsystem. Using the notion of Stackelberg's optimization, we provide conditions\non the existence of optimal control strategies for such a hierarchical control\nproblem, under which the {\\it follower} is required to respond optimally to the\nstrategy of the {\\it leader} so as to achieve the overall objectives.
