And the resulting large sparse linear system from\nthe FE discretization is then solved by the Jacobi-preconditioned Conjugate\nGradient (JCG) method.

Since the initial guess\nfor the iterative solution is a quite good approximation to the FE solution,\nnumerical results show that only few number of iterations are required on the\nfinest grid for ECMG$_{jcg}$ with an appropriate tolerance of the relative\nresidual to achieve full second order accuracy, which is particularly important\nwhen solving large systems of equations and can greatly reduce the\ncomputational cost.

The best approximation ratio known for TAP is $1.5$. In the\nmore general Weighted TAP problem, $F$ should be of minimum weight. Weighted\nTAP admits several $2$-approximation algorithms w.r.t. to the standard cut\nLP-relaxation, but for all of them the performance ratio of $2$ is tight even\nfor TAP. The problem is equivalent to the problem of covering a laminar set\nfamily.

In fact,\nWeighted TAP is the simplest connectivity network design problem for which a\nratio better than $2$ is not known.

Most of the previous theoretical studies have used the\nconstant prefactor determined by the bubble growth due to the evaporation\nprocess from the bubble surface. However, the growth of bubbles is also\nregulated by the thermal conduction, the viscosity, and the inertia of liquid\nmotion. These effects can decrease the prefactor significantly, especially when\nthe liquid pressure is much smaller than the equilibrium one. The deviation in\nthe nucleation rate between the improved formula and the CNT can be as large as\nseveral orders of magnitude. Our improved, accurate prefactor and recent\nadvances in molecular dynamics simulations and laboratory experiments for argon\nbubble nucleation enable us to precisely constrain the free energy barrier for\nbubble nucleation. Assuming the correction to the CNT free energy is of the\nfunctional form suggested by Tolman, the precise evaluations of the free energy\nbarriers suggest the Tolman length is $\\simeq 0.3 \\sigma$ independently of the\ntemperature for argon bubble nucleation, where $\\sigma$ is the unit length of\nthe Lenard-Jones potential.

Using a simple estimator for\nthermodynamic length, thermodynamic states are initialized at approximately\nequal intervals. The method is demonstrated on the Astex diverse set, a\ndatabase of 85 protein-ligand complexes relevant to pharmacy or agriculture.\nFifteen independent simulations of each complex were started using poses from\ncrystallography, docking, or the lowest-energy pose observed in the other\nsimulations. Benchmark simulations completed within three days on a single\nprocessor. Overall, protocols initialized using the thermodynamic length\nestimator were system-specific, robust, and led to approximately even replica\nexchange acceptance probabilities between neighboring states. In most systems,\nthe standard deviation of the BPMF converges to within 5 kT.

Within the thermodynamic cycle, free\nenergies estimated based on multiple intermediate states were more precise, and\nthose estimated by single-step perturbation were less precise.

As a crowd-sourced\nservice, such platforms rely on their users for monitoring and flagging content\nthat violates community rules.\n  Common wisdom is to eliminate the users who receive many flags. Our analysis\nof a year of traces from a mature Q&A site shows that the number of flags does\nnot tell the full story: on one hand, users with many flags may still\ncontribute positively to the community. On the other hand, users who never get\nflagged are found to violate community rules and get their accounts suspended.\nThis analysis, however, also shows that abusive users are betrayed by their\nnetwork properties: we find strong evidence of homophilous behavior and use\nthis finding to detect abusive users who go under the community radar. Based on\nour empirical observations, we build a classifier that is able to detect\nabusive users with an accuracy as high as 83%.\n","Comment: Published in the proceedings of the 24th International World Wide Web\n  Conference (WWW 2015)"]}]
