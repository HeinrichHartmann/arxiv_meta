Recovery rates are usually modelled independently, quite\noften they are even assumed constant. Then, however, the structural connection\nbetween recovery rates and default probabilities is lost and the tails of the\nloss distribution can be underestimated considerably. The problem of\nunderestimating tail losses becomes even more severe, when calibration issues\nare taken into account. To demonstrate this we choose a Merton-type structural\nmodel as our reference system. Diffusion and jump-diffusion are considered as\nunderlying processes. We run Monte Carlo simulations of this model and\ncalibrate different recovery models to the simulation data. For simplicity, we\ntake the default probabilities directly from the simulation data. We compare a\nreduced-form model for recoveries with a constant recovery approach. In\naddition, we consider a functional dependence between recovery rates and\ndefault probabilities. This dependence can be derived analytically for the\ndiffusion case. We find that the constant recovery approach drastically and\nsystematically underestimates the tail of the loss distribution. The\nreduced-form recovery model shows better results, when all simulation data is\nused for calibration.

The\nresearch interest of this paper is to find the vectors as close to the vertices\nas possible in a situation in which noise is added to the data points. Our\nalgorithm is designed to capture the shape of the convex hull of data points by\nusing its enclosing ellipsoid. We show that the algorithm has correctness and\nrobustness properties from theoretical and practical perspectives; correctness\nhere means that if the data points do not contain any noise, the algorithm can\nfind the vertices of their convex hull; robustness means that if the data\npoints contain noise, the algorithm can find the near-vertices. Finally, we\napply the algorithm to document clustering, and report the experimental\nresults.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 6 figures. Minor revisions; Revised Figure 2; Added Table 1"]}]

We model CNTs as discrete elastic structures, whose shape and\nvolume changes are governed by a Reactive Empirical Bond-Order interatomic\npotential of second generation. The kinematical variables we consider are bond\nlengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles; to changes of each of these\nvariables we associate a work-conjugate nanostress. To determine the\nself-stress state in a given CNT, we formulate the load-free equilibrium\nproblem as a minimum problem for the interatomic potential, whose solution\nyields the equilibrium nanostresses; next, by exploiting the nonlinear\nconstitutive dependence we derive for nanostresses in terms of a list of\nkinematical variables, we determine the equilibrium values of the latter;\nfinally, from the equilibrium values of the kinematical variables we deduce the\nnatural geometry and, in particular, the natural radius.

We find that self-stress depends on\nchanges in both bond and dihedral angles in achiral CNTs and, in addition, on\nchanges in bond length in chiral CNTs.

We show that it is\npossible to identify decoupled graphene monolayer, Bernal bilayer, and Bernal\ntrilayer on graphite surface according to their tunnelling spectra in high\nmagnetic field. The decoupled monolayer and bilayer exhibit Landau quantization\nof massless and massive Dirac fermions, respectively. The substrate generates a\nsizable band gap, ~35 meV, in the Bernal bilayer, therefore, the eightfold\ndegenerate Landau level at the charge neutrality point is split into two\nvalley-polarized quartets polarized on each layer. In the decoupled Bernal\ntrilayer, we find that both massless and massive Dirac fermions coexist and its\nlow-energy band structure can be described quite well by taking into account\nonly the nearest-neighbor intra- and interlayer hopping parameters. A strong\ncorrelation between the Fermi velocity of the massless Dirac fermions and the\neffective mass of the massive Dirac fermions is observed in the trilayer. Our\nresult demonstrates that the surface of graphite provides a natural ideal\nplatform to probe the electronic spectra of graphene layers.\n","Comment: 5 figures"]}]

With growing image sizes (2D and 3D), it is now highly desirable to run\nenergy minimization algorithms in parallel. But many existing algorithms, in\nparticular, some efficient combinatorial algorithms, are difficult to\npar-allelize. By exploiting results from convex and submodular theory, we\nreformulate the quadratic energy minimization problem as a total variation\ndenoising problem, which, when viewed geometrically, enables the use of\nprojection and reflection based convex methods. The resulting min-cut algorithm\n(and code) is conceptually very simple, and solves a sequence of TV denoising\nproblems. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing\nstate-of-the-art combinatorial algorithms and convex optimization techniques.\nOn small problems the iterative convex methods match the combinatorial max-flow\nalgorithms, while on larger problems they offer other flexibility and important\ngains: (a) their memory footprint is small; (b) their straightforward\nparallelizability fits multi-core platforms; (c) they can easily be\nwarm-started; and (d) they quickly reach approximately good solutions, thereby\nenabling faster \"inexact\" solutions.

The DOS functional is shown to enjoy natural\nintegral representations on the unit circle and on the unit disk. For random\ncontractions with suitable finite volume approximations, the DOS functional is\nproven to be the almost sure infinite volume limit of the trace per unit volume\nof functions of the finite volume restrictions. Finally, in case the normalised\ncounting measure of the spectrum of the finite volume restrictions converges in\nthe infinite volume limit, the DOS functional is shown admit an integral\nrepresentation on the disk in terms of the limiting measure, despite the\ndiscrepancy between the spectra of non normal operators and their finite volume\nrestrictions.

The method proposed by the\nauthors is used. This method allows to reduce the Cauchy problem for two\nhyperbolic quasilinear PDE's to the Cauchy problem for ODE's. In some respect,\nthis method is analogous to the method of characteristics for two hyperbolic\nequations. The method is effectively applicable in all cases when the explicit\nexpression for the Riemann-Green function of some linear second order PDE,\nresulting from the use of the hodograph method for the original equations, is\nknown. One of the method advantages is the possibility of constructing a\nmulti-valued solutions. Compared with the previous authors paper, in which, in\nparticular, the shallow water equations are studied, here we investigate the\ncase when the Riemann-Green function can be represent as the sum of the terms\neach of them is a product of two multipliers depended on different variables.\nThe numerical results for zonal electrophoresis equations are presented. For\ncomputing the different initial data (periodic, wave packet, the Gaussian\ndistribution) are used.\n","Comment: 23 pages, 17 figures"]}]
