By allowing an arbitrary information exchange pattern, the\nconsidered channel model is a unified one.

Construction of an\nadaptive optimal solution for such problems usually relies either on a singular\nvalue decomposition or representation of the solution via an orthonormal basis.\nThe shortcoming of both approaches lies in the fact that, in many situations,\nneither the eigenbasis of the linear operator nor a standard orthonormal basis\nconstitutes an appropriate collection of functions for sparse representation of\nthe unknown function. In the context of regression problems, there have been an\nenormous amount of effort to recover an unknown function using an overcomplete\ndictionary. One of the most popular methods, Lasso, is based on minimizing the\nempirical likelihood and requires stringent assumptions on the dictionary, the,\nso called, compatibility conditions. While these conditions may be satisfied\nfor the original dictionary functions, they usually do not hold for their\nimages due to contraction imposed by the linear operator. In what follows, we\nbypass this difficulty by a novel approach which is based on inverting each of\nthe dictionary functions and matching the resulting expansion to the true\nfunction, thus, avoiding unrealistic assumptions on the dictionary and using\nLasso in a predictive setting. We examine both the white noise and the\nobservational model formulations and also discuss how exact inverse images of\nthe dictionary functions can be replaced by their approximate counterparts.\nFurthermore, we show how the suggested methodology can be extended to the\nproblem of estimation of a mixing density in a continuous mixture.

Our\nanalysis is mainly based on an extensive spectroscopic dataset of 445 member\ngalaxies, mostly acquired with VIMOS@VLT as part of our ESO Large Programme,\nsampling the cluster out to a radius ~2R200 (4 Mpc).

A number of tests for substructure\ndetection are applied to analyze the galaxy distribution in the velocity space,\nin 2D space, and in 3D projected phase-space. Studied in its entirety, the\ncluster appears as a large-scale relaxed system with a few secondary, minor\noverdensities in 2D distribution.

The\nobservational scenario agrees with MACS J1206.2-0847 having WNW-ESE as the\ndirection of the main cluster accretion, traced by passive galaxies and red\nstrong Hdelta galaxies.

Through extensive experiments, we show that state-of-the-art progress\nindicators (including the one provided by Hadoop) can be seriously harmed by\ndata skewness, load unbalancing, and straggling tasks. This is mainly due to\ntheir implicit assumption that the running time depends linearly on the input\nsize. We thus design a novel profile-guided progress indicator, called\nNearestFit, that operates without the linear hypothesis assumption and exploits\na careful combination of nearest neighbor regression and statistical curve\nfitting techniques. Our theoretical progress model requires fine-grained\nprofile data, that can be very difficult to manage in practice. To overcome\nthis issue, we resort to computing accurate approximations for some of the\nquantities used in our model through space- and time-efficient data streaming\nalgorithms. We implemented NearestFit on top of Hadoop 2.6.0. An extensive\nempirical assessment over the Amazon EC2 platform on a variety of real-world\nbenchmarks shows that NearestFit is practical w.r.t. space and time overheads\nand that its accuracy is generally very good, even in scenarios where\ncompetitors incur non-negligible errors and wide prediction fluctuations.\nOverall, NearestFit significantly improves the current state-of-art on progress\nanalysis for MapReduce.\n"]}]

We show that with an appropriate set of parameters, charge\ncan be transferred against an applied voltage. In this scenario, when the\noscillating piston shifts away from the middle site, the energy of the site\ndecreases and it is populated by a charge transferred from the lower energy\nsite. On the other hand, when the piston returns to close proximity, the energy\nof the middle site increases and it is depopulated by the higher energy site.\nThus through this process, the charge is pumped against the potential gradient.\nOur results can explain the process of proton pumping in one of the\nmitochondrial enzymes, Complex I. Moreover, this mechanism can be used for\nelectron pumping in semiconductor nanostructures.\n"]}]

Methods: We propose a\nsimulation-based estimation approach using the Approximate Bayesian Computation\n(ABC) technique for estimating mean and standard deviation based on various\nsets of summary statistics found in published studies. We conduct a simulation\nstudy to compare the proposed ABC method with the existing methods of Hozo et\nal. (2005), Bland (2015), and Wan et al. (2014). Results: In the estimation of\nthe standard deviation, our ABC method performs best in skewed or heavy-tailed\ndistributions. The average relative error (ARE) approaches zero as sample size\nincreases. In the normal distribution, our ABC performs well. However, the Wan\net al. method is best since it is based on the normal distribution assumption.\nWhen the distribution is skewed or heavy-tailed, the ARE of Wan et al. moves\naway from zero even as sample size increases. In the estimation of the mean,\nour ABC method is best since the AREs converge to zero. Conclusion: ABC is a\nflexible method for estimating the study-specific mean and standard deviation\nfor meta-analysis, especially with underlying skewed or heavy-tailed\ndistributions. The ABC method can be applied using other reported summary\nstatistics such as the posterior mean and 95% credible interval when Bayesian\nanalysis has been employed.\n"]}]

Due to its features, ABE has been\nadopted in several applications, such as encrypted storage or access control\nsystems. Recently, researchers argued about the non acceptable performance of\nABE when implemented on mobile devices. Indeed, the non feasibility of ABE on\nmobile devices would hinder the deployment of novel protocols and\nservices--that could instead exploit the full potential of such devices.\nHowever, we believe the conclusion of non usability was driven by a not-very\nefficient implementation.\n  In this paper, we want to shine a light on this concern by studying the\nfeasibility of applying ABE on smartphone devices. In particular, we\nimplemented AndrABEn, an ABE library for Android operating system. Our library\nis written in the C language and implements two main ABE schemes:\nCiphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, and Key- Policy Attribute-Based\nEncryption. We also run a thorough set of experimental evaluation for AndrABEn,\nand compare it with the current state-of-the-art (considering the same\nexperimental setting). The results confirm the possibility to effectively use\nABE on smartphone devices, requiring an acceptable amount of resources in terms\nof computations and energy consumption. Since the current state-of-the-art\nclaims the non feasibility of ABE on mobile devices, we believe that our study\n(together with the AndrABEn library that we made available online) is a key\nresult that will pave the way for researchers and developers to design and\nimplement novel protocols and applications for mobile devices.\n","Comment: Accepted at the 1st International Workshop on IoT challenges in\n  Mobile and Industrial Systems (IoT-Sys 2015)"]}]
