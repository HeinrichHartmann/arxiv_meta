However, the underlying\nmechanism that drives real networks to be navigable is not yet well understood.\nIn this paper, we present a game theoretic model for the formation of navigable\nsmall world networks. We model the network formation as a Distance-Reciprocity\nBalanced (DRB) game in which people seek for both high reciprocity and\nlong-distance relationships. We show that the game has only two Nash\nequilibria: One is the navigable small-world network, and the other is the\nrandom network in which each node connects with each other node with equal\nprobability. We further show that the navigable small world is very stable ---\n(a) no collusion of any size would benefit from deviating from it; and (b)\nafter an arbitrary deviations of a large random set of nodes, the network would\nreturn to the navigable small world as soon as every node takes one\nbest-response step. In contrast, for the random network, a small group\ncollusion or random perturbations is guaranteed to move the network to the\nnavigable network as soon as every node takes one best-response step. Moreover,\nwe show that navigable small world has much better social welfare than the\nrandom network, and provide the price-of-anarchy and price-of-stability results\nof the game. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the system always\nconverges to the navigable network even when limited or no information about\nother players' strategies is available, and the DRB game simulated on the\nreal-world network leads to navigability characteristic that is very close to\nthat of the real network.

We propose a new paradigm that\ntargets more accurate and more efficient estimation of the costs of paths by\nassociating weights with sub-paths in the road network.

Then, given a departure time and a path, we select an\noptimal subset of learned random variables such that the random variables'\ncorresponding paths together cover the path. This enables accurate joint\ndistribution estimation of the path, and by transferring the joint distribution\ninto a marginal distribution, the travel cost distribution of the path is\nobtained. The use of multiple learned random variables contends with data\nsparseness, the use of multi-dimensional histograms enables compact\nrepresentation of arbitrary joint distributions that fully capture the travel\ncost dependencies among the edges in paths.

We show that in most cases the\nnon-linearity in the {\\mu}(p) relation is mainly due to process (e) (frictional\nheating), which softens the rubber, increases the area of contact, and (in most\ncases) reduces the viscoelastic contribution to the friction. In fact, since\nthe temperature distribution in the rubber at time t depends on on the sliding\nhistory (i.e., on the earlier time t0 < t), the friction coefficient at time t\nwill also depend on the sliding history, i.e. it is, strictly speaking, a time\nintegral operator. The energy dissipation in the contact regions between solids\nin sliding contact can result in high local temperatures which may strongly\naffect the area of real contact and the friction force (and the wear-rate).\nThis is the case for rubber sliding on road surfaces at speeds above 1 mm/s. In\nRef. [14] we have derived equations which describe the frictional heating for\nsolids with arbitrary thermal properties. In this paper the theory is applied\nto rubber friction on road surfaces.
