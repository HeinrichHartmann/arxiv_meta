However, it is not yet clear whether\ndephasing can enhance transport in an interacting many-body system. Here, we\naddress this question by analyzing the transport properties of a boundary\ndriven spinless fermion chain with nearest-neighbor interactions subject to\nbulk dephasing. The many-body nonequilibrium stationary state is determined\nusing large-scale matrix product simulations of the corresponding quantum\nmaster equation. We find dephasing enhanced transport only in the strongly\ninteracting regime, where it is shown to induce incoherent transitions bridging\nthe gap between bound dark states and bands of mobile eigenstates. The generic\nnature of the transport enhancement is illustrated by a simple toy model, which\ncontains the basic elements required for its emergence. Surprisingly, the\neffect is significant even in the linear response regime of the full system,\nand it is predicted to exist for any large and finite chain. The response of\nthe system to dephasing also establishes a signature of an underlying\nnonequilibrium phase transition between regimes of transport degradation and\nenhancement. The existence of this transition is shown not to depend on the\nintegrability of the model considered. As a result, dephasing enhanced\ntransport is expected to persist in more realistic nonequilibrium strongly\ncorrelated systems.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 17 figures"]}]

The term effect indicates that it\nrepresents causal information, which is different from standard statistical\nconcepts as regression coefficient and association. The process of inferring\ncausal information is also different from standard statistical learning, as the\nformer requires causal (i.e. non-statistical) assumptions and involves extra\ncomplexities. Remarkably, the task of inferring genetic effects is largely seen\nas a standard regression/prediction problem, contradicting its label. This\nwidely accepted analysis approach is by itself insufficient for causal\nlearning, suggesting that causality is not the point for selection. Given this\nincongruence, it is important to verify if genomic predictors need to represent\ncausal effects to be relevant for selection decisions, especially because\napplying regression studies to answer causal questions may lead to wrong\nconclusions. The answer to this question defines if genomic selection models\nshould be constructed aiming maximum genomic predictive ability or aiming\nidentifiability of genetic causal effects. Here, we demonstrate that selection\nrelies on a causal effect from genotype to phenotype, and that genomic\npredictors are only useful for selection if they distinguish such effect from\nother sources of association. Conversely, genomic predictors capturing\nnon-causal signals provide information that is less relevant for selection\nregardless of the resulting predictive ability. Focusing on covariate choice\ndecision, simulated examples are used to show that predictive ability, which is\nthe criterion normally used to compare models, may not indicate the quality of\ngenomic predictors for selection.

Usually, such generalization are obtained\nby introducing a \"relaxation\" variable, where the original problem corresponds\nto setting this variable to a constant value. For instance, the problem of\npacking sets of size at most $p$ into a given universe generalizes the Maximum\nMatching problem, which is recovered by taking $p=2$. Most often, the\ncomplexity of the problem increases with the relaxation variable, but very\nrecently Abasi et al. have given a surprising example of a problem ---\n$r$-Simple $k$-Path --- that can be solved by a randomized algorithm with\nrunning time $O^*(2^{O(k \\frac{\\log r}{r})})$. That is, the complexity of the\nproblem decreases with $r$. In this paper we pursue further the direction\nsketched by Abasi et al. Our main contribution is a derandomization tool that\nprovides a deterministic counterpart of the main technical result of Abasi et\nal.: the $O^*(2^{O(k \\frac{\\log r}{r})})$ algorithm for $(r,k)$-Monomial\nDetection, which is the problem of finding a monomial of total degree $k$ and\nindividual degrees at most $r$ in a polynomial given as an arithmetic circuit.\nOur technique works for a large class of circuits, and in particular it can be\nused to derandomize the result of Abasi et al. for $r$-Simple $k$-Path. On our\nway to this result we introduce the notion of representative sets for\nmultisets, which may be of independent interest.

CAWSES II was planned to examine the behavior of the\nsolar terrestrial system as the solar activity climbed to its maximum phase in\nsolar cycle 24. After a deep minimum following cycle 23, the Sun climbed to a\nvery weak maximum in terms of the sunspot number in cycle 24 (MiniMax24), so\nmany of the results presented here refer to this weak activity in comparison\nwith cycle 23. The short term variability that has immediate consequence to\nEarth and geospace manifests as solar eruptions from closed field regions and\nhigh speed streams from coronal holes. Both electromagnetic (flares) and mass\nemissions (coronal mass ejections, CMEs) are involved in solar eruptions, while\ncoronal holes result in high speed streams that collide with slow wind forming\nthe so called corotating interaction regions (CIRs). Fast CMEs affect Earth via\nleading shocks accelerating energetic particles and creating large geomagnetic\nstorms.

Indeed, the light curves of the two\nflares show both a different structure and peak energy flux ($9.6 \\pm1.8 \\times\n10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ and $7.1 \\pm1.3 \\times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$, respectively in 2010 and 2014). While the tail of the 2010 flare the\nflux decayed exponentially, in 2014 it persisted at a high level. The\ninterpretation of these differences as well as of the flare themselves is\nsubject of debate.\n","Comment: Conference proceeding.

In a distributed algorithm, an arbitrary\nnumber of processes cooperate to achieve a common goal (e.g., elect a leader).\nProcesses have unique identifiers (pids) from an infinite, totally ordered\ndomain. An algorithm proceeds in synchronous rounds, each round allowing a\nprocess to perform a bounded sequence of actions such as send or receive a pid,\nstore it in some register, and compare register contents wrt. the associated\ntotal order. An algorithm is supposed to be correct independently of the number\nof processes. To specify correctness properties, we introduce a logic that can\nreason about processes and pids. Referring to leader election, it may say that,\nat the end of an execution, each process stores the maximum pid in some\ndedicated register. Since the verification of distributed algorithms is\nundecidable, we propose an underapproximation technique, which bounds the\nnumber of rounds. This is an appealing approach, as the number of rounds needed\nby a distributed algorithm to conclude is often exponentially smaller than the\nnumber of processes.

Most VLBI stations record their\nsignals in a circular basis, but the ALMA receivers record in a linear basis.\nThe strategy that will be followed in the phased-ALMA VLBI observations will be\nto correlate in \"mixed\" basis (i.e., linear versus circular) and convert the\nvisibilities to a pure circular basis after the correlation. We have developed\nan algorithm to perform such a polarization conversion of the VLBI\nvisibilities. In these proceedings, we present the basics of the PolConvert\nalgorithm and discuss on the polarization conversion in the general case were\nsingle dishes (besides phased arrays) record with linear receivers in VLBI\nobservations. We show some results of PolConvert applied to realistic\nsimulations, as well as a test with real VLBI observations at 86\\,GHz between\nthe Onsala radiotelescope (recording in linear basis) and the Effelsberg\nradiotelescope (recording in circular basis).\n","Comment: To appear in the Proceedings of the 12th European VLBI Network\n  Symposium (7-10 Oct 2014, Cagliary, Italy)"]}]

The communication is point-to-point and\nthe cost is the total number of bits exchanged by the protocol, in the worst\ncase, on all edges.\n  Chattopadhyay, Radhakrishnan and Rudra (FOCS'14) recently initiated a study\nof the effect of topology of the network on the total communication cost using\ntools from $L_1$ embeddings. Their techniques provided tight bounds for simple\nfunctions like Element-Distinctness (ED), which depend on the 1-median of the\ngraph. This work addresses two other kinds of natural functions. We show that\nfor a large class of natural functions like Set-Disjointness the communication\ncost is essentially $n$ times the cost of the optimal Steiner tree connecting\nthe terminals.
