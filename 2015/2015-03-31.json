However, the line\nREWs are positively correlated with radio loudness, which suggests that\nrelativistic jets make a negligible contribution to the optical/UV continua of\nthese HRLQs (contrary to the case where the emission lines are diluted by the\nrelativistically boosted continuum). Our HRLQs are generally consistent with\nthe known anti-correlation between radio loudness and X-ray power-law photon\nindex.

We derive the effective $3d-4d$ (or $3d-3d$) superexchange in a Mott\ninsulator with different ionic valencies, underlining the emerging structure of\nthe spin-orbital coupling between the impurity and the host sites and\ndemonstrate that it is qualitatively different from that encountered in the\nhost itself. This derivation shows that the interaction between the host and\nthe impurity depends in a crucial way on the type of doubly occupied $t_{2g}$\norbital. One finds that in some cases, due to the quench of the orbital degree\nof freedom at the $3d$ impurity, the spin and orbital order within the host is\ndrastically modified by doping. The impurity acts either as a spin defect\naccompanied by an orbital vacancy in the spin-orbital structure when the\nhost-impurity coupling is weak, or it favors doubly occupied active orbitals\n(orbital polarons) along the $3d-4d$ bond leading to antiferromagnetic or\nferromagnetic spin coupling. This competition between different magnetic\ncouplings leads to quite different ground states. We find that magnetic\nfrustration and spin degeneracy can be lifted by the quantum orbital flips of\nthe host but they are robust in special regions of the incommensurate phase\ndiagram. The spin-orbit coupling can lead to anisotropic spin and orbital\npatterns along the symmetry directions and cause a radical modification of the\norder imposed by the spin-orbital superexchange. Our findings are expected to\nbe of importance for future theoretical understanding of experimental results\nfor doped $4d$ transition metal oxides doped with $3d^3$ ions.

Our analysis is primary based on a\nMIPS 24$\\mu m$ selected catalogue combining the COSMOS and GOODS surveys.

Formal gradient\nanalysis for spatial processes was elaborated in previous papers, focusing on\ndistribution theory for directional derivatives associated with a response\nvariable assumed to follow a Gaussian process model. In the current work, these\nideas are extended to additionally accommodate a continuous covariate whose\ndirectional derivatives are also of interest and to relate the behavior of the\ndirectional derivatives of the response surface to those of the covariate\nsurface. It is of interest to assess whether, in some sense, the gradients of\nthe response follow those of the explanatory variable. The joint Gaussian\nstructure of all variables, including the directional derivatives, allows for\nexplicit distribution theory and, hence, kriging across the spatial region\nusing multivariate normal theory. Working within a Bayesian hierarchical\nmodeling framework, posterior samples enable all gradient analysis to occur\npost model fitting.

However, existing relational topic models are based on an\nassumption that the number of hidden topics is known in advance, and this is\nimpractical in many real-world applications. Therefore, in order to relax this\nassumption, we propose a nonparametric relational topic model in this paper.\nInstead of using fixed-dimensional probability distributions in its generative\nmodel, we use stochastic processes.

Furthermore, we require that the topics are shared by all\nthe documents. In order to resolve these challenges, we use a subsampling\nstrategy to assign each document a different gamma process from the global\ngamma process, and the subsampling probabilities of documents are assigned with\na Markov Random Field constraint that inherits the document network structure.\nThrough the designed posterior inference algorithm, we can discover the hidden\ntopics and its number simultaneously.
