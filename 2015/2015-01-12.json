Delivering all data in the highest quality format can overload system\nresources. The goal is to make intelligent format selection and routing\ndecisions to maximize time-averaged information quality subject to network\nstability. Lyapunov optimization theory can be used to solve such a problem by\nrepeatedly minimizing the linear terms of a quadratic drift-plus-penalty\nexpression. To reduce delays, this paper proposes a novel extension of this\ntechnique that preserves the quadratic nature of the drift minimization while\nmaintaining a fully separable structure. In addition, to avoid high queuing\ndelay, paths are restricted to at most two hops. The resulting algorithm can\npush average information quality arbitrarily close to optimum, with a trade-off\nin queue backlog. The algorithm compares favorably to the basic\ndrift-plus-penalty scheme in terms of backlog and delay. Furthermore, the\ntechnique is generalized to solve linear programs and yields smoother results\nthan the standard drift-plus-penalty scheme.\n"]}]

We also extract directly from simulation, several\ntravelling waves (TWs). These TWs together with the RPOs are unstable states\nand are believed to provide the skeleton of the chaotic saddle.

A 'long-period' RPO is identified that is only\nvery weakly repelling. Turbulent trajectories are found to frequently approach\nand frequently shadow this orbit. In addition the orbit characterises a\nresulting 'bubble' of chaos, itself a saddle, deep within the turbulent sea\n(Kreilos et al. 2014). We explicitly analyse the merger of the two saddles and\nshow how it results in a considerable increase of the total lifetime. Both\nexits and entries to the bubble are observed, as the stable manifolds of the\ninner and outer saddles intertwine. We observe that the typical lifetime of the\nturbulence is influenced by switches between the inner and outer saddles, and\nis thereby dependent on whether or not it 'shadows' or 'visits' the vicinity of\nthe long-period RPO (Cvitanovic et al. 2014).

However, these systems are prone to partitioning, which\nby Brewer's CAP theorem [1] makes it impossible to use a strong consistency\ncriterion like atomicity. Eventual consistency [2] guaranties that all replicas\neventually converge to a common state when the participants stop updating.\nHowever, it fails to fully specify shared objects and requires additional\nnon-intuitive and error-prone distributed specification techniques, that must\ntake into account all possible concurrent histories of updates to specify this\ncommon state [3]. This approach, that can lead to specifications as complicated\nas the implementations themselves, is limited by a more serious issue. The\nconcurrent specification of objects uses the notion of concurrent events. In\nmessage-passing systems, two events are concurrent if they are enforced by\ndifferent processes and each process enforced its event before it received the\nnotification message from the other process. In other words, the notion of\nconcurrency depends on the implementation of the object, not on its\nspecification. Consequently, the final user may not know if two events are\nconcurrent without explicitly tracking the messages exchanged by the processes.\nA specification should be independent of the system on which it is implemented.\nWe believe that an object should be totally specified by two facets: its\nabstract data type, that characterizes its sequential executions, and a\nconsistency criterion, that defines how it is supposed to behave in a\ndistributed environment. Not only sequential specification helps repeal the\nproblem of intention, it also allows to use the well studied and understood\nnotions of languages and automata. This makes possible to apply all the tools\ndeveloped for sequential systems, from their simple definition using structures\nand classes to the most advanced techniques like model checking and formal\nverification. Eventual consistency (EC) imposes no constraint on the convergent\nstate, that very few depends on the sequential specification. For example, an\nimplementation that ignores all the updates is eventually consistent, as all\nreplicas converge to the initial state.
