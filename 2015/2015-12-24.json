The\nmean fluctuation-induced force acting on the fluid boundaries vanishes in this\nsystem, so we evaluate the two-point, time-dependent force correlations. The\nequal-time correlation function of the forces acting on a single wall gives the\nforce variance, which we show to be finite and independent of the plate\nseparation at large inter-plate distances. The equal-time, cross-plate force\ncorrelation, on the other hand, decays with the inverse inter-plate distance\nand is independent of the fluid viscosity at large distances; it turns out to\nbe negative over the whole range of plate separations, indicating that the two\nbounding plates are subjected to counter-phase correlations. We show that the\ntime-dependent force correlations exhibit damped temporal oscillations for\nsmall plate separations and a more irregular oscillatory behavior at large\nseparations. The long-range hydrodynamic correlations reported here represent a\n\"secondary Casimir effect\", because the mean fluctuation-induced force, which\nrepresents the primary Casimir effect, is absent.\n","Comment: 19 pages, 11 figures, version accepted by Soft Matter, typeset in\n  Physical Review style"]}]

In this situation currency fluctuations clearly introduce a\nsource of risk on CDS spreads. For emerging markets, but in some cases even in\nwell developed markets, the risk of dramatic Foreign Exchange (FX) rate\ndevaluation in conjunction with default events is relevant. We address this\nissue by proposing and implementing a model that considers the risk of foreign\ncurrency devaluation that is synchronous with default of the reference entity.\n  Preliminary results indicate that perceived risks of devaluation can induce a\nsignificant basis across domestic and foreign CDS quotes. For the Republic of\nItaly, a USD CDS spread quote of 440 bps can translate into a EUR quote of 350\nbps in the middle of the Euro-debt crisis in the first week of May 2012. More\nrecently, from June 2013, the basis spreads between the EUR quotes and the USD\nquotes are in the range around 40 bps.\n  We explain in detail the sources for such discrepancies. Our modeling\napproach is based on the reduced form framework for credit risk, where the\ndefault time is modeled in a Cox process setting with explicit diffusion\ndynamics for default intensity/hazard rate and exponential jump to default. For\nthe FX part, we include an explicit default-driven jump in the FX dynamics. As\nour results show, such a mechanism provides a further and more effective way to\nmodel credit / FX dependency than the instantaneous correlation that can be\nimposed among the driving Brownian motions of default intensity and FX rates,\nas it is not possible to explain the observed basis spreads during the\nEuro-debt crisis by using the latter mechanism alone.\n"]}]

Electromotive force was\nfor the most part measured in units of the predominant Daniell cell. Each\ncompany had their own resistance standard. In 1862 the British Association for\nthe Advancement of Science formed a committee to address this situation. By\n1873 they had given definition to the electromagnetic system of units (emu) and\ndefined the practical units of the ohm as ${10}^9$ emu units of resistance and\nthe volt as ${10}^8$ emu units of electromotive force. These recommendations\nwere ratified and expanded upon in a series of international congresses held\nbetween 1881 and 1904. A proposal by Giovanni Giorgi in 1901 took advantage of\na coincidence between the conversion of the units of energy in the emu system\n(the erg) and in the practical system (the joule) in that the same conversion\nfactor existed between the cgs based emu system and a theretofore undefined MKS\nsystem. By introducing another unit, X (where X could be any of the practical\nelectrical units), Giorgi demonstrated that a self consistent MKSX system was\ntenable without the need for multiplying factors. Ultimately the ampere was\nselected as the fourth unit. It took nearly 60 years, but in 1960 Giorgi's\nproposal was incorporated as the core of the newly inaugurated International\nSystem of Units (SI). This article surveys the physics, physicists and events\nthat contributed to those developments.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 1 table.

Secondly, IRI can also be used to further\nincrease the level of harm of the jamming signal to the eavesdroppers. By\nexploiting the fact that the jamming signal can be stored at the relay nodes,\nwe also propose a hybrid algorithm to set a signal-to-interference and noise\nratio (SINR) threshold at the node to determine the type of signal stored at\nthe relay node. With this separation, the signals with high SINR are delivered\nto the users as conventional relay systems and the low SINR performance signals\nare stored as potential jamming signals.

A version of the Tutte linear relation for the flow\npolynomial at $(3-\\sqrt{5})/2$ is shown to give a planarity criterion for\n$3$-connected cubic graphs. A conjecture is formulated that the golden identity\nfor the flow polynomial characterizes planarity of cubic graphs as well. In\naddition, Tutte's upper bound on the chromatic polynomial of planar\ntriangulations at $(3+\\sqrt{5})/2$ is generalized to other Beraha numbers, and\nan exponential lower bound is given for the value at $(3-\\sqrt{5})/2$. The\nproofs of these results rely on the structure of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and\nmore generally on methods of topological quantum field theory.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 14 figures"]}]

As the\npressure in the liquid is gradually reduced, air penetrates from an open inlet,\ndisplacing the liquid which leaves the system from an outlet on the opposite\nside.

It is defined from an optimal sequence of edit\noperations (edit path) transforming one graph into an other. Unfortunately, the\nexact computation of this measure is NP-hard. In the last decade, several\napproaches have been proposed to approximate the GED in polynomial time, mainly\nby solving linear programming problems.

However, they fail to\nconsider potential unbalance in the network utilization, which in some cases\nresults in suboptimal designs. Based on an appropriate cost model, this paper\nadvocates the use of networks based on incidence graphs of projective planes,\nbroadly denoted as Projective Networks. Projective Networks rely on highly\nsymmetric generalized Moore graphs and encompass several proposed direct (PN\nand demi-PN) and indirect (OFT) topologies under a common mathematical\nframework. Compared to other proposals with average distance between 2 and 3\nhops, these networks provide very high scalability while preserving a balanced\nnetwork utilization, resulting in low network costs. Overall, Projective\nNetworks constitute a competitive alternative for exascale-level\ninterconnection network design.\n"]}]
