However, the correspondingly high gas\ndensities also lead to efficient cluster disruption by impulsive tidal shocks,\nwhich limits the survival of GCs progenitor clusters.

Based on the excellent\nlocalization property in the spacial domain further, we also prove that all the\n$l^{q}$ $(01\\leq q < \\infty)$ kernel regularization estimates associated with\nthe needlet kernel, including the kernel lasso estimate and the kernel bridge\nestimate, possess almost the same generalization capability for a large range\nof regularization parameters in the sense of rate optimality.\n  This finding tentatively reveals that, if the needlet kernel is utilized,\nthen the choice of $q$ might not have a strong impact in terms of the\ngeneralization capability in some modeling contexts. From this perspective, $q$\ncan be arbitrarily specified, or specified merely by other no generalization\ncriteria like smoothness, computational complexity, sparsity, etc..\n","Comment: 21 pages"]}]

The\npartial gathering problem is a new generalization of the total gathering\nproblem. The partial gathering problem requires, for a given integer $g$, that\neach agent should move to a node and terminate so that at least $g$ agents\nshould meet at the same node. The requirement for the partial gathering problem\nis weaker than that for the (well-investigated) total gathering problem, and\nthus, we have interests in clarifying the difference on the move complexity\nbetween them. We propose three algorithms to solve the partial gathering\nproblem. The first algorithm is deterministic but requires unique ID of each\nagent.

This algorithm achieves\nthe partial gathering in expected $O(gn)$ total moves. The third algorithm is\ndeterministic and requires no unique ID of each agent. For this case, we show\nthat there exist initial configurations in which no algorithm can solve the\nproblem and agents can achieve the partial gathering in $O(kn)$ total moves for\nsolvable initial configurations, where $k$ is the number of agents.

The whole PFN\ncan be easily trained in an end-to-end way without the requirement of a\nproposal generation stage. Extensive evaluations on the challenging PASCAL VOC\n2012 semantic segmentation benchmark demonstrate that the proposed PFN solution\nwell beats the state-of-the-arts for instance-level object segmentation. In\nparticular, the $AP^r$ over 20 classes at 0.5 IoU reaches 58.7% by PFN,\nsignificantly higher than 43.8% and 46.3% by the state-of-the-art algorithms,\nSDS [9] and [16], respectively.\n","Comment: 14 pages"]}]

When beginning our WR searches using infrared techniques\nit was not clear whether WR number predictions were too optimistic or whether\nthere was more hidden behind interstellar and circumstellar extinction. During\nthe last decade we pioneered a technique of exploiting the near- and\nmid-infrared continuum colours for individual point sources provided by\nlarge-format surveys of the Galaxy, including 2MASS and Spitzer/GLIMPSE, to\npierce through the dust and reveal newly discovered WR stars throughout the\nGalactic Plane. The key item to the colour discrimination is via the\ncharacteristic infrared spectral index produced by the strong winds of the WR\nstars, combined with dust extinction, which place WR stars in a relatively\ndepopulated area of infrared colour-colour diagrams. The use of the\nSpitzer/GLIMPSE 8$\\mu$m and, more recently, WISE 22$\\mu$m fluxes together with\ncross-referencing with X-ray measurements in selected Galactic regions have\nenabled improved candidate lists that increased our confirmation success rate,\nachieved via follow-up infrared and optical spectroscopy.

When conditioning on\nvarious wind direction sectors, the dynamics of the conversion process appear\nas a fluctuating trajectory around an average IEC-like power curve, see section\nII. Our approach is to consider the wind farm as a dynamical system that can be\ndescribed as a stochastic drift/diffusion model, where a drift coefficient\ndescribes the attraction towards the power curve and a diffusion coefficient\nquantifies additional turbulent fluctuations. These stochastic coefficients are\ninserted into a Langevin equation that, once properly adapted to our particular\nsystem, models a synthetic signal of power output for any given wind\nspeed/direction signals, see section III. When combined with a pre-model for\nturbulent wind fluctuations, the stochastic approach models the power output of\nthe wind farm at a sampling frequency of 1Hz using only ten-minute average\nvalues of wind speed and directions. The stochastic signals generated are\ncompared to the measured signal, and show a good statistical agreement,\nincluding a proper reproduction of the intermittent, gusty features measured.\nIn parallel, a second application for performance monitoring is introduced in\nsection IV. The drift coefficient can be used as a sensitive measure of the\nglobal wind farm performance. When monitoring the wind farm as a whole, the\ndrift coefficient registers some significant deviation from normal operation if\none of twelve wind turbines is shut down during less than 4% of the time. Also,\nintermittent anomalies can be detected more rapidly than when using ten-minute\naveraging methods.

Qualitative comparisons using three-dimensional vorticity isosurfaces\nand lines, then quantitative comparisons using the helicity. To have a single\ninitial reconnection, as in the experiments, the trefoil is perturbed by 4 weak\nvortex rings. Initially there is a long period with deformations similar to the\nexperiment during which the energy, continuum helicity and topological\nself-linking number are all preserved. In the next period, once reconnection\nhas clearly begun, a Reynolds number independent fraction of the initial\nhelicity is dissipated in a finite time. In contrast, the experimental analysis\nfinds that the helicity inferred from the trajectories of hydrogen bubbles is\npreserved during reconnection. Since vortices reconnect gradually in a\nclassical fluid, it is suggested that the essential difference is in the\ninterpretation of the reconnection timescales associated with the observed\nevents. Both the time when reconnection begins, and when it ends. Supporting\nevidence for the strong numerical helicity depletion is provided by spectra, a\nprofile and visualisations of the helicity that show the formation of negative\nhelicity on the periphery of the trefoil. A single case with the same\ntrajectory and circulation, but a thinner core, replicates this helicity\ndepletion despite larger Sobolev norms, showing that the reconnection timescale\nis determined by the initial trajectory and circulation of the trefoil, not the\ninitial vorticity.

The proposed\nSCADA system has the following advantages: 1) simple (easier to be\nimplemented); 2) flexible (able to adapt to its environment dynamic changes);\nand 3) interoperable (relative to the underlying control systems, which belongs\nto diverse of vendors). The applicability of the proposed approach is\ndemonstrated by a real case study example carried out in a paper mill.\n","Comment: 16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1009.5346 by\n  other authors without attribution"]}]

However, for anyone less acquainted\nwith the work of industrial mathematicians, some clarification is desirable\nespecially for anyone who might be considering entering the field. This essay\ntherefore aims to shed light upon the nature of research being done at the\ninterface between mathematics and industry, paying particular attention to the\nfollowing questions: What is industrial mathematics? Where is industrial\nmathematics? How does one do industrial mathematics? Why (or more precisely,\nwhat value is there in doing) industrial mathematics?\n  I will attempt to answer these questions by means of several case studies\ndrawn from my own experience in tackling mathematical problems from industry.\n","Comment: in Beijing Intelligencer, ICIAM 2015 Congress, August 2015"]}]

The gauge theory description of the\nresulting 5d theory for a given 6d superconformal field theory is not unique,\nand we argue that the non-uniqueness leads to various dual 5d gauge theories.\nThere are three sources which lead to the 5d dualities. One type comes from\neither resolving both or one of the two $O7^-$-planes. The two situations give\nus two different ways to read off a 5d gauge theory from essentially the same\nweb diagram. The second type originates from different distributions of D5 or\nD7-branes, shifting the gauge group ranks of the 5d quiver theory. The last one\ncomes from the 90 or 45 degree rotations of the 5-brane web diagram, which is a\npart of the $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ duality of Type IIB string theory, leading to\ncompletely different group structure. These lead to a very rich class of\ndualities between 5d gauge theories whose UV completion is the same 6d\nsuperconformal field theory.

Decoupling the same flavors from the dual 5d theories\ngives rise to another dual 5d theories whose UV completion is the same 5d\nsuperconformal field theory.
