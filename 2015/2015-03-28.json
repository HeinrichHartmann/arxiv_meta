In this article, we describe the shape of\nDVW(F) and prove that there is a function from the components of DVW(F) to the\nisotopy classes of the generalized Heegaard splittings obtained by weak\nreductions from (V,W;F), where this function describes how the thick levels are\nembedded in the relevant compression bodies.\n","Comment: 22 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1402.4253"]}]
