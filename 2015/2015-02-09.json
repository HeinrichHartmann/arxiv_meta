They evolved independently from land plants and other\nmulticellular lineages, and therefore hold several original ontogenic and\nmetabolic features. Most brown algae grow along the coastal zone where they\nface frequent environmental changes, including exposure to toxic levels of\nheavy metals such as copper (Cu). We carried out large-scale transcriptomic and\nmetabolomic analyses to decipher the short-term acclimation of the brown algal\nmodel E. siliculosus to Cu stress, and compared these data to results known for\nother abiotic stressors. This comparison demonstrates that Cu induces oxidative\nstress in E. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic overlap between\nCu and H2O2 treatments. The common response to Cu and H2O2 consisted in the\nactivation of the oxylipin and the repression of inositol signaling pathways,\ntogether with the regulation of genes coding for several\ntranscription-associated proteins. Concomitantly, Cu stress specifically\nactivated a set of genes coding for orthologs of ABC transporters, a P1B-type\nATPase, ROS detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent\nbromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents. Finally\nwe observed, as a common abiotic stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic\nprocesses on one hand and the repression of genes involved in nitrogen\nassimilation on the other hand. Comparisons with data from green plants\nindicate that some processes involved in Cu and oxidative stress response are\nconserved across these two distant lineages. At the same time the high number\nof yet uncharacterized brown alga-specific genes induced in response to copper\nstress underlines the potential to discover new components and molecular\ninteractions unique to these organisms. Of particular interest for future\nresearch is the potential cross-talk between reactive oxygen species (ROS)-,\nmyo-inositol-, and oxylipin signaling.\n"]}]
