Gamma-ray lines from 56Co decay\nare expected to become directly visible through the overlying white dwarf\nmaterial several weeks after the explosion, as they progressively penetrate the\noverlying material of the supernova envelope, diluted as it expands. The lines\nare expected to be Doppler-shifted or broadened from the kinematics of the 56Ni\nejecta. With the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL and using an improved\ninstrumental background method, we detect the two main lines from 56Co decay at\n847 and 1238 keV from SN2014J at 3.3 Mpc, significantly Doppler-broadened, and\nat intensities (3.65+/-1.21) 10^-4 and (2.27+/-0.69) 10^-4 ph cm^-2s^-1,\nrespectively, at brightness maximum. We measure their rise towards a maximum\nafter about 60-100 days and decline thereafter. The intensity ratio of the two\nlines is found consistent with expectations from 56Co decay (0.62+/-0.28 at\nbrightness maximum, expected is 0.68). We find that the broad lines seen in the\nlate, gamma-ray transparent phase are not representative for the early\ngamma-ray emission, and rather notice the emission spectrum to be complex and\nirregular until the supernova is fully transparent to gamma-rays, with\nprogressive uncovering of the bulk of 56Ni. We infer that the explosion\nmorphology is not spherically symmetric, both in the distribution of 56Ni and\nof the unburnt material which occults the 56Co emission. Comparing light curves\nfrom different plausible models, the resulting 56Ni mass is determined as\n0.49+/-0.09 M_sol.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 6 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

At P\\'eclet numbers Pe >\n1 it behaves as a simple Herschel Bulkley liquid, whereas at Pe < 1 highly\nnon-monotonic flow curves are seen. In controlled stress testing it shows\nhysteresis and shear banding and in the usual type of stress scan, used to\nmeasure flow curves in controlled stress mode routinely, it can show very\nerratic and irreproducible behaviour. All of these features will be attributed\nhere to a dependence of the solid phase, or, yield stress, on the prevailing\nrate of shear at the yield point. Stress growth curves obtained from step\nstrain-rate testing showed that this rate-dependence was a consequence of\nP\\'eclet number dependent strain softening. At very low Pe, yield was\ncooperative and the yield strain was order-one, whereas as Pe approached unity,\nthe yield strain reduced to that needed to break interparticle bonds, causing\nthe yield stress to be greatly reduced.

Neutron radiography, on the other hand, provides a\nsolution for those cases, in particular for hydrogenous materials, owing to the\nlarge neutron scattering cross section of hydrogen and uncorrelated dependency\nof neutron cross section on the atomic number. The majority of neutron imaging\nexperiments at the present time is conducted with static objects mainly due to\nthe limited flux intensity of neutron beamline facilities and sometimes due to\nthe limitations of the detectors. However, some applications require the\nstudies of dynamic phenomena and can now be conducted at several high intensity\nbeamlines such as the recently rebuilt ANTARES beam line at the FRM-II reactor.\nIn this paper we demonstrate the capabilities of time resolved imaging for\nrepetitive processes, where different phases of the process can be imaged\nsimultaneously and integrated over multiple cycles. A fast MCP/Timepix neutron\ncounting detector was used to image the water distribution within a model steam\nengine operating at 10 Hz frequency. Within <10 minutes integration the amount\nof water was measured as a function of cycle time with a sub-mm spatial\nresolution, thereby demonstrating the capabilities of time-resolved neutron\nradiography for the future applications. The neutron spectrum of the ANTARES\nbeamline as well as transmission spectra of a Fe sample were also measured with\nthe Time Of Flight (TOF) technique in combination with a high resolution beam\nchopper. The energy resolution of our setup was found to be ~0.8% at 5 meV and\n~1.7% at 25 meV.\n"]}]

Due to the broadcast nature of radio\nwave propagation, the wireless transmission from the sensors to the sink can be\nreadily overheard by the eavesdropper for interception purposes. In an\ninformation-theoretic sense, the secrecy capacity of the wireless transmission\nis the difference between the channel capacity of the main link (from sensor to\nsink) and that of the wiretap link (from sensor to eavesdropper). If the\nsecrecy capacity becomes non-positive due to the wireless fading effect, the\nsensor's data transmission could be successfully intercepted by the\neavesdropper and an intercept event occurs in this case. However, in industrial\nenvironments, the presence of machinery obstacles, metallic frictions and\nengine vibrations makes the wireless fading fluctuate drastically, resulting in\nthe degradation of the secrecy capacity. As a consequence, an optimal sensor\nscheduling scheme is proposed in this paper to protect the legitimate wireless\ntransmission against the eavesdropping attack, where a sensor with the highest\nsecrecy capacity is scheduled to transmit its sensed information to the sink.\nClosed-form expressions of the probability of occurrence of an intercept event\n(called intercept probability) are derived for the conventional round-robin\nscheduling and the proposed optimal scheduling schemes.

For the two `constant' stars also observed by LAMOST,\nthe LAMOST Teff values are cooler than the KIC Teff by several hundred K, and\nwould move these stars out of the instability regions. It is possible that a\nmore accurate determination of their Teff and log g would move some of the\nother `constant' stars out of the instability regions.

In this way,\nour model can identify a Spatio-Temporal And-Or Graph (STAOG) to represent the\nlatent structure of actions e.g. triple jumping, swinging and high jumping.

A trion is a charged quasi-particle formed by adding one\nelectron or hole to a neutral exciton (a bound electron-hole pair).

Increasing the power of the\nexcitation laser beyond a certain threshold (~ 4 mW) allows modulation of\ntrion-to-exciton PL intensity ratio as well as the spectral linewidth of both\ntrions and excitons.

When $N=3$ we get a geodesic flow on the\ntwo-sphere minus three points. If, in addition we assume that the three masses\nare equal, then it was proved in [1] that the corresponding metric is\nhyperbolic: its Gaussian curvature is negative except at two points. Does the\nnegative curvature property persist for $N=4$, that is, in the equal mass\n$1/r^2$ 4-body problem? Here we prove `no' by computing that the corresponding\nRiemannian metric in this $N=4$ case has positive sectional curvature at some\ntwo-planes. This `no' answer dashes hopes of naively extending hyperbolicity\nfrom $N=3$ to $N>3$.\n","Comment: 10 pages, 1 figure"]}]

The models\nrange from three antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic chains to the full\nthree-dimensional situation. The situation with spin-1/2 is treated by\nexpansions around the Ising limit and exact diagonalization. Further,\nweak-coupling perturbation theory is used mainly for three coupled chains which\nare also investigated numerically using the density-matrix renormalization\ngroup technique. We find that already the three-chain model gives rise to the\nplateau-like feature at one third of the saturation magnetization which is\nobserved in magnetization experiments on CsCuCl_3 for a magnetic field\nperpendicular to the crystal axis. For a magnetic field parallel to the crystal\naxis, a jump is observed in the experimental magnetization curve in the region\nof again about one third of the saturation magnetization.
