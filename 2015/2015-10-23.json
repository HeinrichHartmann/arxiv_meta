With\nthis beam station, called PERC, the 'active decay volume' lies inside the\nneutron guide, and the charged neutron decay products are magnetically guided\ntowards the end of the neutron guide. Hence, the guide delivers at its exit a\nbeam of decay electrons and protons, under well-defined and precisely variable\nconditions, which can be well separated from the cold neutron beam. In this way\na general-purpose source of neutron decay products is obtained which can be\nused for various different experiments in neutron decay correlation\nspectroscopy. A gain in phase space density of several orders of magnitude can\nbe achieved with PERC, as compared to existing neutron decay spectrometers.\nNeutron beam related background is separately measurable in PERC, and magnetic\nmirror effects on the charged neutron decay products and edge effects in the\nactive neutron beam volume are both strongly suppressed. Therefore the spectra\nand angular distributions of the emerging decay particles will be\ndistortion-free on the level of 10^-4, more than 10 times better than achieved\ntoday.\n","Comment: 20 pages, 6 figures"]}]

The method is based on a key sociological insight\nthat has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years,\nbut has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that\nresource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective\nconsistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments\nabout identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient\naffective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental\nsentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent\nwith, and avoid and supress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent\nwith, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This \"affect control\nprinciple\" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In\nthis paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of\nthis principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively\nintelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain\nmultiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability\ndistribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make\nvalue-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively\nintelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity,\npredicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking\nactions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We\ndemonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our\nmodel can be used as an emotional \"plug-in\" for artificially intelligent\nsystems that interact with humans in two different settings: an exam practice\nassistant (tutor) and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive\ndisability.\n"]}]

In particular, the sampling and resampling procedures are novel in\nbeing expressed using kernel mean embeddings, so we theoretically analyze their\nbehaviors.

This compound exhibits intrinsic disorder resulting from random\nstacking of the FeSe layers along the $c$-axis that is not present in other\nintercalates of the same family. This arises because the coordination\nrequirements of the intercalated Sr and ammonia moieties imply that the\ninterlayer stacking (along $c$) involves a translation of either ${\\bf a}/2$ or\n${\\bf b}/2$ which locally breaks tetragonal symmetry. The result of this\nstacking arrangement is that the Fe ions in this compound describe a\nbody-centred tetragonal lattice in contrast to the primitive arrangement of Fe\nions described in all other Fe-based superconductors. In pulsed magnetic fields\nthe upper critical field $H_{\\text{c2}}$ was found to increase on cooling with\nan upwards curvature that is commonly seen in type-II superconductors of a\nmulti-band nature.

This flux corresponds to an apparent isotropic luminosity of\n(1.5$\\pm$0.2)$\\times$10$^{50}$ erg/s, comparable to the highest values observed\nby a blazar so far. During the flare the increase of flux was accompanied by a\nsignificant change of the spectral properties. Moreover significant flux\nvariations on a 6-h time-scale were observed, compatible with the light\ncrossing time of the event horizon of the central black hole. The broad band\nX-ray spectra of PKS 2149-306 observed by Swift-XRT and NuSTAR are well\ndescribed by a broken power-law model, with a very hard spectrum ($\\Gamma$$_1$\n$\\sim$ 1) below the break energy, at E$_{\\rm\\,break}$ = 2.5-3.0 keV, and\n$\\Gamma$$_2$ $\\sim$ 1.4-1.5 above the break energy. The steepening of the\nspectrum below $\\sim$ 3 keV may indicate that the soft X-ray emission is\nproduced by the low-energy relativistic electrons. This is in agreement with\nthe small variability amplitude and the lack of spectral changes in that part\nof the X-ray spectrum observed between the two NuSTAR and Swift joint\nobservations. As for the other high-redshift FSRQ detected by both Fermi-LAT\nand Swift-BAT, the photon index of PKS 2149-306 in hard X-ray is 1.6 or lower\nand the average gamma-ray luminosity higher than 2$\\times$10$^{48}$ erg/s.\n","Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables.

The term magnetoelectric potential is sometimes used to signify the\nmagnetic-monopole induced dual to the usual electromagnetic potential. To this\nend, we introduce a general theory for describing modes and characteristics of\nwaveguides based on mixed-monopole materials, with both electric and magnetic\nresponses. Our theory accommodates exotic media such as double-negative,\nnear-zero and zero-index materials, and we demonstrate that our general theory\nexhibits the electromagnetic duality that would arise if we were to incorporate\nmagnetic monopoles into the media. We consider linear, homogeneous, isotropic\nwaveguide materials with slab and cylindrical geometries. To ensure manifest\nelectromagnetic duality, we construct generic electromagnetic susceptibilities\nthat are dual in both electric charges and magnetic monopoles using a\ngeneralized Drude-Lorentz model that manifests this duality. Our model reduces\nto standard cases in appropriate limits. We consider metamaterials and\nmetamaterial waveguides, as well as metal guides, as examples of waveguides\nconstructed of mixed-monopole materials, to show the generality of our\nwaveguide theory. In particular, we show that, in slab and cylindrical\nwaveguides, exchanging electric and magnetic material properties leads to the\nexchange of transverse magnetic and transverse electric modes and dispersion\nequations, which suggests a good test of the potential duality of waveguides.\nThis theory has the capability to predict waveguide behavior under an exchange\nof electromagnetic parameters from the dual waveguide.\n","Comment: 11 pages, 7 figures.

A convenient way\nto develop GMI cuts is from MIR (mixed-integer rounding) cuts, which are\ndeveloped from 2-dimensional BMI (basic mixed integer) cuts, which involve a\nnonnegative continuous variable and an integer variable. The nonnegativity of\nthe continuous variable is not the right tool for us, as our starting point\n(the \"dual form\" mixed-integer optimization problem) has no nonnegativity. So\nwe work out a different 2-dimensional starting point, a pair of somewhat\narbitrary inequalities in one continuous and one integer variable. In the end,\nwe follow the approach of He and Lee, getting now a finitely converging\nprimal-simplex column-generation algorithm for mixed-integer optimization\nproblems.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1507.05358"]}]
