We then derive the conditional\ndistribution of the off-diagonal blocks, which is the cross-correlation of our\ninterest. We show that when there are two nodes, the conditional distribution\nhappens to be the inverted matrix variate $t$-distribution, from which we can\nreadily sample. For more than two nodes, the conditional distribution is no\nlonger the inverted matrix variate $t$-distribution. But we show that we can\ndecompose it into several sampling problems, each of which is the inverted\nmatrix variate $t$-distribution and therefore we can still sample from it.\nSince we can sample from this distribution, it enables us to use the Monte\nCarlo method to compute the minimum mean square error estimate for the fusion\nproblem. We use two models to generate experiment data and demonstrate the\ngenerality of our method. Simulation results show that the proposed method\nworks better than the popular covariance intersection method.\n"]}]

An isolated spin-1/2\nFM two-leg ladder is in the gapped saturated FM phase at zero temperature. As\nsoon as the spin-1/2 FM two-leg ladders are connected with antiferromagnetic\n(AFM) inter-ladder interaction, a first-order commensurate-incommensurate\nquantum phase transition occurs in the ground state magnetic phase diagram. In\nfact a jump in the magnetization curve is observed. We found that, coupled\nspin-1/2 FM two-leg ladders are in a nonmagnetic phase at zero temperature.\nApplying a magnetic field, the ground state of coupled spin-1/2 FM two-leg\nladders remains in the nonmagnetic phase up to a quantum saturate critical\nfield.\n"]}]

Plasmonic nanostructures\nhave been proposed to realize such super chiral fields for enhancing weak\nchiral signals. However, most of them cannot provide uniform chiral near-fields\nclose to the structures, which makes these nanostructures not so efficient for\napplications. Plasmonic helical nanostructures and blocked squares have been\nproved to provide uniform chiral near-fields, but structure fabrication is a\nchallenge. In this paper, we show that very simple plasmonic dimer structures\ncan provide uniform chiral fields in the gaps with large enhancement of both\nnear electric fields and chiral fields under linearly polarized light\nillumination with polarization off the dimer axis at dipole resonance. An\nanalytical dipole model is utilized to explain this behavior theoretically. 30\ntimes of volume averaged chiral field enhancement is gotten in the whole gap.\nChiral fields with opposite handedness can be obtained simply by changing the\npolarization to the other side of the dimer axis. It is especially useful in\nRaman optical activity measurement and chiral sensing of small quantity of\nchiral molecule.\n","Comment: 7 figures, 25 pages and supporting information (1 figure, 5 pages )"]}]

To facilitate this investigation we use the recently\ndeveloped MCMC based EoR analysis tool 21CMMC (Greig & Mesinger).

Using data from the 1991-1996 Law School Admission\nCouncil Bar Passage Study, students were reassigned attendance by simulation to\nlaw school tiers by transferring the affirmative action advantage for black\nstudents to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The hypothetical\nacademic outcomes for the students were then multiply-imputed to quantify the\nuncertainty of the resulting estimates. The analysis predicts dramatic\ndecreases in the numbers of black students in top law school tiers, suggesting\nthat class-based affirmative action is insufficient to maintain racial\ndiversity in prestigious law schools. Furthermore, there appear to be no\nstatistically significant changes in the graduation and bar passage rates of\nstudents in any demographic group. The results thus provide evidence that,\nother than increasing their representation in upper tiers, current affirmative\naction policies relative to a socioeconomic-based system neither substantially\nhelp nor harm minority academic outcomes, contradicting the predictions of the\n\"mismatch\" hypothesis, which asserts otherwise.\n","Comment: Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/15-STS514 in the Statistical\n  Science (http://www.imstat.org/sts/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)"]}]

Specifically, the phases of the QAM modulated data symbols\nare manipulated before transmission in order to make them more immune to the\nrandom rotational effects of phase noise. At the receiver, a two-stage detector\nis implemented, which first detects the amplitude of the transmitted symbols\nfrom a nonlinear combination of the received signal amplitudes.

In particular, the general growth law uniquely defines\ndistribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass\nsynthesis at each phase of growth and at each scale level. We exemplify the\napproach considering metabolic properties of growing human and dog livers and\nliver transplants. A procedure for verification of obtained results has been\nintroduced too. We found that two examined dogs have high metabolic rates\nconsuming about 0.62 and 1 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per\nday, and verified this using the proposed verification procedure.

This noticeable difference can be explained by\nevolutionary development, which required females to have greater liver\nprocessing capacity to support pregnancy.

We show that\nfor certain \"balanced\" support sets reconstruction with essentially the optimal\nnumber of measurements is possible. We prove recovery results for both perfect\nrecovery of the support set in case of exactly sparse vectors and an\n$\\ell_2$-norm approximation result for reconstruction under sparsity defect.Our\nanalysis complements earlier work by Strohmer & Friedlander and deepens the\nunderstanding of the considered MIMO radar model.\n","Comment: 31 pages"]}]

We begin by presenting constructions of gapped\nboundaries for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by using $d$-cocycles\nfunctions ($d\\geq 2$). We point out that the system supports $m$-dimensional\nexcitations ($m<d$), which we shall call fluctuating charges, that are\nsuperpositions of point-like electric charges characterized by $m$-dimensional\nbosonic SPT wavefunctions. There exist gapped boundaries where electric charges\nor magnetic fluxes may not condense by themselves, but may condense only when\naccompanied by fluctuating charges. Magnetic fluxes and codimension-$2$\nfluctuating charges exhibit non-trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics,\ninvolving more than two excitations. The statistical angle can be computed by\ntaking slant products of underlying cocycle functions sequentially. We find\nthat excitations that may condense into a gapped boundary can be characterized\nby trivial multi-excitation braiding statistics, generalizing the notion of the\nLagrangian subgroup. As an application, we construct fault-tolerantly\nimplementable logical gates for the $d$-dimensional quantum double model by\nusing $d$-cocycle functions. Namely, corresponding logical gates belong to the\n$d$th level of the Clifford hierarchy, but are outside of the $(d-1)$th level,\nif cocycle functions have non-trivial sequences of slant products.\n","Comment: 29 pages, 26 figures, single column"]}]
