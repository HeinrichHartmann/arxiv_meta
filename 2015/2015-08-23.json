We study two-armed bandit problems in continuous\ntime, where the risky arm can have two types: High or Low; both types yield\nstochastic payoffs generated by a Levy process. We show that the optimal\nstrategy is a cut-off strategy and we provide an explicit expression for the\ncut-off and for the optimal payoff.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0906.0835"]}]
