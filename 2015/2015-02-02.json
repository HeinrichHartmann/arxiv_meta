However, if the\ncosmological framework is extended to include also additional relativistic\ndegrees of freedom -- beyond the three standard neutrinos and the putative\nsterile neutrinos, then the hot dark matter constraint on the sterile states is\nconsiderably relaxed. A further improvement is achieved by allowing a dark\nenergy equation of state parameter w<-1. While BBN strongly disfavours extra\nradiation beyond the assumed eV-mass sterile neutrino, this constraint can be\ncircumvented by a small nu_e degeneracy. Any model containing eV-mass sterile\nneutrinos implies also strong modifications of other cosmological parameters.\nNotably, the inferred cold dark matter density can shift up by 20 to 75%\nrelative to the standard LambdaCDM value.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 6 figures, v2: minor changes, matches version accepted for\n  publication in JCAP"]}]

Physically, the\nimpossibility of measuring such a distribution experimentally, as a set of\nrelative frequencies, is due to the quantum back-action of projective\nmeasurements.

Here we present evidence for at least two\nseparate magma ocean outgassing episodes on Earth based on the ratio of\nprimordial 3He to 22Ne in the present-day mantle. We demonstrate that the\ndepleted mantle 3He/22Ne ratio is at least 10 while a more primitive mantle\nreservoir has a 3He/22Ne ratio of 2.3 to 3. The 3He/22Ne ratios of the mantle\nreservoirs are higher than possible sources of terrestrial volatiles, including\nthe solar nebula ratio of 1.5. Therefore, a planetary process must have raised\nthe mantle's 3He/22Ne ratio. We show that long-term plate tectonic cycling is\nincapable of raising the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio and may even lower it. However,\ningassing of a gravitationally accreted nebular atmosphere into a magma ocean\non the proto-Earth explains the 3He/22Ne and 20Ne/22Ne ratios of the primitive\nmantle reservoir. Increasing the mantle 3He/22Ne ratio to a value of 10 in the\ndepleted mantle requires at least two episodes of atmospheric blow-off and\nmagma ocean outgassing associated with giant impacts during subsequent\nterrestrial accretion. The preservation of a low 3He/22Ne ratio in a primitive\nreservoir sampled by plumes suggests that the later giant impacts, including\nthe Moon-forming giant impact, did not generate a whole mantle magma ocean.\nAtmospheric loss episodes associated with giant impacts provide an explanation\nfor Earth's subchondritic C/H, N/H, and Cl/F elemental ratios while preserving\nchondritic isotopic ratios.

This model belongs to the class of gradient type systems for which the\nfree energy can only decrease in time. It reveals a behavior typical for\nsubcritical bifurcations: below the mirror instability threshold, all localized\nstationary structures are unstable, while above threshold, the system displays\na blow-up behavior. It is shown that taking the electrons into account\n(non-zero temperature) does not change the structure of the asymptotic model.\nFor bi-Maxwellian distribution functions for both electrons and ions, the model\npredicts the formation of magnetic holes. The second part contains original\nresults concerning two-dimensional steady mirror structures which can form in\nthe saturated regime. Based on Grad-Shafranov-like equations, a gyrotropic\nplasma, where the pressures in the static regime are only functions of the\namplitude of the local magnetic field, is shown to be amenable to a variational\nprinciple with a free energy density given by the parallel tension. This\napproach is used to demonstrate that small-amplitude static holes constructed\nslightly below the mirror instability threshold identify with lump solitons of\nKPII equation and turn out to be unstable. It is also shown that regularizing\neffects such as finite Larmor radius corrections cannot be ignored in the\ndescription of large-amplitude mirror structures.
