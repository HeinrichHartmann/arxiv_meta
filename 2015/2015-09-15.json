In this work, we aim to highlight potential benefits of\nsuch asynchrony phenomena to tasks involving symmetry breaking. Specifically,\nin this paper, identical (except for their speeds) mobile agents are placed at\narbitrary locations on a cycle of length $n$ and use their speed difference in\norder to rendezvous fast. We normalize the speed of the slower agent to be 1,\nand fix the speed of the faster agent to be some $c>1$. (An agent does not know\nwhether it is the slower agent or the faster one.) The straightforward\ndistributed-race DR algorithm is the one in which both agents simply start\nwalking until rendezvous is achieved. It is easy to show that, in the worst\ncase, the rendezvous time of DR is $n/(c-1)$. Note that in the interesting\ncase, where $c$ is very close to 1 this bound becomes huge. Our first result is\na lower bound showing that, up to a multiplicative factor of 2, this bound is\nunavoidable, even in a model that allows agents to leave arbitrary marks, even\nassuming sense of direction, and even assuming $n$ and $c$ are known to agents.\nThat is, we show that under such assumptions, the rendezvous time of any\nalgorithm is at least $\\frac{n}{2(c-1)}$ if $c\\leq 3$ and slightly larger if\n$c>3$. We then construct an algorithm that precisely matches the lower bound\nfor the case $c\\leq 2$, and almost matches it when $c>2$. Moreover, our\nalgorithm performs under weaker assumptions than those stated above, as it does\nnot assume sense of direction, and it allows agents to leave only a single mark\n(a pebble) and only at the place where they start the execution. Finally, we\ninvestigate the setting in which no marks can be used at all, and show tight\nbounds for $c\\leq 2$, and almost tight bounds for $c>2$.\n"]}]

In this way, classifiers trained on the sparse codes in the source\ndomain consisting of frontal faces for example can be applied to the target\ndomain (consisting of faces in different poses, illumination conditions, etc)\nwithout much loss in recognition accuracy. The approach is to first learn a\ndomain base dictionary, and then describe each domain shift (identity, pose,\nillumination) using a sparse representation over the base dictionary. The\ndictionary adapted to each domain is expressed as sparse linear combinations of\nthe base dictionary. In the context of face recognition, with the proposed\ncompositional dictionary approach, a face image can be decomposed into sparse\nrepresentations for a given subject, pose and illumination respectively. This\napproach has three advantages: first, the extracted sparse representation for a\nsubject is consistent across domains and enables pose and illumination\ninsensitive face recognition. Second, sparse representations for pose and\nillumination can subsequently be used to estimate the pose and illumination\ncondition of a face image. Finally, by composing sparse representations for\nsubject and the different domains, we can also perform pose alignment and\nillumination normalization.

By\nconsidering the negligible thickness of the membrane, usually on the order of a\nfraction of one millimeter, we derive a relation showing that the sum of the\nincoming sound waves' (complex) pressure amplitudes, averaged over the area of\nthe membrane, must be equal to that of the outgoing waves. By using this\nrelation, and without going to any details of the wave solutions, it is shown\nthat the maximum absorption achievable from one-side incident is 50%, while the\nmaximum absorption with a back reflecting surface can reach 100%. The latter\nwas attained by the hybridized resonances. All the results are shown to be in\nexcellent agreement with the experiments.

The basic model\nstudied here is that of a two-level system (TLS), whose energy is periodically\nmodulated while the system is coupled to thermal baths. When the modulation\ninterval is short compared to the bath memory time, the system-bath\ncorrelations are affected, thereby causing cooling or heating of the TLS,\ndepending on the interval. In steady state, a periodically-modulated TLS\ncoupled to two distinct baths constitutes the simplest quantum heat machine\n(QHM) that may operate as either an engine or a refrigerator, depending on the\nmodulation rate. We find their efficiency and power-output bounds and the\nconditions for attaining these bounds. An extension of this model to multilevel\nsystems shows that the QHM power output can be boosted by the multilevel\ndegeneracy.\n  These results are used to scrutinize basic thermodynamic principles: (i)\nExternally-driven/modulated QHMs may attain the Carnot efficiency bound, but\nwhen the driving is done by a quantum device (\"piston\"), the efficiency\nstrongly depends on its initial quantum state. Such dependence has been unknown\nthus far. (ii) The refrigeration rate effected by QHMs does not vanish as the\ntemperature approaches absolute zero for certain quantized baths, e.g.,\nmagnons, thous challenging Nernst's unattainability principle. (iii)\nSystem-bath correlations allow more work extraction under periodic control than\nthat expected from the Szilard-Landauer principle, provided the period is in\nthe non-Markovian domain.

However,\nmost existing studies do not address the \"free rider\" issue, that is, nodes far\naway from query nodes and irrelevant to them are included in the detected\ncommunity. Some state-of-the-art models have attempted to address this issue,\nbut not only are their formulated problems NP-hard, they do not admit any\napproximations without restrictive assumptions, which may not always hold in\npractice.\n  In this paper, given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q, we\nstudy community search using the k-truss based community model. We formulate\nour problem of finding a closest truss community (CTC), as finding a connected\nk-truss subgraph with the largest k that contains Q, and has the minimum\ndiameter among such subgraphs. We prove this problem is NP-hard. Furthermore,\nit is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $(2-\\varepsilon)$, for\nany $\\varepsilon >0 $. However, we develop a greedy algorithmic framework,\nwhich first finds a CTC containing Q, and then iteratively removes the furthest\nnodes from Q, from the graph. The method achieves 2-approximation to the\noptimal solution. To further improve the efficiency, we make use of a compact\ntruss index and develop efficient algorithms for k-truss identification and\nmaintenance as nodes get eliminated. In addition, using bulk deletion\noptimization and local exploration strategies, we propose two more efficient\nalgorithms. One of them trades some approximation quality for efficiency while\nthe other is a very efficient heuristic.

The appropriate choice for a\nparticular access can reduce the average memory latency. However, since\napplication access patterns change at run time, static page policies cannot\nguarantee to deliver optimum execution time. Hybrid page policies have been\ninvestigated as a means of covering these dynamic scenarios and are now\nimplemented in state-of-the-art processors. Hybrid page policies switch between\nopen-page and close-page policies while the application is running, by\nmonitoring the access pattern of row hits/conflicts and predicting future\nbehavior. Unfortunately, as the size of DRAM memory increases, fine-grain\ntracking and analysis of memory access patterns does not remain practical. We\npropose a compact memory address-based encoding technique which can improve or\nmaintain the performance of DRAMs page closure predictors while reducing the\nhardware overhead in comparison with state-of-the-art techniques. As a case\nstudy, we integrate our technique, HAPPY, with a state-of-the-art monitor, the\nIntel-adaptive open-page policy predictor employed by the Intel Xeon X5650, and\na traditional Hybrid page policy. We evaluate them across 70 memory intensive\nworkload mixes consisting of single-thread and multi-thread applications.

In the\nproposed approach, the $M$ input integer data streams are linearly superimposed\nto form $M$ numerically entangled integer data streams that are stored in-place\nof the original inputs. A series of LSB operations can then be performed\ndirectly using these entangled data streams. The output results can be\nextracted from any $M-1$ entangled output streams by additions and arithmetic\nshifts, thereby guaranteeing robustness to a fail-stop failure in any single\nstream computation. Importantly, unlike other methods, the number of operations\nrequired for the entanglement, extraction and recovery of the results is\nlinearly related to the number of the inputs and does not depend on the\ncomplexity of the performed LSB operations.

We apply a likelihood analysis optimized\nfor the spectral and morphological features expected in the dark matter decay\nsignals. This is the first time that a dedicated Dark Matter optimization is\napplied in a MAGIC analysis, taking into account the inferred Dark Matter\ndistribution of the source. The results with the full dataset analysis will be\npublished soon by the MAGIC Collaboration.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 2 Figure, to appear in Proc. of the 34th International\n  Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC2015), The Hague (Netherlands), July 30-August 6\n  2015"]}]

ESAs dosing is currently based on clinical protocols that often do not\naccount for the high inter- and intra-individual variability in the patient's\nresponse.

Computing\noptimal drug administration strategies for chronic diseases is a sequential\ndecision-making problem in which the goal is to find the best sequence of drug\ndoses. MDPs are particularly suitable for modeling these problems due to their\nability to capture the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the treatment\nand the stochastic nature of the underlying process. The RL algorithm employed\nin the proposed methodology is fitted Q iteration, which stands out for its\nability to make an efficient use of data.\n  Results: The experiments reported here are based on a computational model\nthat describes the effect of ESAs on the hemoglobin level. The performance of\nthe proposed method is evaluated and compared with the well-known Q-learning\nalgorithm and with a standard protocol.
