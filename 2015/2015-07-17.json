In U.S. law, unintentional\nbias is encoded via disparate impact, which occurs when a selection process has\nwidely different outcomes for different groups, even as it appears to be\nneutral. This legal determination hinges on a definition of a protected class\n(ethnicity, gender, religious practice) and an explicit description of the\nprocess.\n  When the process is implemented using computers, determining disparate impact\n(and hence bias) is harder. It might not be possible to disclose the process.\nIn addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a\nlegal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring\naccess to the algorithm, we propose making inferences based on the data the\nalgorithm uses.\n  We make four contributions to this problem. First, we link the legal notion\nof disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known,\nhas received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for\ndisparate impact based on analyzing the information leakage of the protected\nclass from the other data attributes.

One of the\npathways to their formation includes direct collapse of gas, forming a\nsupermassive star, precursor of the black hole seed. The conditions for direct\ncollapse are more easily achievable in metal-free haloes, where atomic hydrogen\ncooling operates and molecular hydrogen (H2) formation is inhibited by a strong\nexternal UV flux. Above a certain value of UV flux (J_crit), the gas in a halo\ncollapses isothermally at ~$10^4$ K and provides the conditions for\nsupermassive star formation. However, H2 can self-shield, reducing the effect\nof photodissociation. So far, most numerical studies used the local Jeans\nlength to calculate the column densities for self-shielding. We implement an\nimproved method for the determination of column densities in 3D simulations and\nanalyse its effect on the value of J_crit. This new method captures the gas\ngeometry and velocity field and enables us to properly determine the\ndirection-dependent self-shielding factor of H2 against photodissociating\nradiation. We find a value of J_crit that is a factor of two smaller than with\nthe Jeans approach (~2000 J_21 vs. ~4000 J_21). The main reason for this\ndifference is the strong directional dependence of the H2 column density. With\nthis lower value of J_crit, the number of haloes exposed to a flux >J_crit is\nlarger by more than an order of magnitude compared to previous studies.

We address this\nlongstanding question from a computational perspective, focusing on the case of\nsound change. Sound change arises from the pronunciation variability ubiquitous\nin every speech community, but most such variability does not lead to change.\nHence, an adequate model must allow for stability as well as change. Existing\ntheories of sound change tend to emphasize factors at the level of individual\nlearners promoting one outcome or the other, such as channel bias (which favors\nchange) or inductive bias (which favors stability). Here, we consider how the\ninteraction of these biases can lead to both stability and change in a\npopulation setting. We find that population structure itself can act as a\nsource of stability, but that both stability and change are possible only when\nboth types of bias are active, suggesting that it is possible to understand why\nsound change occurs at some times and not others as the population-level result\nof the interplay between forces promoting each outcome in individual speakers.\nIn addition, if it is assumed that learners learn from two or more teachers,\nthe transition from stability to change is marked by a phase transition,\nconsistent with the abrupt transitions seen in many empirical cases of sound\nchange.

The increase of band\nelectrons produced by Pd/Ag substitution depresses T_C(x) from 4.1K down to\nT_C(x=0.5)=1.1K, with a QCP extrapolated to x_{QCP}~ 0.6. Magnetic\nsusceptibility from T>30K indicates an effective moment slightly decreasing\nfrom \\mu_{eff}=2.56\\mu_B to 2.4\\mu_B at x=0.5. These values and the\nparamagnetic temperature \\theta_P~ -10K exclude significant Kondo screening\neffects. The T_C(x) reduction is accompanied by a weakening of the FM\nmagnetization and the emergence of a specific heat C_m(T) anomaly at T*~ 1K,\nwithout signs of magnetism detected from AC-susceptibility. The magnetic\nentropy collected around 4K (i.e. the T_C of the x=0 sample) practically does\nnot change with Ag concentration: S_m(4K)~ 0.8 Rln2, suggesting a progressive\ntransfer of FM degrees of freedom to the non-magnetic (NM) component. No\nantecedent was found concerning any NM anomaly emerging from a FM system at\nsuch temperature. The origin of this anomaly is attributed to an 'entropy\nbottleneck' originated in the nearly divergent power law dependence for T>T*.\n","Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, Int. Conf. ICM 2015"]}]
