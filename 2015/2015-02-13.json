Each service\nprovider chooses between a variety of levels of service (latencies, for ISPs),\nand as long as it does not lose customers, aims at minimizing its level of\nservice; the minimum level of service required to satisfy a customer varies\nacross customers.

In\nthis paper, we present a computationally efficient method to recover dense\ndepth maps from sparse measurements. We make three contributions. First, we\nprovide empirical evidence that depth maps can be encoded much more sparsely\nthan natural images by using common dictionaries such as wavelets and\ncontourlets. We also show that a combined wavelet-contourlet dictionary\nachieves better performance than using either dictionary alone. Second, we\npropose an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to achieve fast\nreconstruction. A multi-scale warm start procedure is proposed to speed up the\nconvergence. Third, we propose a two-stage randomized sampling scheme to\noptimally choose the sampling locations, thus maximizing the reconstruction\nperformance for any given sampling budget.

Assuming a reactive interference-limited\nscenario, each transmitter is allowed to select one frequency channel (from a\ncommon pool) together with a power level at each transmission trial; hence, for\nall transmitters, not only the fading gain, but also the number of interfering\ntransmissions and their transmit powers are varying over time. Due to the\nabsence of a central controller and time-varying network characteristics, it is\nhighly inefficient for transmitters to acquire global channel and network\nknowledge. Therefore a reasonable assumption is that transmitters have no\nknowledge of fading gains, interference, and network topology. Each\ntransmitting node selfishly aims at maximizing its average reward (or\nminimizing its average cost), which is a function of the action of that\nspecific transmitter as well as those of all other transmitters. This scenario\nis modeled as a multi-player multi-armed adversarial bandit game, in which\nmultiple players receive an a priori unknown reward with an arbitrarily\ntime-varying distribution by sequentially pulling an arm, selected from a known\nand finite set of arms. Since players do not know the arm with the highest\naverage reward in advance, they attempt to minimize their so-called regret,\ndetermined by the set of players' actions, while attempting to achieve\nequilibrium in some sense. To this end, we design in this paper two joint power\nlevel and channel selection strategies. We prove that the gap between the\naverage reward achieved by our approaches and that based on the best fixed\nstrategy converges to zero asymptotically. Moreover, the empirical joint\nfrequencies of the game converge to the set of correlated equilibria. We\nfurther characterize this set for two special cases of our designed game.\n"]}]

The problem space that this project is\nspecifically concerned with deals with the reduction of cost and the use of\nopen platforms to make solar monitoring viable in developing countries where\nboth the resources and general knowledge required to undertake such efforts are\nparticularly scarce.\n  Currently, solar monitoring technologies are expensive, limited in their\napplication, and for the most part proprietary. It is arguable that such\nsystems can be developed using non-customized hardware and open-source software\nthat can be obtained and run anywhere in the world. This project is one such\nargument. This proof of concept is sufficient to show that solar remote\nmonitoring is neither expensive nor particularly cumbersome to implement and\nthus warrants further investigation and development by the open source\ncommunity.\n","Comment: 19"]}]
