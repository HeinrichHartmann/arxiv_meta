First, it is\nproved that the class of two-turn quantum Arthur-Merlin games with quantum\npublic coins, denoted qq-QAM in this paper, does not change by adding a\nconstant number of turns of classical interactions prior to the communications\nof the qq-QAM proof systems.

Answering such\nquestions is difficult because the number of genotypes can be\nhyper-astronomically large. By solving the genotype-phenotype (GP) map for RNA\nsecondary structure for systems up to length $L=126$ nucleotides (where the set\nof all possible RNA strands would weigh more than the mass of the visible\nuniverse) we show that the GP map strongly constrains the evolution of\nnon-coding RNA (ncRNA).

We demonstrate\nthat an additional subleading $O(1)$ contribution generically arises for all\nR\\'enyi entropies $S^{(n)}$ with $n \\geq 2$ when driving the system towards a\nphase transition, e.g. into a conventionally ordered phase.

The class generalizes various examples of modified\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequalities considered previously in the literature.\nRefining a method of Aida and Stroock for the classical logarithmic Sobolev\ninequality, we prove that if a measure on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies a modified\nlogarithmic Sobolev inequality then it satisfies a family of $L^p$-Sobolev-type\ninequalities with non-Euclidean norms of gradients (and dimension-independent\nconstants). The latter are shown to yield various concentration-type estimates\nfor deviations of smooth (not necessarily Lipschitz) functions and measures of\nenlargements of sets corresponding to non-Euclidean norms. We also prove a\ntwo-level concentration result for functions of bounded Hessian and measures\nsatisfying the classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality.\n"]}]

In robotic applications soft materials can store and release\nenergy, absorb impacts, increase compliance and increase the range of possible\nshape profiles using minimal actuators. The shape changing ability is also a\npotential tool to manipulate friction forces caused by contact with the\nenvironment. These advantages are accompanied by challenges of soft material\nactuation and the need to exploit frictional interactions to generate\nlocomotion. Accordingly, the design of soft robots involves exploitation of\ncontinuum properties of soft materials for manipulating frictional interactions\nthat result in robot locomotion. The research presents design and control of a\nsoft body robot that uses its shape change capability for locomotion. The\nbioinspired (caterpillar) modular robot design is a soft monolithic body which\ninteracts with the environment at discrete contact points (caterpillar\nprolegs). The deformable body is actuated by muscle-like shape memory alloy\ncoils and the discrete contact points manipulate friction in a binary manner.\nThis novel virtual grip mechanism combines two materials with different\ncoefficients of frictions (sticky-slippery) to control the robot-environment\nfriction interactions. The research also introduces a novel control concept\nthat discretizes the robot-environment-friction interaction into binary states.\nThis facilitates formulation of a control framework that is independent of the\nspecific actuator or soft material properties and can be applied to\nmulti-limbed soft robots. The transitions between individual robot states are\nassigned a reward that allow optimized state transition control sequences to be\ncalculated. This conceptual framework is extremely versatile and we show how it\ncan be applied to situations in which the robot loses limb function.\n"]}]

Bag-of-words (BoW) methods\nconstitute a popular approach to map retrieval; however, these methods have\nextremely limited descriptive ability because they ignore the spatial layout\ninformation of the local features. The main contribution of this paper is an\nextension of the bag-of-words map retrieval method to enable the use of spatial\ninformation from local features. Our strategy is to explicitly model a unique\nviewpoint of an input local map; the pose of the local feature is defined with\nrespect to this unique viewpoint, and can be viewed as an additional invariant\nfeature for discriminative map retrieval. Specifically, we wish to determine a\nunique viewpoint that is invariant to moving objects, clutter, occlusions, and\nactual viewpoints. Hence, we perform scene parsing to analyze the scene\nstructure, and consider the \"center\" of the scene structure to be the unique\nviewpoint. Our scene parsing is based on a Manhattan world grammar that imposes\na quasi-Manhattan world constraint to enable the robust detection of a scene\nstructure that is invariant to clutter and moving objects.

In an iterative compaction algorithm, we insist that the graphs\ndecrease by a constant fraction of the entire graph.\n  Another approach to solving optimization problems is to exploit the\nstructural properties implied by the connectivity of the input graph.

Early\nalgorithms on mining communities have focused on the global structure, and\noften run in time functional to the size of the entire graph. Nowadays, as we\noften explore networks with billions of vertices and find communities of size\nhundreds, it is crucial to shift our attention from macroscopic structure to\nmicroscopic structure when dealing with large networks. A growing body of work\nhas been adopting local expansion methods in order to identify the community\nfrom a few exemplary seed members.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for finding overlapping\ncommunities called LEMON (Local Expansion via Minimum One Norm). Different from\nPageRank-like diffusion methods, LEMON finds the community by seeking a sparse\nvector in the span of the local spectra such that the seeds are in its support.\nWe show that LEMON can achieve the highest detection accuracy among\nstate-of-the-art proposals. The running time depends on the size of the\ncommunity rather than that of the entire graph. The algorithm is easy to\nimplement, and is highly parallelizable.\n  Moreover, given that networks are not all similar in nature, a comprehensive\nanalysis on how the local expansion approach is suited for uncovering\ncommunities in different networks is still lacking. We thoroughly evaluate our\napproach using both synthetic and real-world datasets across different domains,\nand analyze the empirical variations when applying our method to inherently\ndifferent networks in practice. In addition, the heuristics on how the quality\nand quantity of the seed set would affect the performance are provided.\n","Comment: 10pages, published in WWW2015 proceedings"]}]
