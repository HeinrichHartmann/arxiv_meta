The\nenergy efficiency of DSS is strongly influenced not only by the volume of data,\nfrequency of data access and redundancy in data storage, but also by the\nheterogeneity exhibited by the DSS in these dimensions. To this end, we propose\nand analyze the energy efficiency of a heterogeneous distributed storage system\nin which $n$ storage servers (disks) store the data of $R$ distinct classes.\nData of class $i$ is encoded using a $(n,k_{i})$ erasure code and the (random)\ndata retrieval requests can also vary across classes. We show that the energy\nefficiency of such systems is closely related to the average latency and hence\nmotivates us to study the energy efficiency via the lens of average latency.\nThrough this connection, we show that erasure coding serves the dual purpose of\nreducing latency and increasing energy efficiency. We present a queuing\ntheoretic analysis of the proposed model and establish upper and lower bounds\non the average latency for each data class under various scheduling policies.\nThrough extensive simulations, we present qualitative insights which reveal the\nimpact of coding rate, number of servers, service distribution and number of\nredundant requests on the average latency and energy efficiency of the DSS.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing.

It uses a multigene variant of the biologically inspired\nmachine learning method of genetic programming (MGGP) as the engine that drives\nthe automatic model discovery process. Symbolic data mining is the process of\nextracting hidden, meaningful relationships from data in the form of symbolic\nequations. In contrast to other data-mining methods, the structural\ntransparency of the generated predictive equations can give new insights into\nthe physical systems or processes that generated the data. Furthermore, this\ntransparency makes the models very easy to deploy outside of MATLAB. The\nrationale behind GPTIPS is to reduce the technical barriers to using,\nunderstanding, visualising and deploying GP based symbolic models of data,\nwhilst at the same time remaining highly customisable and delivering robust\nnumerical performance for power users. In this chapter, notable new features of\nthe latest version of the software are discussed with these aims in mind.\nAdditionally, a simplified variant of the MGGP high level gene crossover\nmechanism is proposed. It is demonstrated that the new functionality of GPTIPS\n2 (a) facilitates the discovery of compact symbolic relationships from data\nusing multiple approaches, e.g. using novel gene-centric visualisation analysis\nto mitigate horizontal bloat and reduce complexity in multigene symbolic\nregression models (b) provides numerous methods for visualising the properties\nof symbolic models (c) emphasises the generation of graphically navigable\nlibraries of models that are optimal in terms of the Pareto trade off surface\nof model performance and complexity and (d) expedites real world applications\nby the simple, rapid and robust deployment of symbolic models outside the\nsoftware environment they were developed in.\n","Comment: 26 pages, accepted for publication in the Springer Handbook of\n  Genetic Programming Applications (2015, in press)"]}]

We find that the Milky Way\ncontribution has previously been underestimated by a factor of ~2, and that the\nforeground-subtracted DMs are consistent with a cosmological origin,\ncorresponding to a source population observable to a maximum redshift\nz~0.6-0.9. We consider models for the spatial distribution of FRBs in which\nthey are randomly distributed in the Universe, track the star-formation rate of\ntheir host galaxies, track total stellar mass, or require a central\nsupermassive black hole. Current data do not discriminate between these\npossibilities, but the predicted DM distributions for different models will\ndiffer considerably once we begin detecting FRBs at higher DMs and higher\nredshifts. We additionally consider the distribution of FRB fluences, and show\nthat the observations are consistent with FRBs being standard candles, each\nburst producing the same radiated isotropic energy. The data imply a constant\nisotropic burst energy of ~7e40 erg if FRBs are embedded in host galaxies, or\n~9e40 erg if FRBs are randomly distributed. These energies are 10-100 times\nlarger than had previously been inferred.

Following a recent work [Phys.\nLett. B 713 (2012) 304], we show that it is possible to construct in the\ncontext of travelling wave solutions a configurational entropy measure in\nfunctional space, from the field configurations. Thus, we investigate the\nexistence and properties of travelling solitons in Lorentz and CPT breaking\nscenarios for a class of models with two interacting scalar fields. Here, we\nobtain a complete set of exact solutions for the model studied which display\nboth double and single-kink configurations. In fact, such models are very\nimportant in applications that include Bloch branes, Skyrmions, Yang-Mills,\nQ-balls, oscillons and various superstring-motivated theories. We find that the\nso-called Configurational Entropy (CE) for travelling solitons, which we name\nas travelling Configurational Entropy (TCE), shows that the best value of\nparameter responsible to break the Lorentz symmetry is one where the energy\ndensity is distributed equally around the origin. In this way, the\ninformation-theoretical measure of travelling solitons in Lorentz symmetry\nviolation scenarios opens a new window to probe situations where the parameters\nresponsible for breaking the symmetries are random. In this case, the TCE\nselects the best value.\n"]}]

This result appears to be\ninconsistent with the recent reports that low-luminosity AGNs show essentially\nno correlation between FIR and X-ray luminosities, while the discrepancy is\nlikely due to the Malmquist and sample selection biases. By analyzing the\nspectral energy distribution, we find that pure-AGN candidates, of which FIR\nradiation is thought to be AGN-dominated, show significantly low-SF activities.\nThese AGNs hosted by low-SF galaxies are rare in our sample (~ 1%). However,\nthe low fraction of low-SF AGN is possibly due to observational limitations\nsince the recent FIR surveys are insufficient to examine the population of\nhigh-luminosity AGNs hosted by low-SF galaxies.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 13 pages, 9 figures"]}]

On one\nhand, in the centralized scenario, where local samples are precisely\ntransmitted to the fusion center, the generalized sequential likelihood ratio\ntest (GSPRT) is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of the expected\nsample size as error rates tend to zero.

To this end, we first\nconsider a decentralized scheme where sensors send their one-bit quantized\nstatistics every fixed period of time to the fusion center. We show that such a\nuniform sampling and quantization scheme is strictly suboptimal and its\nsuboptimality can be quantified by the KL divergence of the distributions of\nthe quantized statistics under both hypotheses.

Moreover, the EM distribution of kT ~\n0.30 keV plasma is highly asymmetric in the northern and southern bubbles.\nAlthough the association of the X-ray emission with the bubbles is not\nconclusive, we compare the observed EM properties with simple models assuming\n(i) a filled halo without bubbles, whose gas density follows a hydrostatic\nisothermal model (King profile) and (ii) a bubble-in-halo in which two\nidentical bubbles expand into the halo forming thick shells of swept halo gas.\nWe argue that the EM profile in the north (b > 0 deg) favors (ii), whereas that\nof the south (b < 0 deg) is rather close to (i), but weak excess signature is\nclearly detected also in the south like NPS (South Polar Spur; SPS). Such an\nasymmetry, if due to the bubbles, cannot be fully understood only by the\ninclination of bubbles' axis against the Galactic disk normal, thus suggesting\nasymmetric outflow due to different environmental/initial condition.\n","Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures - accepted by Astrophysical Journal"]}]

In this paper we present a test of\nthe scaling relation for the global asteroseismic parameter $\\nu_{\\rm max}$,\nthe frequency at which a solar-like oscillator presents its strongest observed\npulsation amplitude. The classic relation assumes that this characteristic\nfrequency scales with a particular combination of surface gravity and effective\ntemperature that also describes the dependence of the cut-off frequency for\nacoustic waves in an isothermal atmosphere, i.e., $\\nu_{\\rm max} \\propto\ngT_{\\rm eff}^{-1/2}$. We test how well the oscillations of cool main-sequence\nand sub-giant stars adhere to this relation, using a sample of asteroseismic\ntargets observed by the NASA \\emph{Kepler} Mission.

In the first\nof these ranges, we validate previous work, which resulted in a simple\nmass-compensation design for the monopole scatterer, while in the second and\nthird ranges, a combination of the use of an appropriate coating and the\nappropriate choice of the amplitudes of the active cloaking sources is\nnecessary. We show that such cloaking can indeed be effective in the region of\nstrong scattering resonances. We give closed form analytic expressions for the\nrequired amplitudes of the active cloaking sources in the three frequency\nregions and provide asymptotic estimates and numerical illustrations.\n","Comment: 26 pages, 20 figures, 2 tables"]}]

We predict this possibility in\nan analytical form, and test it in direct simulations. Systematic simulations\nreveal several generic dynamical regimes, depending on the amplitude and\nfrequency of the time modulation, and on initial thrust which sets the soliton\nin motion. These regimes include irregular motion, regular motion of a decaying\nsoliton, and regular motion of a stable one. The motion may occur in both the\nstraight and reverse directions, relative to the initial thrust. In the case of\nstable motion, extremely long simulations in a lattice with periodic boundary\nconditions demonstrate that the soliton keeps moving as long as we can monitor\nwithout any visible loss. Velocities of moving stable solitons are in good\nagreement with the analytical prediction, which is based on requiring a\nresonance between the ac drive and motion of the soliton through the periodic\npotential. All the generic dynamical regimes are mapped in the model's\nparameter space. Collisions between moving stable solitons are briefly\ninvestigated too, with a conclusion that two different outcomes are possible:\nelastic bounce, or bounce with mass transfer from one soliton to the other.
