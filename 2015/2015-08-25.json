Item nonresponse is usually dealt with by\nimputation. By noting that for a particular survey variable, we just have\nobserved and unobserved values, in this work we exploit the connection between\nunit and item nonresponse. In particular, we assume that the factors that drive\nunit response are the same as those that drive item response on selected\nvariables of interest.

A free use of auxiliary unary constraints given besides\ninput instances has proven to be useful in establishing a complete\nclassification of the computational complexity of approximately solving\nweighted counting Boolean constraint satisfaction problems (or #CSPs). In\nparticular, two special constant unary constraints are a key to an arity\nreduction of arbitrary constraints, sufficient for the desired classification.\nIn an exact counting model, both constant unary constraints are always assumed\nto be available since they can be eliminated efficiently using an arbitrary\nnonempty set of constraints. In contrast, we demonstrate in an approximate\ncounting model, that at least one of them is efficiently approximated and thus\neliminated approximately by a nonempty constraint set. This fact directly leads\nto an efficient construction of polynomial-time randomized\napproximation-preserving Turing reductions (or AP-reductions) from #CSPs with\ndesignated constraints to any given #CSPs composed of symmetric real-valued\nconstraints of arbitrary arities even in the presence of arbitrary extra unary\nconstraints.\n","Comment: 10pt, A4, 21 pages.

The system manifests the phenomenon known as\n\"critical slowing down\", as the relaxation time diverges when <q> tends to\n<q>_c. At the threshold, the dynamics become critical characterized by a\npower-law relaxation (1/t^2). Below the threshold, a long-lasting transient\nprocess (a \"plateau\" stage) occurs. This transient process ends with a collapse\nin which the entire network disappears completely. The duration of the process\ndiverges when <q> tends to <q>_c.

It is shown that these models\ndescribe different non-overlapping plasma regimes. The RPA describes a weakly\ncoupled plasma whose dynamics are an admixture of independent particle modes at\nshort wavelengths and collective plasma modes at long wavelengths. The SPPA\ndescribes a system dominated by collective resonances at all wavelengths. A new\nmodel of a multicomponent plasma, the Generalized Plasmon Pole Approximation\n(GPPA), is formulated and shown to provide a description of a range of plasma\nregimes encompassing both those described by the RPA and the SPPA. Therefore,\nas well as providing a good representation of the RPA, in both quantum and\nclassical, regimes, this new model also provides a promising basis for\nmodelling non-ideal quantum plasmas, which are plasmas in regimes of\nsignificantly stronger coupling than are addressed by the RPA.\n","Comment: 79 pages (including 3 blank), 7 figures"]}]

In the literature, bent idempotents are a special class of bent\nfunctions and few constructions have been presented, which are restricted by\nthe degree of finite fields and have algebraic degree no more than 4. In this\npaper, several new infinite families of bent functions are obtained by adding\nthe the algebraic combination of linear functions to some known bent functions\nand their duals are calculated. These bent functions contain some previous work\non infinite families of bent functions by Mesnager \\cite{M2014} and Xu et al.\n\\cite{XCX2015}. Further, infinite families of bent idempotents of any possible\nalgebraic degree are constructed from any quadratic bent idempotent. To our\nknowledge, it is the first univariate representation construction of infinite\nfamilies of bent idempotents over $\\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$ of algebraic degree\nbetween 2 and $m$, which solves the open problem on bent idempotents proposed\nby Carlet \\cite{C2014}. And an infinite family of anti-self-dual bent functions\nare obtained. The sum of three anti-self-dual bent functions in such a family\nis also anti-self-dual bent and belongs to this family. This solves the open\nproblem proposed by Mesnager \\cite{M2014}.\n"]}]

The full characterization of\nthe capacity region of the GIC is a long-standing open problem, except the case\nof strong or very strong interference. For general GIC's, many inner bounds\nhave been provided over the years, among of them, the Han-Kobayashi (HK)\nregion, is the most celebrated one. Unfortunately, the calculation of the HK\nregion is prohibitively complex, due to the appearance of some auxiliary random\nvariables, whose optimal choice is an open problem. As in other multi-user\ncommunication systems, these achievable regions are based on ensembles of\ni.i.d.

In this paper, we show that for the GIC, it\nis worthwhile to employ random coding ensembles of codewords with memory.\nSpecifically, we take known achievable regions for the GIC, and\ngeneralize/improve them by allowing dependency between the code symbols. For\nexample, we improve the state-of-the-art HK region by drawing the codewords (of\neach codeword and for each user) from a first-order autoregressive moving\naverage (ARMA) Gaussian process.

We model the workers\ndecision of whether to comply (compute the task) or not (return a bogus result\nto save the computation cost) as a mixed extension of a strategic game among\nworkers. That is, we assume that workers are rational in a game-theoretic\nsense, and that they randomize their strategic choice. Workers are assigned\nmultiple tasks in subsequent rounds. We model the system as an infinitely\nrepeated game of the mixed extension of the strategic game. In each round, the\nmaster decides stochastically whether to accept the answer of the majority or\nverify the answers received, at some cost. Incentives and/or penalties are\napplied to workers accordingly. Under the above framework, we study the\nconditions in which the master can reliably obtain tasks results, exploiting\nthat the repeated games model captures the effect of long-term interaction.\nThat is, workers take into account that their behavior in one computation will\nhave an effect on the behavior of other workers in the future. Indeed, should a\nworker be found to deviate from some agreed strategic choice, the remaining\nworkers would change their own strategy to penalize the deviator. Hence, being\nrational, workers do not deviate. We identify analytically the parameter\nconditions to induce a desired worker behavior, and we evaluate experi-\nmentally the mechanisms derived from such conditions.

DWD was originally proposed as a superior\nalternative to the support vector machine (SVM), however DWD is yet to be\npopular compared with the SVM. The main reasons are twofold. First, the\nstate-of-the-art algorithm for solving DWD is based on the second-order-cone\nprogramming (SOCP), while the SVM is a quadratic programming problem which is\nmuch more efficient to solve. Second, the current statistical theory of DWD\nmainly focuses on the linear DWD for the high-dimension-low-sample-size setting\nand data-piling, while the learning theory for the SVM mainly focuses on the\nBayes risk consistency of the kernel SVM. In fact, the Bayes risk consistency\nof DWD is presented as an open problem in the original DWD paper. In this work,\nwe advance the current understanding of DWD from both computational and\ntheoretical perspectives. We propose a novel efficient algorithm for solving\nDWD, and our algorithm can be several hundred times faster than the existing\nstate-of-the-art algorithm based on the SOCP. In addition, our algorithm can\nhandle the generalized DWD, while the SOCP algorithm only works well for a\nspecial DWD but not the generalized DWD. Furthermore, we consider a natural\nkernel DWD in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and then establish the Bayes\nrisk consistency of the kernel DWD. We compare DWD and the SVM on several\nbenchmark data sets and show that the two have comparable classification\naccuracy, but DWD equipped with our new algorithm can be much faster to compute\nthan the SVM.\n"]}]
