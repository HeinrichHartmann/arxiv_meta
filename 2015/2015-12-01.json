Using the theory of gradient elasticity, the non-singular\nfields which are produced by arbitrary dislocation loops are given. `Modified'\nMura, Peach-Koehler, and Burgers formulae are presented in the framework of\ngradient elasticity theory. These formulae are given in terms of an elementary\nfunction, which regularizes the classical expressions, obtained from the Green\ntensor of the Helmholtz-Navier equation and bi-Helmholtz-Navier equation. Using\nthe mathematical method of Green's functions and the Fourier transform, exact,\nanalytical, and non-singular solutions were found. The obtained dislocation\nfields are non-singular due to the regularization of the classical singular\nfields.\n","Comment: 29 pages, to appear in: International Journal of Solids and\n  Structures"]}]

In our model, they are described by two\npolytropic equations of state with index n=+1 and n=-1 respectively.\nFurthermore, the Planck density \\rho_P in the early universe plays a role\nsimilar to the cosmological density \\rho_{\\Lambda} in the late universe. They\nrepresent fundamental upper and lower density bounds differing by 122 orders of\nmagnitude. This quadratic equation of state leads to a fully analytical model\ndescribing the evolution of the universe from the early inflation (Planck era)\nto the late accelerated expansion (de Sitter era). These two phases are bridged\nby a decelerating algebraic expansion (\\alpha-era). This model does not present\nany singularity at t=0 and exists eternally in the past. It admits a scalar\nfield interpretation based on a quintessence field or a tachyon field.\n","Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1208.0801"]}]

However, this belief lacks solid theoretical justifications as\nfar as we know. We investigate role of depth from perspective of margin bound.\nIn margin bound, expected error is upper bounded by empirical margin error plus\nRademacher Average (RA) based capacity term. First, we derive an upper bound\nfor RA of DNN, and show that it increases with increasing depth. This indicates\nnegative impact of depth on test performance. Second, we show that deeper\nnetworks tend to have larger representation power (measured by Betti numbers\nbased complexity) than shallower networks in multi-class setting, and thus can\nlead to smaller empirical margin error. This implies positive impact of depth.\nThe combination of these two results shows that for DNN with restricted number\nof hidden units, increasing depth is not always good since there is a tradeoff\nbetween positive and negative impacts. These results inspire us to seek\nalternative ways to achieve positive impact of depth, e.g., imposing\nmargin-based penalty terms to cross entropy loss so as to reduce empirical\nmargin error without increasing depth.

Researchers have presented various schemes in WSN,\naddressing the problems of processing, bandwidth, load balancing, and efficient\nrouting.

Our goal is an online construction\nof entity retrieval for LCQs. We argue a naive baseline of rewriting LCQs into\nan intersection of an expanded set of composing short concepts leads to highly\nprecise results with extremely low recall. Instead, we propose to augment the\nconcept list, by identifying related concepts of the query concept. However, as\nsuch increase of recall often invites false positives and decreases precision\nin return, we propose the following two techniques: First, we identify concepts\nwith different relatedness to generate linear orderings and pairwise ordering\nconstraints. Second, we rank entities trying to avoid conflicts with these\nconstraints, to prune out lowly ranked one (likely false positives). With these\nnovel techniques, our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.\n"]}]

After extensive study we conclude that the\nspectral index is caused by a nebula with free-free absorption. We find that\nputative nebula must lie beyond the Milky Way. We conclude that FRBs are of\nextra-galactic origin and that they arise in dense star-forming regions. The\nchallenge with extra-galactic models is the the high volumetric rate of FRBs.\nThis high rate allows us to eliminate all models of catastrophic stellar\ndeaths. Hyper-giant flares from young magnetars emerge as the most likely\nprogenitors. Some of the consequences are: (i) Intergalactic FRB models can be\nsafely ignored. (ii) The rich ISM environment of young magnetars can result in\nsignificant contribution to DM, Rotation Measure (RM) and in some cases to\nsignificant free-free optical depth. (iii) The star-forming regions in the host\ngalaxies can contribute significantly to the DM. Including this contribution\nreduces the inferred distances to FRBs and correspondingly increases the\nvolumetric rate of FRBs (and, in turn, may require that giant flares can also\nproduce FRBs). (iv) FRBs are likely to be suppressed at lower frequencies.\nConversely, searching for FRBs at higher frequencies (2-5 GHz) would be\nattractive. (v) The blast wave which produces the radio emission can undergo\nrapid deceleration if the circum-burst medium is dense (as maybe the case for\nFRB121102), leading to X-ray, radio and possibly gamma-ray emission.

To mitigate the potential harms of model misspecification, various\nforms of distributionally robust optimization have been applied. Although many\nof these methodologies suffer from the problem of time-inconsistency, the work\nof Klabjan et al. established a general time-consistent framework for such\nproblems by connecting to the literature on robust Markov decision processes.\n  Motivated by the fact that many forecasting models exhibit special structure,\nas well as a desire to understand the impact of positing different dependency\nstructures, in this paper we formulate and solve a time-consistent\ndistributionally robust multi-stage newsvendor model which naturally unifies\nand robustifies several inventory models with forecasting. In particular, many\nsimple models of demand forecasting have the feature that demand evolves as a\nmartingale. We consider a robust variant of such models, in which the sequence\nof future demands may be any martingale with given mean and support. Under such\na model, past realizations of demand are naturally incorporated into the\nstructure of the uncertainty set going forwards.\n  We explicitly compute the minimax optimal policy (and worst-case\ndistribution) in closed form, by combining ideas from convexity, probability,\nand dynamic programming. We prove that at optimality the worst-case demand\ndistribution corresponds to the setting in which inventory may become obsolete,\na scenario of practical interest. To gain further insight, we prove weak\nconvergence (as the time horizon grows large) to a simple and intuitive\nprocess.

Our result is that in very close vicinities of\ninteger filling factors the AC response of a high-mobility two-dimensional\nstructures behaves as that of a two-dimensional system of localized electrons.\nNamely, both real and imaginary parts of the complex AC conductance at low\ntemperatures agree with the predictions for the two-site model for a\ntwo-dimensional hopping system. Another result is the specific temperature\ndependences of $\\sigma(\\omega)$, which are extremely sensitive to the filling\nfactor value. These dependences indicate a sharp crossover between the\nlocalized modes and a pinned Wigner crystal.\n","Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures"]}]

The experimental measurements of\n$\\Delta M_s$ and $\\Delta \\Gamma_s$ are more precise and agree very well with\ntheoretica predictions, which can also be viewed as a proof of theoretical\ntools, like the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE). CP violating studies in the\n$B_s^0$ system provide essential information to test the SM expectations.\nMixing quantities can be used to study model independent bounds on new physics\n(NP) effects, yielding the familiar picture: the standard model (SM) gives the\ndominant contribution, while there is still some sizable space for NP effects.\nIn the case of $\\Delta M_s$ effects of the order of $15\\%$ are not excluded. In\nthe CP phase $\\phi_s$ due to CP violation in the interference of decays and\nmixing ${\\cal O} (100 \\%)$ effects are still possible. The semi-leptonic CP\nasymmetry $a_{\\rm sl}^s$, which is due to CP violation in mixing, could still\nbe a factor of 250 larger than its robust SM expectation and thus provides a\nvery clean observable for NP searches.
