Applications of this result are often\ncomplicated by the problem, what should be done with the points of $P$ lying\nwithin $Z(f)$? A natural approach is to partition these points with another\npolynomial and continue further in a similar manner. So far it has been pursued\nwith limited success---several authors managed to construct and apply a second\npartitioning polynomial, but further progress has been prevented by technical\nobstacles. We provide a polynomial partitioning method with up to $d$\npolynomials in dimension $d$, which allows for a complete decomposition of the\ngiven point set. We apply it to obtain a new algorithm for the semialgebraic\nrange searching problem. Our algorithm has running time bounds similar to a\nrecent algorithm by Agarwal, Sharir, and the first author [SIAM~J.~Comput.\n42(2013) 2039--2062], but it is simpler both conceptually and technically.\nWhile this paper has been in preparation, Basu and Sombra, as well as Fox,\nPach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl, obtained results concerning polynomial partitions\nwhich overlap with ours to some extent.\n","Comment: 19 pages; The proof that the Groebner basis can be effectively\n  computed is stated in more detail"]}]

Three notions of\nconsistency arise for CSTNs and CSTPs: weak, strong, and dynamic. Dynamic\nconsistency is the most interesting notion, but it is also the most challenging\nand it was conjectured to be hard to assess. Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack\ngave a doubly-exponential time algorithm for deciding whether a CSTN is\ndynamically-consistent and to produce, in the positive case, a dynamic\nexecution strategy of exponential size.

Specifically,\nthe nanotube transistor is converted from ambipolar to unipolar, the device\ndrive current is increased by 2-3 orders of magnitude, the device OFF current\nis suppressed and an excellent Ion/Ioff ratio of six order of magnitude is\nobtained.
