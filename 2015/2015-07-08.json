CALR\nassociated with negative index materials was discovered by Milton and\nNicorovicci in [21] and attracted a lot attention in the scientific community.\nTwo key figures of this phenomenon are the localized resonance, i.e., the\nfields blow up in some regions and remain bounded in some others, and the\nconnection between the localized resonance and the blow up of the power of the\nfields as the loss goes to 0. An important class of negative index materials\nfor which the localized resonance might appear is the class of reflecting\ncomplementary media introduced in [24]. It was showed in [29] that\ncomplementary property of media is not enough to ensure a connection between\nthe blow up of the power and the localized resonance.

This class is rich enough to allow us to cloak an\narbitrary source concentrating on an arbitrary smooth bounded manifold of\ncodimension 1 placed in an arbitrary medium via anomalous localized resonance.\nThe following three properties are established for doubly complementary media:\n1) CALR appears if and only if the power blows up; 2) The power blows up if the\nsource is near the plasmonic structure; 3) The power remains bounded if the\nsource is far away from the plasmonic structure.

One of the most exciting possibilities is the use of stellar\nabundance patterns as \"chemical tags\" to identify stars that were born in the\nsame molecular cloud. In this paper we assess the prospects of chemical tagging\nas a function of several key underlying parameters. We show that in the\nfiducial case of $10^4$ distinct cells in chemical space and $10^5-10^6$ stars\nin the survey, one can expect to detect $\\sim 10^2-10^3$ groups that are $\\ge\n5\\sigma$ overdensities in the chemical space. However, we find that even very\nlarge overdensities in chemical space do not guarantee that the overdensity is\ndue to a single set of stars from a common birth cloud. In fact, for our\nfiducial model parameters, the typical $5\\sigma$ overdensity is comprised of\nstars from a wide range of clusters with the most dominant cluster contributing\nonly 25% of the stars. The most important factors limiting the identification\nof disrupted clusters via chemical tagging are the number of chemical cells in\nthe chemical space and the survey sampling rate of the underlying stellar\npopulation. Both of these factors can be improved through strategic\nobservational plans. While recovering individual clusters through chemical\ntagging may prove challenging, we show, in agreement with previous work, that\ndifferent CMFs imprint different degrees of clumpiness in chemical space. These\ndifferences provide the opportunity to statistically reconstruct the slope and\nhigh mass cutoff of CMF and its evolution through cosmic time.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 12 figures, ApJ (Accepted for publication- 2015 May 28)"]}]

We consider two nearly\nface-on inclinations, 5 disk masses, 7 disk radii, and 2 different typical\npre-main-sequence host stars (T Tauri, Herbig Ae). We calculate up to 141\nindividual velocity-channel maps for five molecules/isotopoloques in a total of\n32 rotational transitions to investigate the frequency dependence of the\nstructures indicated above. We find that the majority of protoplanetary disks\nin our parameter space could be detected in the molecular lines considered.\nHowever, unlike the continuum case, gap detection is not straightforward in\nlines. For example, gaps are not seen in symmetric rings but are masked by the\npattern caused by the global (Keplerian) velocity field. We identify specific\nregions in the velocity-channel maps that are characteristic of planet-induced\nstructures. Simulations of high angular resolution molecular line observations\ndemonstrate the potential of ALMA to provide complementary information about\nthe planet-disk interaction as compared to continuum observations. In\nparticular, the detection of planet-induced gaps is possible under certain\nconditions.(abridged)\n","Comment: 19 pages, 19 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"]}]

However, this emission can be affected by line\nabsorption from Li-like ions in the same medium. We investigate this absorption\nof He-like triplets and present the implications for diagnostics of plasmas in\nphotoionisation equilibrium using the line ratios of the triplets. Our\ncomputations were carried out for the O VI and Fe XXIV absorption of the O VII\nand Fe XXV triplet emission lines, respectively. The fluorescent emission by\nthe Li-like ions and continuum absorption of the He-like ion triplet lines are\nalso investigated. We determine the absorption of the triplet lines as a\nfunction of Li-like ion column density and velocity dispersion of the emitting\nand absorbing medium. We find O VI line absorption can significantly alter the\nO VII triplet line ratios in optically-thin plasmas, by primarily absorbing the\nintercombination lines, and to a lesser extent, the forbidden line. Because of\nintrinsic line absorption by O VI inside a photoionised plasma, the predicted\nratio of forbidden to intercombination line intensity for the O VII triplet\nincreases from 4 up to an upper limit of 16. This process can explain the\ntriplet line ratios that are higher than expected and that are seen in some\nX-ray observations of photoionised plasmas. For the Fe XXV triplet, line\nabsorption by Fe XXIV becomes less apparent owing to significant fluorescent\nemission by Fe XXIV. Without taking the associated Li-like ion line absorption\ninto account, the density diagnosis of photoionised plasmas using the observed\nline ratios of the He-like ion triplet emission lines can be unreliable,\nespecially for low-Z ions.\n","Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics, 6 pages, 4\n  figures"]}]

The first part is an introduction to classical and\nquantum information theory (CIT, QIT): basic definitions and tools of CIT are\nintroduced, such as the information content of a random variable, the typical\nset, and some principles of data compression. Some concepts and results of QIT\nare then introduced, such as the qubit, the pure and mixed states, the Holevo\ntheorem, the no-cloning theorem, and the quantum complementarity. In the second\npart, two applications of QIT to open problems in theoretical physics are\ndiscussed. The black hole (BH) information paradox is related to the phenomenon\nof the Hawking radiation (HR). Consid- ering a BH starting in a pure state,\nafter its complete evaporation only the Hawking radiation will remain, which is\nshown to be in a mixed state. This either describes a non-unitary evolution of\nan isolated system, contradicting the evolution postulate of quantum mechanics\nand violating the no-cloning theorem, or it implies that the initial\ninformation content can escape the BH, therefore contradicting general\nrelativity. The progress toward the solution of the paradox is discussed. The\nrenormalization group (RG) aims at the extraction of the macroscopic\ndescription of a physical system from its microscopic description.

To compensate for the severe path loss in mmWave systems,\nlarge antenna arrays are generally used to achieve significant beamforming\ngains. However, due to the high hardware and power consumption cost associated\nwith radio frequency (RF) chains, it is desirable to achieve the large-antenna\ngains, but with only limited number of RF chains for mmWave communications. To\nthis end, we study in this paper a new lens antenna array enabled mmWave MIMO\ncommunication system. We first show that the array response of the proposed\nlens antenna array at the receiver/transmitter follows a \"sinc\" function, where\nthe antenna with the peak response is determined by the angle of arrival\n(AoA)/departure (AoD) of the received/transmitted signal. By exploiting this\nunique property of lens antenna arrays along with the multi-path sparsity of\nmmWave channels, we propose a novel low-cost and capacity-achieving MIMO\ntransmission scheme, termed \\emph{orthogonal path division multiplexing\n(OPDM)}. For channels with insufficiently separated AoAs and/or AoDs, we also\npropose a simple \\emph{path grouping} technique with group-based small-scale\nMIMO processing to mitigate the inter-path interference.

These unique capabilities combined with the\nhovering, high maneuverability and reliability of multirotor vehicles, results\nin a disruptive technology for both civil and military application including\nair/water search and rescue, inspection, repairs and survey missions among\nothers. The invention was built on a bio-inspired locomotion force analysis\nthat combines flight and swimming. Three main advances in the present work has\nallowed this invention. The first is the discovery of a seamless transition\nmethod between air and underwater. The second is the design of a multi-medium\npropulsion system capable of efficient operation in air and underwater. The\nthird combines the requirements for lift and thrust for flight (for a given\nweight) and the requirements for thrust and neutral buoyancy (in water) for\nswimming. The result is a careful balance between lift, thrust, weight, and\nneutral buoyancy implemented in the vehicle design. A fully operational\nprototype demonstrated the flight, and underwater navigation capabilities as\nwell as the rapid air/water and water/air transition.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 11 figures, 1 table"]}]

We show the graph selection\nconsistency of this method in the sense that the posterior probability of the\ntrue model converges to one. When there are multiple groups of data available,\ninstead of estimating the networks independently for each group, joint\nestimation of the networks may utilize the shared information among groups and\nlead to improved estimation for each individual network. Our method is extended\nto jointly estimate GGMs in multiple groups of data with complex structures,\nincluding spatial data, temporal data and data with both spatial and temporal\nstructures. Markov random field (MRF) models are used to efficiently\nincorporate the complex data structures. We develop and implement an efficient\nalgorithm for statistical inference that enables parallel computing. Simulation\nstudies suggest that our approach achieves better accuracy in network\nestimation compared with methods not incorporating spatial and temporal\ndependencies when there are shared structures among the networks, and that it\nperforms comparably well otherwise. Finally, we illustrate our method using the\nhuman brain gene expression microarray dataset, where the expression levels of\ngenes are measured in different brain regions across multiple time periods.\n"]}]
