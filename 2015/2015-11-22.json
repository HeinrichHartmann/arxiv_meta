NOvA\nuses a highly active, finely segmented detector design that offers superb event\nidentification capability, allowing precision measurements of \\nu_e/\\nu_e-bar\nappearance and \\nu_\\mu/\\nu_\\mu-bar disappearance, through which NOvA will\nprovide constraints on \\theta_13, \\theta_23, |\\Delta m^2_atm|, the neutrino\nmass hierarchy, and the CP-violating phase \\delta. In this article, we review\nNOvA's uniquely broad physics scope, including sensitivity updates in light of\nthe latest knowledge of \\theta_13, and we discuss the experiment's construction\nand operation timeline.\n","Comment: 7 pages, 13 figures, to appear in the proceedings of the XXV\n  International Conference on Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics (Neutrino 2012)"]}]
