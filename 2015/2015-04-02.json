While there are empirical\nsuggestions of particular increasing length scales that accompany such\ntransitions, this identification is not universal. To better understand such\nbehavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in\nstochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature\nclassical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature\nto include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or\nstochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical\nsystems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of\nspace-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation\nrelates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative\nsystems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body\nquantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the\nabsence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible\nlattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point \"quantum dynamical\nheterogeneity\" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially\nnon-uniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not\nexhibit a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale\nof the dynamical heterogeneities can increase dramatically. We study \"quantum\njamming\" and illustrate how a hard core bosonic system may undergo a zero\ntemperature quantum critical metal-to-insulator-type transition with an\nextremely large effective dynamical exponent z>4 consistent with length scales\nthat increase far more slowly than the relaxation time as a putative critical\ntransition is approached.

It enables one to\ntake account of all mechanisms of wave scattering, both related to boundary\nroughness and to contacts between the wire rough section and the leads within\nthe same technical frameworks. The rough part of the conducting wire is shown\nto act as a mode-specific randomly modulated effective potential barrier whose\nheight is governed essentially by the asperity slope. The mean height of the\nbarrier specifies the number of conducting channels. Under relatively small\nasperity amplitude this number can take on arbitrary small values if the\nasperities are sufficiently sharp. The channel cut-off that arises when the\nasperity sharpness increases can be regarded as a kind of localization, which\nis not related to the disorder but rather is of entropic origin. The\nfluctuating part of the barrier results in two fundamentally different types of\nguided wave scattering, viz., inter- and intramode scattering. The intermode\nscattering is shown to be for the most part very strong except in the cases of\n(a) extremely smooth asperities, (b) excessively small length of the corrugated\nsegment, and (c) the asperities sharp enough for only one conducting channel to\nremain in the wire. Under strong intermode scattering, a new set of conducting\nchannels develops, which have the form of decoupled extended modes subject to\nindividual random potentials. In view of this fact, two transport regimes only\nare realizable in randomly corrugated multimode wires, specifically, the\nballistic and the localized regime, the latter characteristic of\none-dimensional random systems. Two kinds of localization are thus shown to\ncoexist in waveguide-like systems with randomly corrugated boundaries,\nspecifically, the entropic localization and the one-dimensional Anderson\nlocalization.\n","Comment: 43 pages, 6 figures, final version as published in Annals of Physics"]}]

Rather than\nsimulating the system at the temperature of interest, an annealing algorithm\nstarts at a temperature that is high enough to ensure ergodicity and gradually\ndecreases it until the destination temperature is reached. This idea is used in\npopular algorithms such as parallel tempering and simulated annealing. A\ngeneral problem with annealing methods is that they require a temperature\nschedule. Choosing well-balanced temperature schedules can be tedious and\ntime-consuming. Imbalanced schedules can have a negative impact on the\nconvergence, runtime and success of annealing algorithms.

Ensemble annealing simultaneously simulates a physical\nsystem and estimates its density of states. The temperatures are lowered not\naccording to a prefixed schedule but adaptively so as to maintain a constant\nrelative entropy between successive ensembles.

This has implications for\ntools such as Optimal Power Flow (OPF), an optimization problem widely used in\npower system operations and planning, which should be adjusted to account for\nthis uncertainty. One way to handle the uncertainty is to formulate a Chance\nConstrained OPF (CC-OPF) which limits the probability of constraint violation\nto a predefined value. However, existing CC-OPF formulations and solutions are\nnot immune to drawbacks. On one hand, they only consider affine policies for\ngeneration control, which are not always realistic and may be sub-optimal.

The current best lower bound for the\ndeterminantal complexity of the d by d permanent polynomial is d^2/2, due to\nMignon and Ressayre in 2004. Inspired by their proof method, we introduce a\nnatural rank concept of polynomials, called the bi-polynomial rank. The\nbi-polynomial rank is related to width of an arithmetic branching program. The\nbi-polynomial rank of a homogeneous polynomial p of even degree 2k is defined\nas the minimum n such that p can be written as a summation of n products of\npolynomials of degree k. We prove that the bi-polynomial rank gives a lower\nbound of the determinantal complexity. As a consequence, the above Mignon and\nRessayre bound is improved to (d-1)^2 + 1 over the field of reals. We show that\nthe computation of the bi-polynomial rank is formulated as a rank minimization\nproblem. Applying the concave minimization technique, we reduce the problem of\nlower-bounding determinantal complexity to that of proving the positive\nsemidefiniteness of matrices, and this is a new approach for the permanent vs.\ndeterminant problem.

The time\nevolution of the quasi-periodicity in these parameters connected with the Suns\nrotation reveals that their synodic period is stable and is aprox 26-27 days.\nThis means that the changes in the solar wind speed and IMF are related to the\nSuns near equatorial regions in considering the differential rotation of the\nSun. However, the solar wind parameters observed near the Earths orbit provide\nonly the conditions in the limited local vicinity of the equatorial region in\nthe heliosphere (within in latitude). We also demonstrate that the observed\nperiod of the GCR intensity connected with the Suns rotation increased up to\naprox 33-36 days in 2009. This means that the process driving the 27-day\nvariations of the GCR intensity takes place not only in the limited local\nsurroundings of the equatorial region but in the global 3-D space of the\nheliosphere, covering also higher latitude regions. A relatively long period (\naprox 34 days) found for 2009 in the GCR intensity gives possible evidence of\nthe onset of cycle 24 due to active regions at higher latitudes and rotating\nslowly because of the Suns differential rotation. We also discuss the effect of\ndifferential rotation on the theoretical model of the 27-day variations of the\nGCR intensity.\n","Comment: article published in Solar Physics (2013)"]}]

A\nrecently-proposed method of obtaining rigorous bounds of long-time average cost\nis first outlined for the uncontrolled system with polynomials of system state\non the right-hand side. In this method the polynomial constraints are relaxed\nto be sum-of-squares and formulated as semi-definite programs. It was proposed\nto use the upper bound of long-time average cost as the objective function\ninstead of the time-average cost itself in controller design. In the present\npaper this suggestion is implemented for a particular system and is shown to\ngive good results. Designing the optimal controller by this method requires\noptimising simultaneously both the control law and a tunable function similar\nto the Lyapunov function. The new approach proposed and implemented in this\npaper for overcoming the inherent non-convexity of this optimisation is based\non a formal assumption that the amplitude of control is small. By expanding the\ntunable function and the bound in the small parameter, the long-time average\ncost is reduced by minimizing the respective bound in each term of the series.\nThe derivation of all the polynomial coefficients in controller is given in\nterms of the solvability conditions of state-dependent linear and bilinear\ninequalities. The resultant sum-of-squares problems are solved in sequence,\nthus avoiding the non-convexity in optimization. The proposed approach is\nimplemented for a simple model of oscillatory vortex shedding behind a\ncylinder.\n","Comment: 14 pages, 3 figures"]}]
