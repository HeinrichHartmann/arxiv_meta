More exactly, for a given perfect\ncode C of length n=(q^m-1)/(q-1) over F_q with a parity check matrix H_m, we\ndefine a new code C_{(m,r)} of length n over F_{q^r}, r > 1, with this parity\ncheck matrix H_m. The resulting code C_{(m,r)} is completely regular with\ncovering radius R = min{r,m}. We compute the intersection numbers of such codes\nand, finally, we prove that Hamming codes are the only codes that, after\nlifting the ground field, result in completely regular codes.\n","Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory"]}]
