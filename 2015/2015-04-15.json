We find that the maximum observed dust polarization\nfraction is high (pmax > 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dust\ncolumn density (AV < 1mag) regions. There is a systematic decrease in the dust\npolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret the\nfeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignment\npredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. We also\ncharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angle\ndispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,\nthe polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated by\nfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field sky\nprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust column\ndensity. The polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with the\ndispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likely\ndue to fluctuations in the 3D magnetic field orientation along the line of\nsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.We also compare the dust\nemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the Planck LFI,\nwith low-frequency radio data, and with Faraday rotation measurements of\nextragalactic sources. The two polarized components are globally similar in\nstructure along the plane and notably in the Fan and North Polar Spur regions.\nA detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust and\ncosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirms\nthat much of the variation observed in the Planck data is due to the 3D\nstructure of the magnetic field.\n"]}]

We find that an estimate of this\nparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction\n$p_\\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered on\nlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. This emphasizes the impact\nof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. The\ndecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecular\nclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentially\ndue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation of\nvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such an\nanti-correlation. In the simulations, polarization fractions are also found to\nanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\\mathcal{S}$.

The dust grains that emit the radiation seen by\nPlanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in the\nvisible. Comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellar\npolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique new\ndiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. Using\nancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,\nwe obtain the degree of polarization, $p_V$ , and the optical depth in the V\nband to the star, $\\tau_V$. Toward these stars we measure the submillimetre\npolarized intensity, $P_S$, and total intensity, $I_S$, in the Planck 353 GHz\nchannel. For those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium with\ncomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directions\nclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visible\nto find two ratios, $R_{S/V} = (P_S/I_S)/(p_V/\\tau_V)$ and $R_{P/p} = P_S/p_V$\n, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the aligned\ngrain population alone.

However, our estimate of $R_{P/p}$ is not compatible with predictions,\nwhich are too low by a factor of about 2.5.

The framework uses a dense, overlapping set of image regions at\nmultiple scales and a \"local model,\" such as a slanted-plane model for stereo\ndisparity, that is expected to be valid piecewise across the visual field.\nEstimation is cast as optimization over a dichotomous mixture of variables,\nsimultaneously determining which regions are inliers with respect to the local\nmodel (binary variables) and the correct co-ordinates in the local model space\nfor each inlying region (continuous variables). When the regions are organized\ninto a multi-scale hierarchy, optimization can occur in an efficient and\nparallel architecture, where distributed computational units iteratively\nperform calculations and share information through sparse connections between\nparents and children. The framework performs well on a standard benchmark for\nbinocular stereo, and it produces a distributional scene representation that is\nappropriate for combining with higher-level reasoning and other low-level cues.\n","Comment: Accepted to CVPR 2015.

Therefore, the environment seems to enhance the probability of a galaxy\nto host a radio AGN. Moreover, a distinction between high power and low power\nradio AGNs leads to the conclusion that the significance in the environmental\neffect is maintained only for low power radio sources. By studying the\nevolution of stellar masses it is possible to conclude that radio AGN presence\nis a phenomenon related to quiescent galaxies up to $z=2$, with a significant\nincrease of the fraction of quiescent galaxies hosting a radio AGN with\ndecreasing redshift.

Each row of the constraint matrix\n$A$ corresponds to a covering constraint. In the online problem, each row of\n$A$ comes online and the algorithm must maintain a feasible assignment $x$ and\nmay only increase $x$ over time. The (offline) convex packing problem is\nmodeled by the following convex program: $\\max_{y\\in R_+^m} \\sum_{j = 1}^m y_j\n- g(A^T y)$, where $g : R_+^n \\mapsto R_+$ is a monotone and convex cost\nfunction. It is the Fenchel dual program of convex covering when $g$ is the\nconvex conjugate of $f$.

Yet, at the time being, robots are lacking good visual\nperceptual systems, which often become the main bottleneck preventing the use\nof autonomous agents for real-world applications.\n  Lately in computer vision, systems that learn suitable visual representations\nand based on multi-layer deep convolutional networks are showing remarkable\nperformance in tasks such as large-scale visual recognition and image\nretrieval. To this regard, it is natural to ask whether such remarkable\nperformance would generalize also to the robotic setting.\n  In this paper we investigate such possibility, while taking further steps in\ndeveloping a computational vision system to be embedded on a robotic platform,\nthe iCub humanoid robot. In particular, we release a new dataset ({\\sc\niCubWorld28}) that we use as a benchmark to address the question: {\\it how many\nobjects can iCub recognize?} Our study is developed in a learning framework\nwhich reflects the typical visual experience of a humanoid robot like the iCub.\nExperiments shed interesting insights on the strength and weaknesses of current\ncomputer vision approaches applied in real robotic settings.\n","Comment: 18 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables"]}]

This problem can be remedied by using the two-stage least\nsquares (TSLS) estimator, based on the availability of valid instrumental\nvariables (IVs). This reduction in bias, however, is offset by an increase in\nvariance. Under standard assumptions, the OLS has indeed a larger bias than the\nTSLS estimator; and moreover, one can prove that the sample variance of the OLS\nestimator is no greater than the one of the TSLS. Therefore, it is natural to\nask whether one could combine the desirable properties of the OLS and TSLS\nestimators. Such a trade-off can be achieved through a convex combination of\nthese two estimators, thereby producing our proposed convex least squares (CLS)\nestimator. The relative contribution of the OLS and TSLS estimators is here\nchosen to minimize a sample estimate of the mean squared error (MSE) of their\nconvex combination. This proportion parameter is proved to be unique, whenever\nthe OLS and TSLS differ in MSEs.

The theory is managed to be generalized naturally having strictly\nreviewed a series of its key positions depending on a sign of particle masses.\nThereby, it is possible to remove the artificial restriction contradicting the\nmore fundamental principle of action functional additivity. Additionally, as a\ncondition of internal consistency of the theory, particle effective mass\nfunction is found.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 12 references"]}]
