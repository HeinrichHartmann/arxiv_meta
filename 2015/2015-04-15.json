We\nconstruct and analyse large-scale maps of dust polarization fraction and\npolarization direction, while taking account of noise bias and possible\nsystematic effects. We find that the maximum observed dust polarization\nfraction is high (pmax > 18%), in particular in some of the intermediate dust\ncolumn density (AV < 1mag) regions. There is a systematic decrease in the dust\npolarization fraction with increasing dust column density, and we interpret the\nfeatures of this correlation in light of both radiative grain alignment\npredictions and fluctuations in the magnetic field orientation. We also\ncharacterize the spatial structure of the polarization angle using the angle\ndispersion function and find that, in nearby fields at intermediate latitudes,\nthe polarization angle is ordered over extended areas that are separated by\nfilamentary structures, which appear as interfaces where the magnetic field sky\nprojection rotates abruptly without apparent variations in the dust column\ndensity. The polarization fraction is found to be anti-correlated with the\ndispersion of the polarization angle, implying that the variations are likely\ndue to fluctuations in the 3D magnetic field orientation along the line of\nsight sampling the diffuse interstellar medium.We also compare the dust\nemission with the polarized synchrotron emission measured with the Planck LFI,\nwith low-frequency radio data, and with Faraday rotation measurements of\nextragalactic sources. The two polarized components are globally similar in\nstructure along the plane and notably in the Fan and North Polar Spur regions.\nA detailed comparison of these three tracers shows, however, that dust and\ncosmic rays generally sample different parts of the line of sight and confirms\nthat much of the variation observed in the Planck data is due to the 3D\nstructure of the magnetic field.\n"]}]

We find that an estimate of this\nparameter may be recovered from the maximum polarization fraction\n$p_\\mathrm{max}$ in diffuse regions where the magnetic field is ordered on\nlarge scales and perpendicular to the line of sight. This emphasizes the impact\nof anisotropies of the magnetic field on the emerging polarization signal. The\ndecrease of the polarization fraction with column density in nearby molecular\nclouds is well reproduced in the simulations, indicating that it is essentially\ndue to the turbulent structure of the magnetic field: an accumulation of\nvariously polarized structures along the line of sight leads to such an\nanti-correlation. In the simulations, polarization fractions are also found to\nanti-correlate with the angle dispersion function $\\mathcal{S}$.

The dust grains that emit the radiation seen by\nPlanck in the submillimetre also extinguish and polarize starlight in the\nvisible. Comparison of the polarization of the emission and of the interstellar\npolarization on selected lines of sight probed by stars provides unique new\ndiagnostics of the emission and light scattering properties of dust. Using\nancillary catalogues of interstellar polarization and extinction of starlight,\nwe obtain the degree of polarization, $p_V$ , and the optical depth in the V\nband to the star, $\\tau_V$. Toward these stars we measure the submillimetre\npolarized intensity, $P_S$, and total intensity, $I_S$, in the Planck 353 GHz\nchannel. For those lines of sight through the diffuse interstellar medium with\ncomparable values of the estimated column density and polarization directions\nclose to orthogonal, we correlate properties in the submillimetre and visible\nto find two ratios, $R_{S/V} = (P_S/I_S)/(p_V/\\tau_V)$ and $R_{P/p} = P_S/p_V$\n, the latter focusing directly on the polarization properties of the aligned\ngrain population alone.

This paper\nfocused on demonstration of multistability phenomenon in radial distribution\nsystems with reversed power flow, where multiple stable equilibria co-exist at\nthe given set of parameters. The system may experience transitions between\ndifferent equilibria after being subjected to disturbances such as short-term\nlosses of distributed generation or transient faults. Convergence to an\nundesirable equilibrium places the system in an emergency or \\textit{in\nextremis} state. Traditional emergency control schemes are not capable of\nrestoring the system if it gets entrapped in one of the low voltage equilibria.\nMoreover, undervoltage load shedding may have a reverse action on the system\nand can induce voltage collapse. We propose a novel pulse emergency control\nstrategy that restores the system to the normal state without any interruption\nof power delivery.

We performed three-dimensional numerical simulations of supernova\nexplosions, in and near turbulent self-gravitating molecular clouds. In order\nto study the influence of the magnetic field, we performed both hydrodynamical\nand magnetohydrodynamical simulations.

Here we present a new lattice QCD simulation showing\nthat the strange magnetic form factor of the Lambda(1405) vanishes, signaling\nthe formation of an antikaon-nucleon molecule.

Using\ndata from the photometric COSMOS survey and the radio 1.4GHz VLA-COSMOS, a\nsample of radio AGNs has been defined. The environment has been studied\nthroughout the use of the richness distributions inside a parallelepipedon with\nbase side of 1 Mpc and height proportional to the photometric redshift\nprecision. Richness distributions have been compared as a function of both the\nredshift and the relative evolution of the stellar masses of galaxies and AGN\nhosts up to $z=2$. Radio AGNs are always located in environments that are\nsignificantly denser than those around galaxies in which radio emission is\nabsent. Therefore, the environment seems to enhance the probability of a galaxy\nto host a radio AGN. Moreover, a distinction between high power and low power\nradio AGNs leads to the conclusion that the significance in the environmental\neffect is maintained only for low power radio sources. By studying the\nevolution of stellar masses it is possible to conclude that radio AGN presence\nis a phenomenon related to quiescent galaxies up to $z=2$, with a significant\nincrease of the fraction of quiescent galaxies hosting a radio AGN with\ndecreasing redshift.

This problem can be remedied by using the two-stage least\nsquares (TSLS) estimator, based on the availability of valid instrumental\nvariables (IVs).

Increasing the lifetime of carriers in\nlight-absorbing materials is necessary to improve open-circuit voltage in\nphotovoltaics [2], charge separation in organic solar cells [3], and charge\ntransfer in photodetection de vices [4]. Here we demonstrate long lifetimes\nover one hundred picoseconds for electron-hole pairs in graphene quantum dots\n(GQDs) due to large transition energies and weak coupling to excitonic states\nbelow the fundamental band gap. This possibility for a large transition energy\nto bound excitons is due to graphene's poor screening, illustrating a unique\nmechanism in this QD to occupy higher-energy states for long timescales. GQD\nedges can be terminated with either armchair or zigzag carbon patterns, and\nthis edge structure changes excited state lifetimes by orders of magnitude.\nThese results indicate nanoscale control of carrier lifetimes in\noptoelectronics.\n","Comment: 5 figures, 3 supplementary figures"]}]
