Our analysis is based on 24 years of Johnson V-band photometry. We\nuse the previously published Continuous Period Search (CPS) method to model the\nevolution of the light curve of LQ Hya. The CPS fits a Fourier series model to\nshort overlapping subsets of data. This enables us to monitor the spot\nconfiguration of the star with a higher time resolution. We find seasonal\nvariability in the mean level and amplitude of the light curve of LQ Hya. The\nvariability of the light curve amplitude seems not to be cyclic, but the\nlong-term variations in the mean magnitude could be explained by an\napproximately 13 year cycle. Because of the limited length of the observed time\nseries, it is not yet possible to determine whether this structure really is\nperiodic and represents an activity cycle. We estimate the differential\nrotation of the star to be small, and the star is potentially very close to a\nrigid rotator. We search for active longitudes and find that on time scales up\nto six months there are typically one or two relatively stable active areas on\nthe star with limited phase migration. On time scales longer than one year, no\nstable active longitudes have been present except for the period between 2003\nand 2009 and possibly also some time before 1995.

This raises questions regarding\nthe optimal investment of this time and money for future surveys. In a previous\nwork, it was shown that a sparse sampling strategy could be a powerful\nsubstitute for the contiguous observations. However, in this previous paper a\nregular sparse sampling was investigated, where the sparse observed patches\nwere regularly distributed on the sky. The regularity of the mask introduces a\nperiodic pattern in the window function, which induces periodic correlations at\nspecific scales. In this paper, we use the Bayesian experimental design to\ninvestigate a random sparse sampling, where the observed patches are randomly\ndistributed over the total sparsely sampled area. We find that, as there is no\npreferred scale in the window function, the induced correlation is evenly\ndistributed amongst all scales. This could be desirable if we are interested in\nspecific scales in the galaxy power spectrum, such as the Baryonic Acoustic\nOscillation (BAO) scales. However, for constraining the overall galaxy power\nspectrum and the cosmological parameters, there is no preference over regular\nor random sampling.

Here, we propose an improvement to the\noriginal sequencing by tunneling method, in which $N$ pairs of electrodes are\nbuilt in series along a synthetic nanochannel. While the ssDNA is forced\nthrough the channel using a longitudinal field it passes by each pair of\nelectrodes for long enough time to gather a minimum of $m$ tunneling current\nmeasurements, where $m$ is determined by the level of sequencing error desired.\nEach current time series for each nucleobase is then cross-correlated together,\nfrom which the DNA bases can be distinguished. We show using random sampling of\ndata from classical molecular dynamics, that indeed the sequencing error is\nsignificantly reduced as the number of pairs of electrodes, $N$, increases.\nCompared to the sequencing ability of a single pair of electrodes,\ncross-correlating $N$ pairs of electrodes is exponentially better due to the\napproximate log-normal nature of the tunneling current probability\ndistributions. We have also used the Fenton-Wilkinson approximation to\nanalytically describe the mean and variance of the cross-correlations that are\nused to distinguish the DNA bases. The method we suggest is particularly useful\nwhen the measurement bandwidth is limited, allowing a smaller electrode gap\nresidence time while still promising to consistently identify the DNA bases\ncorrectly.\n","Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures"]}]

In\nparticular, we demonstrate that \"star formation dilution\" by HII regions causes\na significant bias against AGN selection in low-mass, blue, star-forming,\ndisk-dominated galaxies. This bias is responsible for the observed preference\nof AGNs among high-mass, green, moderately star-forming, bulge-dominated hosts.\nWe account for the bias and simulate the intrinsic population of emission-line\nAGNs using a physically-motivated Eddington ratio distribution, intrinsic AGN\nnarrow line region line ratios, a luminosity-dependent Lbol/L[OIII] bolometric\ncorrection, and the observed Mbh-sigma relation. These simulations indicate\nthat, in massive (log(M*/Msun) > 10) galaxies, AGN accretion is correlated with\nspecific star formation rate but is otherwise uniform with stellar mass. There\nis some hint of lower black hole occupation in low-mass (log(M*/Msun) < 10)\nhosts, although our modeling is limited by uncertainties in measuring and\ninterpreting the velocity dispersions of low-mass galaxies. The presence of\nstar formation dilution means that AGNs contribute little to the observed\nstrong optical emission lines (e.g., [OIII] and Ha) in low-mass and\nstar-forming hosts. However the AGN population recovered by our modeling\nindicates that feedback by typical (low- to moderate-accretion) low-redshift\nAGNs has nearly uniform efficiency at all stellar masses, star formation rates,\nand morphologies. Taken together, our characterization of the observational\nbias and resultant AGN occupation function suggest that AGNs are unlikely to be\nthe dominant source of star formation quenching in galaxies, but instead are\nfueled by the same gas which drives star formation activity.\n","Comment: ApJ accepted. 36 pages, 33 figures.

In this paper we go beyond the approximation of uniform\nheating and quantify the heating rate fluctuations due to the clustered\ndistribution of blazars and how this impacts on the thermal history of the IGM.\nWe analytically compute a filtering function that relates the heating rate\nfluctuations to the underlying dark matter density field. We implement it in\nthe cosmological code GADGET-3 and perform large scale simulations to determine\nthe impact of inhomogeneous heating. We show that, because of blazar\nclustering, blazar heating is inhomogeneous for z>= 2. At high redshift, the\ntemperature-density relation shows an important scatter and presents a low\ntemperature envelope of unheated regions, in particular at low densities and\nwithin voids. However, the median temperature of the IGM is close to that in\nthe uniform case, albeit slightly lower at low redshift.

For accretion rates $\\gtrsim 10\n\\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$, there is sufficient gas in the funnel to make this region\noptically thick. Radiation from the disk first flows into the funnel, after\nwhich it accelerates the optically thick funnel gas along the axis.

Furthermore, ~65% of the false positives from the\nmodel are very metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] < -2.0 dex). The synthetic-oversampling\nmethod is biased towards the discovery of warm (~F-type) stars, a consequence\nof the targeting bias from the SDSS/SEGUE survey. This EMP selection method\nrepresents a significant improvement over alternative broadband optical\nselection techniques. The models are applied to >12 million stars, with an\nexpected yield of ~600 new EMP stars, which promises to open new avenues for\nexploring the early universe.\n","Comment: 15 pages, 7 figures, to be submitted to ApJ"]}]

Rapid radiative\ncooling reduces the effective buoyancy and allows the VSI to operate.

It then limits the\ndetection of small planetary RV signals (eg, an Earth-mass planet in the\nhabitable zone of a solar-like star). In previous papers, we studied the\ndetectability of such planets around the Sun seen as an edge-on star. For that\npurpose, we computed the RV and photometric variations induced by solar\nmagnetic activity, using all active structures observed over one entire cycle.\nOur goal is to perform similar studies on stars with different physical and\ngeometrical properties. As a first step, we focus on Sun-like stars seen with\nvarious inclinations, and on estimating detection capabilities with forthcoming\ninstruments. To do so, we first parameterize the solar active structures with\nthe most realistic pattern so as to obtain results consistent with the observed\nones. We simulate the growth, evolution and decay of solar spots, faculae and\nnetwork, using parameters and empiric laws derived from solar observations and\nliterature. We generate the corresponding structure lists over a full solar\ncycle. We then build the resulting spectra and deduce the RV and photometric\nvariations for a `Sun' seen with various inclinations. The produced RV signal\ntakes into account the photometric contribution of structures as well as the\nattenuation of the convective blueshift. The comparison between our simulated\nactivity pattern and the observed one validates our model. We show that the\ninclination of the stellar rotation axis has a significant impact on the time\nseries.

New radial velocities (RVs) of the red dwarf and BV RCIC light\ncurves are solved simultaneously along with white dwarf and red dwarf RVs from\nthe literature, uvby data, the MOST mission light curve, and 40 years of\neclipse timings. Precision-based weighting is the key to proper information\nbalance among the various datasets. Timewise variation of modeled starspots\nallows unified solution of multiple data eras. Light curve amplitudes strongly\nsuggest decreasing spottedness from 1976 to about 1980, followed by\napproximately constant spot coverage from 1981 to 2005. An explanation is\nproposed for lack of noticeable variation in 1981 light curves, in terms of\ncompetition between spot and tidal variations. Photometric spectroscopic\ndistance is estimated. The red dwarf mass comes out larger than normal for a\nK2V star, and even larger than adopted in several structure and evolution\npapers. An identified cause for this result is that much improved red dwarf RVs\ncurves now exist.\n"]}]

We analyse the dispersed spectra and reconstruct the emission measure\ndistribution using spectral line analysis. The resulting elemental abundances\nexhibit inverse first ionisation potential effect in both cases. An analysis of\nHe-like triplets yields a range of coronal electron densities ~10^10-10^13\ncm-3. Since HD 155555 AB is classified both as an RS CVn and a PMS star, we\ncompare our results with those of other slightly older active main-sequence\nstars and T Tauri stars, which indicates that the coronal properties of HD\n155555 AB closely resemble that of an older RS CVn binary rather than a younger\nPMS star. Our results also suggests that the properties of HD 155555 C is very\nsimilar to those of other active M dwarfs.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 23 figues, Accepted in ApJ"]}]

We\ndemonstrated that the physical model reproducing the main observables of SN\n1987A during the first 250 days of evolution reproduces also the X-ray emission\nof the subsequent expanding remnant, thus bridging the gap between supernovae\nand supernova remnants. By comparing model results with observations, we\nconstrained the explosion energy in the range $1.2-1.4\\times 10^{51}$~erg and\nthe envelope mass in the range $15-17 M_{\\odot}$. We found that the shape of\nX-ray lightcurves and spectra at early epochs (<15 years) reflects the\nstructure of outer ejecta: our model reproduces the observations if the\noutermost ejecta have a post-explosion radial profile of density approximated\nby a power law with index $\\alpha = -8$. At later epochs, the shapes of X-ray\nlightcurves and spectra reflect the density structure of the nebula around SN\n1987A. This enabled us to ascertain the origin of the multi-thermal X-ray\nemission, to disentangle the imprint of the supernova on the remnant emission\nfrom the effects of the remnant interaction with the environment, and to\nconstrain the pre-supernova structure of the nebula.\n","Comment: 16 pages, 11 Figures; accepted for publication on ApJ"]}]

Using comparison theorems for porous media\nequation from V\\'azquez 2007 we obtain estimates between the PI's for the\noriginal gas flow and auxiliary flow with a distributed source.

Informally, an exchange-repair of a source instance is\nanother source instance that differs minimally from the first, but has a\nsolution. Exchange-repairs give rise to a natural notion of exchange-repair\ncertain answers (XR-certain answers) for target queries.

Our methods rely on\nstochastic approximations, which are computationally efficient as they maintain\none iterate as a parameter estimate, and successively update that iterate based\non a single data point. When the update is based on a noisy gradient, the\nstochastic approximation is known as standard stochastic gradient descent,\nwhich has been fundamental in modern applications with large data sets.\nAdditionally, our methods are numerically stable because they employ implicit\nupdates of the iterates. Intuitively, an implicit update is a shrinked version\nof a standard one, where the shrinkage factor depends on the observed Fisher\ninformation at the corresponding data point. This shrinkage prevents numerical\ndivergence of the iterates, which can be caused either by excess noise or\noutliers.

This finding is in\nmarked contrast with the well-known result of the classical theory, where such\nwaves do not exist in a homogeneous (isotropic or anisotropic) half-space. In\nthe context of the classical theory, this weakness is usually circumvented by\nmodeling the half-space as a layered structure or as having non-homogeneous\nproperties. On the other hand, employing a simplified version of gradient\nelasticity (including only one microstructural parameter and an additional\nsurface-energy term), Vardoulakis and Georgiadis (1997), and Georgiadis et al.\n(2000), showed that such surface waves may exist in a homogeneous half-space\nonly if a certain type of gradient anisotropy is included in the formulation.\nOn the contrary, in the present work, we prove that the complete Toupin-Mindlin\ntheory of isotropic gradient elasticity (with five microstructural parameters)\nis capable of predicting torsional and SH surface waves in a purely isotropic\nand homogeneous material. In fact, it is shown that torsional and SH surface\nwaves are dispersive and can propagate at any frequency (i.e. no cut-off\nfrequencies appear).

We apply several simple\nprescriptions to relate the intergalactic dust density to the gas density in\nthe simulation, thereby obtaining dust extinctions that may be directly\ncompared to the observed distribution of supernova magnitudes. Our analysis is\nsensitive to the spatial distribution of grey dust, but is not dependent on its\nintrinsic properties such as its opacity or grain size. We present an\napplication of our technique to the supernova data of Perlmutter et al., who\nfind that their high redshift sample is ~0.2 magnitudes fainter than the\nexpectation for a non-accelerating, low-density universe. We find that for grey\ndust to be responsible, it must be distributed quite smoothly, e.g., tracing\nintergalactic gas. More realistic dust distributions, such as dust tracing the\nmetal density, are inconsistent with observations at the 1.5-2 sigma level.\nUpcoming observations and improved modelling of the dust distribution should\nlead to stronger constraints on intergalactic grey dust extinction.\n","Comment: 4 pages, 4 ps figures, emulateapj.sty, submitted to ApJ Lett"]}]
