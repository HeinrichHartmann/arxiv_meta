Spray cycles are scheduled at intervals two days short of the\nfirst interlarval period and halted once the last of the female flies that\noriginated from pre-spray-deposited pupae have been sprayed twice. The effect\nof temperature on the aerial spraying of tsetse, through its reproductive cycle\nand general population dynamics, is of particular interest, given that cooler\nweather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Spray efficacy\nis found to come at a price due to the greater number of cycles necessitated by\ncooler weather. The extra cost is argued to be worth while. Pupae, still in the\nground at the end of spraying, are identified as the main threat to a\nsuccessful operation. They are slightly more vulnerable at the low temperature\nextreme of tsetse habitat (16 $^\\circ$C), when the cumulative, natural pupal\nmortality is high. One can otherwise base one's expectations on the closeness\nwith which the time to the third last spray approaches one puparial duration. A\ndisparity of anything close to the length of a spray cycle advocates caution,\nwhereas one which comes close to vanishing should be interpreted as being\nauspicious. Three such key temperatures, just below which one can anticipate an\nimproved outcome and just above which caution should be exercised, are 17.146\n$^\\circ$C, 19.278 $^\\circ$C and 23.645 $^\\circ$C. A refinement of the existing\nformulae for the puparial duration and the first interlarval period might be\nprudent in the South African context of a sympatric Glossina brevipalpis-G.\nausteni, tsetse population. The resulting aerial spraying strategy would then\nbe formulated using a G. brevipalpis puparial duration and a G. austeni first\ninterlarval period.\n","Comment: 31 pages, 10 figures"]}]

The calculated formation\nenergies for single inert-gas atoms at interstitial sites as well as at\nsubstitutional sites are much larger for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe than for He.

Since the structure of\npartial separability and multipartite entanglement is getting complicated if\nthe number of subsystems exceeds two, one can not expect the existence of an\nultimate scalar entanglement measure, which grasps even a small part of the\nrich hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement, and some higher order\nstructure characterizing that is needed. In this paper we make some steps\ntowards this direction.\n  First, we reveal the lattice-theoretic structure of the partial separability\nclassification, introduced earlier [Sz. Szalay and Z. Kokenyesi, Phys. Rev. A\n86, 032341 (2012)]. It turns out that, mathematically, the structure of the\nentanglement classes is the up-set lattice of the structure of the different\nkinds of partial separability, which is the down-set lattice of the lattice of\nthe partitions of the subsystems. It turns also out that, physically, this\nstructure is related to the LOCC convertibility: If a state from a class can be\nmapped into another one, then that class can be found higher in the hierarchy.\n  Second, we introduce the notion of multipartite monotonicity, expressing that\na given set of entanglement monotones, while measuring the different kinds of\nentanglement, shows also the same hierarchical structure as the entanglement\nclasses. Then we construct such hierarchies of entanglement measures, and\npropose a physically well-motivated one, being the direct multipartite\ngeneralization of the entanglement of formation based on the entanglement\nentropy, motivated by the notion of statistical distinguishability. The\nmultipartite monotonicity shown by this set of measures motivates us to\nconsider the measures to be the different manifestations of some \"unified\"\nnotion of entanglement.\n","Comment: Final version, result about the class hierarchy is strengthened,\n  references are added, typos are corrected.

Our numerical\nresults indicate that the transition separating area and volume law scaling of\nthe EE does not coincide with the non-thermal to thermal transition.\nConsequently, there exists an extended non-ergodic phase for an intermediate\nenergy window where the many body eigenstates violate the ETH while manifesting\nvolume law EE scaling. We also establish that the model possesses an infinite\ntemperature many body localization transition despite the existence of a single\nparticle mobility edge. We propose a practical scheme to test our predictions\nin atomic optical lattice experiments which can directly probe the effects of\nthe mobility edge.\n","Comment: 5+5 pages, 7 figures, replaced with published version"]}]

In his seminal work, John\nBell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can\nreproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local\nrealist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an\ninequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to\nquantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the\nfundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades,\nnumerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because\nof experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional\nassumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in\nloopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such\nadditional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's\ninequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of\nhigh-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin\nreadout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use\nof fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation\nof 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions.

The AIA data on 304, 193, 211, and 94 \\AA sample the transition\nregion and the corona, respectively, while HMI provides photospheric\nmagnetograms, continuum, and linear polarization data, in addition to the fully\ninverted data provided by HMI.\n  [...]\n  We have observed a supergranular-sized emergence close to a large filament in\nthe boundary of the active region NOAA11850. Filament dynamics and magnetogram\nresults suggest that the magnetic flux emergence takes place in the\nphotospheric level below the filament. Reconnection occurs underneath the\nfilament between the dipped lines that support the filament and the\nsupergranular emergence. The very smooth ascent is probably caused by this\nemergence and torus instability may play a fundamental role, which is helped by\nthe emergence.\n","Comment: 9 pages, 6 figures, online material at Journal"]}]

In a Landau Fermi\nLiquid, the single-impurity Kondo effect is the screening of an impurity spin\nat low temperature $T$. The two-impurity Kondo model then describes the\ncompetition between the Kondo interaction and the Heisenberg interaction\nbetween two impurity spins, also called the RKKY interaction. For spin-$1/2$\nimpurities, that competition leads to a quantum phase transition from a\nKondo-screened phase to a phase in which the two impurity spins screen one\nanother. Our holographic model is based on a $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT\ndescription of the two-impurity Kondo model, reliable for two impurities with\nnegligible separation in space. We consider only impurity spins in a totally\nanti-symmetric representation of an $SU(N)$ spin symmetry. We employ a\nlarge-$N$ limit, in which both Kondo and RKKY couplings are double-trace, and\nboth Kondo and inter-impurity screening appear as condensation of single-trace\noperators at the impurities' location. We perform the holographic\nrenormalization of our model, which allows us to identify the Kondo and RKKY\ncouplings as boundary conditions on fields in AdS. We numerically compute the\nphase diagram of our model in the plane of RKKY coupling versus $T$, finding\nevidence for a quantum phase transition from a trivial phase, with neither\nKondo nor inter-impurity screening, to a non-trivial phase, with both Kondo and\nanti-ferromagnetic inter-impurity screening.

Additionally, a combination of wire cost\nand spine economy notions is considered as a meta-principle, and it is found\nthat this proposition gives only marginally better results than either pure\nwire volume minimization or pure spine economy maximization, but only if spine\neconomy component dominates. In sum, these results suggest that the new spine\neconomy principle may be important for brain evolutionary design in a broader\ncontext.\n","Comment: Theoretical paper on optimization of connections in the brain, with\n  comparison to the data"]}]

Then we prove a non-linear optional decomposition in a robust\nsetting, extending recent results of [63], which we then use to obtain a\nsuperhedging duality in uncertain, incomplete and non-linear financial markets.\nFinally, we relate, under addi- tional regularity assumptions, the value\nfunction to a viscosity solution of an appropriate path-dependent partial\ndifferential equation (PPDE).\n","Comment: 44 pages"]}]

Next, we investigate\nelaborately the way of linking of external programs with mathematica, so-called\nthe mathlink operation. Using this technique we can run very tedious jobs quite\nefficiently, and the operations become extremely fast. Sometimes it is quite\ndesirable to run jobs in background of a computer which can take considerable\namount of time to finish, and this allows us to do work on other tasks, while\nkeeping the jobs running. The way of running jobs, written in a mathematica\nnotebook, in background is quite different from the conventional methods i.e.,\nthe techniques for the programs written in other languages like C, C++, F77,\nF90, F95, etc. To illustrate it, in the present article we study how to create\na mathematica batch-file from a mathematica notebook and run it in the\nbackground. Finally, we explore the most significant issue of this article.\nHere we describe the basic ideas for parallelizing a mathematica program by\nsharing its independent parts into all other remote computers available in the\nnetwork. Doing the parallelization, we can perform large computational\noperations within a very short period of time, and therefore, the efficiency of\nthe numerical works can be achieved. Parallel computation supports any version\nof mathematica and it also works significantly well even if different versions\nof mathematica are installed in different computers. All the operations studied\nin this article run under any supported operating system like Unix, Windows,\nMacintosh, etc. For the sake of our illustrations, here we concentrate all the\ndiscussions only for the Unix based operating system.\n","Comment: 17 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:cs/0603005, arXiv:cs/0604088"]}]
